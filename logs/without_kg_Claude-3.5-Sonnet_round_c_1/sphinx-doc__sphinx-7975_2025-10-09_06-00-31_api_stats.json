Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/`\n- **Result**: Identified main Sphinx project structure with key directories including `sphinx/builders/` and `sphinx/environment/`\n\n### 2. HTML Builder Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/builders/html/`\n- **Result**: Found main HTML builder file (`__init__.py`) which imports `IndexEntries` from `sphinx.environment.adapters.indexentries`\n\n### 3. Index Generation Logic Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Result**: Located the core `IndexEntries` class responsible for index creation and sorting\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located the relevant code files for index generation\n- Identified the `IndexEntries.create_index()` method as the main entry point\n- Found the sorting logic in the `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115)\n- Discovered Unicode normalization and character classification logic\n\n### 🔍 Key Technical Findings\n1. **Index Sorting Logic**: The `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115) handles sorting of index entries\n2. **Unicode Handling**: Uses `unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())` for normalization\n3. **Symbol Classification**: Logic at lines 111-112 determines if entries are alphabetic or symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   ```\n4. **Grouping Logic**: The `group_entries` parameter controls entry grouping behavior\n\n### 🚧 Current Investigation Point\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Lines**: 101-150 (sorting and grouping logic)\n- **Status**: Partially analyzed - need to complete reading the file to understand how section headers (\"Symbols\", \"A\", \"B\", etc.) are generated\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete file analysis**: Read remaining lines (151-176) of `indexentries.py` to understand section header generation\n2. **Identify grouping mechanism**: Find where/how entries are grouped into sections like \"Symbols\"\n3. **Locate the bug**: Determine why special characters are creating multiple \"Symbols\" sections\n4. **Test case creation**: Create a minimal test case to reproduce the issue\n5. **Bug fix implementation**: Modify the grouping logic to ensure all non-alphabetic characters are grouped into a single \"Symbols\" section\n\n## Technical Context\n- **Framework**: Sphinx documentation generator\n- **Language**: Python\n- **Issue Type**: Index generation and character classification bug\n- **Affected Component**: HTML builder index output\n- **Root Cause Area**: Likely in the character classification or section grouping logic within `IndexEntries.create_index()`\n\nThe investigation is approximately 60% complete, with the core problematic code area identified but requiring further analysis to pinpoint the exact bug location and implement a fix.",

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/`\n- **Result**: Identified main Sphinx project structure with key directories including `sphinx/builders/` and `sphinx/environment/`\n\n### 2. HTML Builder Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/builders/html/`\n- **Result**: Found main HTML builder file (`__init__.py`) which imports `IndexEntries` from `sphinx.environment.adapters.indexentries`\n\n### 3. Index Generation Logic Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Result**: Located the core `IndexEntries` class responsible for index creation and sorting\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located the relevant code files for index generation\n- Identified the `IndexEntries.create_index()` method as the main entry point\n- Found the sorting logic in the `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115)\n- Discovered Unicode normalization and character classification logic\n\n### 🔍 Key Technical Findings\n1. **Index Sorting Logic**: The `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115) handles sorting of index entries\n2. **Unicode Handling**: Uses `unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())` for normalization\n3. **Symbol Classification**: Logic at lines 111-112 determines if entries are alphabetic or symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   ```\n4. **Grouping Logic**: The `group_entries` parameter controls entry grouping behavior\n\n### 🚧 Current Investigation Point\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Lines**: 101-150 (sorting and grouping logic)\n- **Status**: Partially analyzed - need to complete reading the file to understand how section headers (\"Symbols\", \"A\", \"B\", etc.) are generated\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete file analysis**: Read remaining lines (151-176) of `indexentries.py` to understand section header generation\n2. **Identify grouping mechanism**: Find where/how entries are grouped into sections like \"Symbols\"\n3. **Locate the bug**: Determine why special characters are creating multiple \"Symbols\" sections\n4. **Test case creation**: Create a minimal test case to reproduce the issue\n5. **Bug fix implementation**: Modify the grouping logic to ensure all non-alphabetic characters are grouped into a single \"Symbols\" section\n\n## Technical Context\n- **Framework**: Sphinx documentation generator\n- **Language**: Python\n- **Issue Type**: Index generation and character classification bug\n- **Affected Component**: HTML builder index output\n- **Root Cause Area**: Likely in the character classification or section grouping logic within `IndexEntries.create_index()`\n\nThe investigation is approximately 60% complete, with the core problematic code area identified but requiring further analysis to pinpoint the exact bug location and implement a fix.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI found the IndexEntries class which handles index creation.

    "response": "#REFLECT\nPerfect! I found the bug! Looking at the code in lines 157-176, I can see exactly what's happening:\n\n1. The `keyfunc3` function (lines 158-174) is responsible for grouping entries by letter/section\n2. Line 167 extracts the first character: `letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()`\n3. Lines 168-172 determine the section name:\n   - If it's alphabetic or underscore → return the letter\n   - Otherwise → return \"Symbols\"\n\nHowever, the problem is in the sorting logic in `keyfunc` (lines 103-115). The sorting puts some symbols before alphabetic characters and some after, but the grouping logic in `keyfunc3` treats ALL non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\".\n\nThis creates two separate \"Symbols\" groups:\n1. Symbols that sort before letters (like @)\n2. Symbols that sort after letters (like £, ←)\n\nThe bug is that the sorting and grouping logic are inconsistent.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/`\n- **Result**: Identified main Sphinx project structure with key directories including `sphinx/builders/` and `sphinx/environment/`\n\n### 2. HTML Builder Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/builders/html/`\n- **Result**: Found main HTML builder file (`__init__.py`) which imports `IndexEntries` from `sphinx.environment.adapters.indexentries`\n\n### 3. Index Generation Logic Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Result**: Located the core `IndexEntries` class responsible for index creation and sorting\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located the relevant code files for index generation\n- Identified the `IndexEntries.create_index()` method as the main entry point\n- Found the sorting logic in the `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115)\n- Discovered Unicode normalization and character classification logic\n\n### 🔍 Key Technical Findings\n1. **Index Sorting Logic**: The `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115) handles sorting of index entries\n2. **Unicode Handling**: Uses `unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())` for normalization\n3. **Symbol Classification**: Logic at lines 111-112 determines if entries are alphabetic or symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   ```\n4. **Grouping Logic**: The `group_entries` parameter controls entry grouping behavior\n\n### 🚧 Current Investigation Point\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Lines**: 101-150 (sorting and grouping logic)\n- **Status**: Partially analyzed - need to complete reading the file to understand how section headers (\"Symbols\", \"A\", \"B\", etc.) are generated\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete file analysis**: Read remaining lines (151-176) of `indexentries.py` to understand section header generation\n2. **Identify grouping mechanism**: Find where/how entries are grouped into sections like \"Symbols\"\n3. **Locate the bug**: Determine why special characters are creating multiple \"Symbols\" sections\n4. **Test case creation**: Create a minimal test case to reproduce the issue\n5. **Bug fix implementation**: Modify the grouping logic to ensure all non-alphabetic characters are grouped into a single \"Symbols\" section\n\n## Technical Context\n- **Framework**: Sphinx documentation generator\n- **Language**: Python\n- **Issue Type**: Index generation and character classification bug\n- **Affected Component**: HTML builder index output\n- **Root Cause Area**: Likely in the character classification or section grouping logic within `IndexEntries.create_index()`\n\nThe investigation is approximately 60% complete, with the core problematic code area identified but requiring further analysis to pinpoint the exact bug location and implement a fix.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI found the IndexEntries class which handles index creation. The issue is about duplicate \"Symbols\" sections for entries with special characters like @, £, and ←.

The `keyfunc3` function (lines 158-174) groups all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\", but because of the sorting split, it creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections\n4. Both sections get the same anchor name, causing navigation issues\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe sorting logic needs to be modified so that ALL symbols (non-alphabetic characters) are grouped together, either all at the beginning or all at the end of the index.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 111-112** - Primary sorting logic that causes symbol splitting\n- Current logic: `if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'): lckey = chr(127) + lckey`\n- This puts alphabetic chars at the end, but leaves symbols scattered based on Unicode values\n- Fix: Modify to ensure all symbols sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic entries)\n\n**Location 2: Lines 108-110** - Unicode normalization and RTL handling\n- The normalization and RTL mark removal affects how characters are classified\n- May need adjustment to ensure consistent symbol classification\n\n**Location 3: Lines 167-172** - Section header generation logic in keyfunc3\n- This determines when to create \"Symbols\" vs letter sections\n- The logic is correct but relies on consistent sorting from keyfunc\n\n**Location 4: Lines 153-155** - Similar sorting logic in keyfunc2 for sub-entries\n- Has the same pattern as the main sorting function\n- Needs to be kept consistent with the main fix\n\n**Location 5: Lines 149-155** - The keyfunc2 function for sub-index sorting\n- Contains duplicate logic that should match the main sorting behavior\n- Ensures sub-entries are sorted consistently with main entries\n\nThe core issue is in the sorting logic that splits symbols into two groups, while the grouping logic expects them to be together.

Index Generation Logic Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Result**: Located the core `IndexEntries` class responsible for index creation and sorting\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located the relevant code files for index generation\n- Identified the `IndexEntries.create_index()` method as the main entry point\n- Found the sorting logic in the `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115)\n- Discovered Unicode normalization and character classification logic\n\n### 🔍 Key Technical Findings\n1. **Index Sorting Logic**: The `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115) handles sorting of index entries\n2. **Unicode Handling**: Uses `unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())` for normalization\n3. **Symbol Classification**: Logic at lines 111-112 determines if entries are alphabetic or symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   ```\n4. **Grouping Logic**: The `group_entries` parameter controls entry grouping behavior\n\n### 🚧 Current Investigation Point\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Lines**: 101-150 (sorting and grouping logic)\n- **Status**: Partially analyzed - need to complete reading the file to understand how section headers (\"Symbols\", \"A\", \"B\", etc.) are generated\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete file analysis**: Read remaining lines (151-176) of `indexentries.py` to understand section header generation\n2. **Identify grouping mechanism**: Find where/how entries are grouped into sections like \"Symbols\"\n3. **Locate the bug**: Determine why special characters are creating multiple \"Symbols\" sections\n4. **Test case creation**: Create a minimal test case to reproduce the issue\n5. **Bug fix implementation**: Modify the grouping logic to ensure all non-alphabetic characters are grouped into a single \"Symbols\" section\n\n## Technical Context\n- **Framework**: Sphinx documentation generator\n- **Language**: Python\n- **Issue Type**: Index generation and character classification bug\n- **Affected Component**: HTML builder index output\n- **Root Cause Area**: Likely in the character classification or section grouping logic within `IndexEntries.create_index()`\n\nThe investigation is approximately 60% complete, with the core problematic code area identified but requiring further analysis to pinpoint the exact bug location and implement a fix.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI found the IndexEntries class which handles index creation. The issue is about duplicate \"Symbols\" sections for entries with special characters like @, £, and ←.

Line 167 extracts the first character: `letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()`\n3. Lines 168-172 determine the section name:\n   - If it's alphabetic or underscore → return the letter\n   - Otherwise → return \"Symbols\"\n\nHowever, the problem is in the sorting logic in `keyfunc` (lines 103-115). The sorting puts some symbols before alphabetic characters and some after, but the grouping logic in `keyfunc3` treats ALL non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\".\n\nThis creates two separate \"Symbols\" groups:\n1. Symbols that sort before letters (like @)\n2. Symbols that sort after letters (like £, ←)\n\nThe bug is that the sorting and grouping logic are inconsistent.

Now I have a complete understanding of the bug and can identify the exact locations that need to be fixed.\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. The `keyfunc` function (lines 103-115) sorts entries, putting alphabetic characters at the end by prepending `chr(127)`\n2. This causes symbols to be split into two groups: those that naturally sort before letters (like @) and those that sort after letters (like £, ←)\n3. The `keyfunc3` function (lines 158-174) groups all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\", but because of the sorting split, it creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections\n4. Both sections get the same anchor name, causing navigation issues\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe sorting logic needs to be modified so that ALL symbols (non-alphabetic characters) are grouped together, either all at the beginning or all at the end of the index.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 111-112** - Primary sorting logic that causes symbol splitting\n- Current logic: `if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'): lckey = chr(127) + lckey`\n- This puts alphabetic chars at the end, but leaves symbols scattered based on Unicode values\n- Fix: Modify to ensure all symbols sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic entries)\n\n**Location 2: Lines 108-110** - Unicode normalization and RTL handling\n- The normalization and RTL mark removal affects how characters are classified\n- May need adjustment to ensure consistent symbol classification\n\n**Location 3: Lines 167-172** - Section header generation logic in keyfunc3\n- This determines when to create \"Symbols\" vs letter sections\n- The logic is correct but relies on consistent sorting from keyfunc\n\n**Location 4: Lines 153-155** - Similar sorting logic in keyfunc2 for sub-entries\n- Has the same pattern as the main sorting function\n- Needs to be kept consistent with the main fix\n\n**Location 5: Lines 149-155** - The keyfunc2 function for sub-index sorting\n- Contains duplicate logic that should match the main sorting behavior\n- Ensures sub-entries are sorted consistently with main entries\n\nThe core issue is in the sorting logic that splits symbols into two groups, while the grouping logic expects them to be together. The fix should modify the sorting to keep all symbols together.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nTwo sections called Symbols in index\nWhen using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries after the ”normal” words.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/`\n- **Result**: Identified main Sphinx project structure with key directories including `sphinx/builders/` and `sphinx/environment/`\n\n### 2. HTML Builder Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/builders/html/`\n- **Result**: Found main HTML builder file (`__init__.py`) which imports `IndexEntries` from `sphinx.environment.adapters.indexentries`\n\n### 3. Index Generation Logic Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Result**: Located the core `IndexEntries` class responsible for index creation and sorting\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located the relevant code files for index generation\n- Identified the `IndexEntries.create_index()` method as the main entry point\n- Found the sorting logic in the `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115)\n- Discovered Unicode normalization and character classification logic\n\n### 🔍 Key Technical Findings\n1. **Index Sorting Logic**: The `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115) handles sorting of index entries\n2. **Unicode Handling**: Uses `unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())` for normalization\n3. **Symbol Classification**: Logic at lines 111-112 determines if entries are alphabetic or symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   ```\n4. **Grouping Logic**: The `group_entries` parameter controls entry grouping behavior\n\n### 🚧 Current Investigation Point\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Lines**: 101-150 (sorting and grouping logic)\n- **Status**: Partially analyzed - need to complete reading the file to understand how section headers (\"Symbols\", \"A\", \"B\", etc.) are generated\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete file analysis**: Read remaining lines (151-176) of `indexentries.py` to understand section header generation\n2. **Identify grouping mechanism**: Find where/how entries are grouped into sections like \"Symbols\"\n3. **Locate the bug**: Determine why special characters are creating multiple \"Symbols\" sections\n4. **Test case creation**: Create a minimal test case to reproduce the issue\n5. **Bug fix implementation**: Modify the grouping logic to ensure all non-alphabetic characters are grouped into a single \"Symbols\" section\n\n## Technical Context\n- **Framework**: Sphinx documentation generator\n- **Language**: Python\n- **Issue Type**: Index generation and character classification bug\n- **Affected Component**: HTML builder index output\n- **Root Cause Area**: Likely in the character classification or section grouping logic within `IndexEntries.create_index()`\n\nThe investigation is approximately 60% complete, with the core problematic code area identified but requiring further analysis to pinpoint the exact bug location and implement a fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 111\nEnd line: 112\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 108\nEnd line: 110\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 167\nEnd line: 172\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 153\nEnd line: 155\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 149\nEnd line: 155\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI found the IndexEntries class which handles index creation.

But the problem is that different special characters like @, £, and ← have different Unicode values and may sort differently, potentially creating separate \"Symbols\" sections.\n\nLet me read the rest of the file to see how the section headers are generated.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 151, \"end_line\": 176 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 151-176:\n\n 151:             if key.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 152:                 key = key[1:]\n 153:             if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n 154:                 key = chr(127) + key\n 155:             return key\n 156: \n 157:         # group the entries by letter\n 158:         def keyfunc3(item: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n 159:             # hack: mutating the subitems dicts to a list in the keyfunc\n 160:             k, v = item\n 161:             v[1] = sorted(((si, se) for (si, (se, void, void)) in v[1].items()),\n 162:                           key=keyfunc2)\n 163:             if v[2] is None:\n 164:                 # now calculate the key\n 165:                 if k.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 166:                     k = k[1:]\n 167:                 letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n 168:                 if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n 169:                     return letter\n 170:                 else:\n 171:                     # get all other symbols under one heading\n 172:                     return _('Symbols')\n 173:             else:\n 174:                 return v[2]\n 175:         return [(key_, list(group))\n 176:                 for (key_, group) in groupby(newlist, keyfunc3)]\n\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! I found the bug! Looking at the code in lines 157-176, I can see exactly what's happening:\n\n1. The `keyfunc3` function (lines 158-174) is responsible for grouping entries by letter/section\n2. Line 167 extracts the first character: `letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()`\n3. Lines 168-172 determine the section name:\n   - If it's alphabetic or underscore → return the letter\n   - Otherwise → return \"Symbols\"\n\nHowever, the problem is in the sorting logic in `keyfunc` (lines 103-115). The sorting puts some symbols before alphabetic characters and some after, but the grouping logic in `keyfunc3` treats ALL non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\".\n\nThis creates two separate \"Symbols\" groups:\n1. Symbols that sort before letters (like @)\n2. Symbols that sort after letters (like £, ←)\n\nThe bug is that the sorting and grouping logic are inconsistent. Let me search for how this is used in the HTML builder to understand the complete picture.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"create_index\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/builders/html\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'create_index' in directory (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py\nLines 658-664:\n 658:     def write_genindex(self) -> None:\n 659:         # the total count of lines for each index letter, used to distribute\n 660:         # the entries into two columns\n 661:         genindex = IndexEntries(self.env).create_index(self)\n 662:         indexcounts = []\n 663:         for _k, entries in genindex:\n 664:             indexcounts.append(sum(1 + len(subitems)\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug! The issue is in the sorting logic in the `keyfunc` function (lines 103-115) in `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`.\n\nThe problem:\n1. The sorting logic treats alphabetic characters differently by prepending `chr(127)` to them (lines 111-112)\n2. This means symbols sort in two groups: before alphabetic chars and after alphabetic chars\n3. But the grouping logic in `keyfunc3` (lines 168-172) treats ALL non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\"\n4. This creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections in the final output\n\nThe fix should ensure all symbols are grouped together, regardless of their Unicode sorting position. Let me examine the exact lines that need to be modified.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 103, \"end_line\": 115 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 103-115:\n\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the bug and can identify the exact locations that need to be fixed.\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. The `keyfunc` function (lines 103-115) sorts entries, putting alphabetic characters at the end by prepending `chr(127)`\n2. This causes symbols to be split into two groups: those that naturally sort before letters (like @) and those that sort after letters (like £, ←)\n3. The `keyfunc3` function (lines 158-174) groups all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\", but because of the sorting split, it creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections\n4. Both sections get the same anchor name, causing navigation issues\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe sorting logic needs to be modified so that ALL symbols (non-alphabetic characters) are grouped together, either all at the beginning or all at the end of the index.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 111-112** - Primary sorting logic that causes symbol splitting\n- Current logic: `if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'): lckey = chr(127) + lckey`\n- This puts alphabetic chars at the end, but leaves symbols scattered based on Unicode values\n- Fix: Modify to ensure all symbols sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic entries)\n\n**Location 2: Lines 108-110** - Unicode normalization and RTL handling\n- The normalization and RTL mark removal affects how characters are classified\n- May need adjustment to ensure consistent symbol classification\n\n**Location 3: Lines 167-172** - Section header generation logic in keyfunc3\n- This determines when to create \"Symbols\" vs letter sections\n- The logic is correct but relies on consistent sorting from keyfunc\n\n**Location 4: Lines 153-155** - Similar sorting logic in keyfunc2 for sub-entries\n- Has the same pattern as the main sorting function\n- Needs to be kept consistent with the main fix\n\n**Location 5: Lines 149-155** - The keyfunc2 function for sub-index sorting\n- Contains duplicate logic that should match the main sorting behavior\n- Ensures sub-entries are sorted consistently with main entries\n\nThe core issue is in the sorting logic that splits symbols into two groups, while the grouping logic expects them to be together. The fix should modify the sorting to keep all symbols together.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Sphinx index generation code, I've identified the root cause of the bug where special characters like @, £, and ← create two separate \"Symbols\" sections instead of being grouped together.\n\nThe issue stems from inconsistent sorting logic that splits symbols into two groups (before and after alphabetic characters) while the grouping logic expects all symbols to be in one section.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 111,\n            \"end_line\": 112\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 108,\n            \"end_line\": 110\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 167,\n            \"end_line\": 172\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 153,\n            \"end_line\": 155\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 149,\n            \"end_line\": 155\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe problem statement the project is:\nTwo sections called Symbols in index\nWhen using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries after the ”normal” words.  Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n",

Change the condition to explicitly handle symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       lckey = chr(1) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures all symbols appear in one group before alphabetic entries, preventing the split.\n\n2. **Lines 108-110 (Unicode normalization)**: The normalization logic is correct but needs to work consistently with the modified sorting. Ensure the RTL mark removal happens before character classification:\n   ```python\n   lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n   if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n       lckey = lckey[1:]\n   ```\n   This supports the primary fix by ensuring consistent character classification.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Section header generation)**: The grouping logic is actually correct - it properly identifies all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\". This works with fixes 1 and 2 to ensure only one \"Symbols\" section is created:\n   ```python\n   letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n   if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n       return letter\n   else:\n       # get all other symbols under one heading\n       return _('Symbols')\n   ```\n   No change needed here - this logic will work correctly once sorting is fixed.\n\n4. **Lines 153-155 (Sub-entry sorting)**: Apply the same symbol sorting logic to sub-entries for consistency:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       key = chr(127) + key\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       key = chr(1) + key\n   ```\n   This ensures sub-entries follow the same sorting pattern as main entries.\n\n5. **Lines 149-155 (keyfunc2 function)**: The entire keyfunc2 function needs the same modification as the main keyfunc to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries. The fix in location 4 addresses this by ensuring the same sorting logic is applied.\n\nThe core solution is to modify the sorting logic to force all symbols to sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic characters) while keeping the existing grouping logic unchanged.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/`\n- **Result**: Identified main Sphinx project structure with key directories including `sphinx/builders/` and `sphinx/environment/`\n\n### 2. HTML Builder Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/builders/html/`\n- **Result**: Found main HTML builder file (`__init__.py`) which imports `IndexEntries` from `sphinx.environment.adapters.indexentries`\n\n### 3. Index Generation Logic Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Result**: Located the core `IndexEntries` class responsible for index creation and sorting\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located the relevant code files for index generation\n- Identified the `IndexEntries.create_index()` method as the main entry point\n- Found the sorting logic in the `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115)\n- Discovered Unicode normalization and character classification logic\n\n### 🔍 Key Technical Findings\n1. **Index Sorting Logic**: The `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115) handles sorting of index entries\n2. **Unicode Handling**: Uses `unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())` for normalization\n3. **Symbol Classification**: Logic at lines 111-112 determines if entries are alphabetic or symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   ```\n4. **Grouping Logic**: The `group_entries` parameter controls entry grouping behavior\n\n### 🚧 Current Investigation Point\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Lines**: 101-150 (sorting and grouping logic)\n- **Status**: Partially analyzed - need to complete reading the file to understand how section headers (\"Symbols\", \"A\", \"B\", etc.) are generated\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete file analysis**: Read remaining lines (151-176) of `indexentries.py` to understand section header generation\n2. **Identify grouping mechanism**: Find where/how entries are grouped into sections like \"Symbols\"\n3. **Locate the bug**: Determine why special characters are creating multiple \"Symbols\" sections\n4. **Test case creation**: Create a minimal test case to reproduce the issue\n5. **Bug fix implementation**: Modify the grouping logic to ensure all non-alphabetic characters are grouped into a single \"Symbols\" section\n\n## Technical Context\n- **Framework**: Sphinx documentation generator\n- **Language**: Python\n- **Issue Type**: Index generation and character classification bug\n- **Affected Component**: HTML builder index output\n- **Root Cause Area**: Likely in the character classification or section grouping logic within `IndexEntries.create_index()`\n\nThe investigation is approximately 60% complete, with the core problematic code area identified but requiring further analysis to pinpoint the exact bug location and implement a fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 111\nEnd line: 112\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 108\nEnd line: 110\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 167\nEnd line: 172\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 153\nEnd line: 155\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 149\nEnd line: 155\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture!

Now I have a complete understanding of the bug and can identify the exact locations that need to be fixed.\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. The `keyfunc` function (lines 103-115) sorts entries, putting alphabetic characters at the end by prepending `chr(127)`\n2. This causes symbols to be split into two groups: those that naturally sort before letters (like @) and those that sort after letters (like £, ←)\n3. The `keyfunc3` function (lines 158-174) groups all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\", but because of the sorting split, it creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections\n4. Both sections get the same anchor name, causing navigation issues\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe sorting logic needs to be modified so that ALL symbols (non-alphabetic characters) are grouped together, either all at the beginning or all at the end of the index.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 111-112** - Primary sorting logic that causes symbol splitting\n- Current logic: `if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'): lckey = chr(127) + lckey`\n- This puts alphabetic chars at the end, but leaves symbols scattered based on Unicode values\n- Fix: Modify to ensure all symbols sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic entries)\n\n**Location 2: Lines 108-110** - Unicode normalization and RTL handling\n- The normalization and RTL mark removal affects how characters are classified\n- May need adjustment to ensure consistent symbol classification\n\n**Location 3: Lines 167-172** - Section header generation logic in keyfunc3\n- This determines when to create \"Symbols\" vs letter sections\n- The logic is correct but relies on consistent sorting from keyfunc\n\n**Location 4: Lines 153-155** - Similar sorting logic in keyfunc2 for sub-entries\n- Has the same pattern as the main sorting function\n- Needs to be kept consistent with the main fix\n\n**Location 5: Lines 149-155** - The keyfunc2 function for sub-index sorting\n- Contains duplicate logic that should match the main sorting behavior\n- Ensures sub-entries are sorted consistently with main entries\n\nThe core issue is in the sorting logic that splits symbols into two groups, while the grouping logic expects them to be together. The fix should modify the sorting to keep all symbols together.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Sphinx index generation code, I've identified the root cause of the bug where special characters like @, £, and ← create two separate \"Symbols\" sections instead of being grouped together.\n\nThe issue stems from inconsistent sorting logic that splits symbols into two groups (before and after alphabetic characters) while the grouping logic expects all symbols to be in one section.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 111,\n            \"end_line\": 112\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 108,\n            \"end_line\": 110\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 167,\n            \"end_line\": 172\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 153,\n            \"end_line\": 155\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 149,\n            \"end_line\": 155\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture! The problem is exactly as I analyzed - the sorting logic creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections because some symbols (like @) sort before alphabetic characters while others (like £ and ←) sort after them. Both sections get the same \"Symbols\" name and anchor, causing navigation issues.\n\nThe locator has identified the exact suspicious locations that need to be fixed. Let me provide targeted repair suggestions for each location.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Lines 111-112 (Primary sorting logic)**: Modify the sorting logic to ensure ALL symbols are grouped together by forcing non-alphabetic characters to sort consistently. Change the condition to explicitly handle symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       lckey = chr(1) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures all symbols appear in one group before alphabetic entries, preventing the split.\n\n2. **Lines 108-110 (Unicode normalization)**: The normalization logic is correct but needs to work consistently with the modified sorting. Ensure the RTL mark removal happens before character classification:\n   ```python\n   lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n   if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n       lckey = lckey[1:]\n   ```\n   This supports the primary fix by ensuring consistent character classification.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Section header generation)**: The grouping logic is actually correct - it properly identifies all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\". This works with fixes 1 and 2 to ensure only one \"Symbols\" section is created:\n   ```python\n   letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n   if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n       return letter\n   else:\n       # get all other symbols under one heading\n       return _('Symbols')\n   ```\n   No change needed here - this logic will work correctly once sorting is fixed.\n\n4. **Lines 153-155 (Sub-entry sorting)**: Apply the same symbol sorting logic to sub-entries for consistency:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       key = chr(127) + key\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       key = chr(1) + key\n   ```\n   This ensures sub-entries follow the same sorting pattern as main entries.\n\n5. **Lines 149-155 (keyfunc2 function)**: The entire keyfunc2 function needs the same modification as the main keyfunc to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries. The fix in location 4 addresses this by ensuring the same sorting logic is applied.\n\nThe core solution is to modify the sorting logic to force all symbols to sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic characters) while keeping the existing grouping logic unchanged. This will result in a single \"Symbols\" section with a single anchor, fixing both the duplicate sections and the navigation link issues.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 111-112\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n                lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 108-110\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n            if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n                lckey = lckey[1:]\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 167-172\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n                if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n                    return letter\n                else:\n                    # get all other symbols under one heading\n                    return _('Symbols')\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 153-155\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n                key = chr(127) + key\n            return key\n\n\n[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 149-155\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        def keyfunc2(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n            key = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', entry[0].lower())\n            if key.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n                key = key[1:]\n            if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n                key = chr(127) + key\n            return key\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nTwo sections called Symbols in index\nWhen using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries after the ”normal” words.  Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nLooking at the provided code segments, I can see exactly how the bug manifests:\n\n**Location 1 (lines 111-112)**: This is the core issue. The current logic only adds `chr(127)` to alphabetic characters and underscores, leaving symbols to sort by their natural Unicode values. This causes symbols like @ (ASCII 64) to sort before letters, while symbols like £ (Unicode 163) and ← (Unicode 8592) sort after the `chr(127)` prefix added to letters.\n\n**Location 2 (lines 108-110)**: The Unicode normalization is correct and supports the fix.\n\n**Location 3 (lines 167-172)**: This grouping logic correctly identifies all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\", but because of the sorting split from Location 1, it creates two separate groups both named \"Symbols\".\n\n**Location 4 & 5 (lines 153-155 and 149-155)**: These have the same problematic logic as Location 1 for sub-entries.\n\nThe fix is clear: modify the sorting logic to ensure ALL symbols sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic characters) instead of being split based on their Unicode values.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, these locations are ready for fixing. The root cause is clear:\n\n1. **Primary Issue (Locations 1, 4, 5)**: The sorting logic splits symbols into two groups - those that naturally sort before letters (like @) and those that sort after letters (like £, ←). This happens because only alphabetic characters get the `chr(127)` prefix, leaving symbols to sort by their natural Unicode values.\n\n2. **Secondary Effect (Location 3)**: The grouping logic correctly identifies all symbols as \"Symbols\", but due to the sorting split, it creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections with the same name and anchor.\n\n3. **Supporting Logic (Location 2)**: The Unicode normalization works correctly and will support the fix.\n\nThe fix involves modifying the sorting logic to force ALL non-alphabetic characters (except underscore) to sort together, either all before or all after alphabetic characters. This will ensure only one \"Symbols\" section is created, resolving both the duplicate sections and the anchor link issues.\n\nThe locations are well-identified and the fix is straightforward - modify the character classification logic in the sorting functions to group all symbols consistently.",

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/`\n- **Result**: Identified main Sphinx project structure with key directories including `sphinx/builders/` and `sphinx/environment/`\n\n### 2. HTML Builder Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/builders/html/`\n- **Result**: Found main HTML builder file (`__init__.py`) which imports `IndexEntries` from `sphinx.environment.adapters.indexentries`\n\n### 3. Index Generation Logic Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Result**: Located the core `IndexEntries` class responsible for index creation and sorting\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located the relevant code files for index generation\n- Identified the `IndexEntries.create_index()` method as the main entry point\n- Found the sorting logic in the `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115)\n- Discovered Unicode normalization and character classification logic\n\n### 🔍 Key Technical Findings\n1. **Index Sorting Logic**: The `keyfunc()` function (lines 103-115) handles sorting of index entries\n2. **Unicode Handling**: Uses `unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())` for normalization\n3. **Symbol Classification**: Logic at lines 111-112 determines if entries are alphabetic or symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   ```\n4. **Grouping Logic**: The `group_entries` parameter controls entry grouping behavior\n\n### 🚧 Current Investigation Point\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Lines**: 101-150 (sorting and grouping logic)\n- **Status**: Partially analyzed - need to complete reading the file to understand how section headers (\"Symbols\", \"A\", \"B\", etc.) are generated\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete file analysis**: Read remaining lines (151-176) of `indexentries.py` to understand section header generation\n2. **Identify grouping mechanism**: Find where/how entries are grouped into sections like \"Symbols\"\n3. **Locate the bug**: Determine why special characters are creating multiple \"Symbols\" sections\n4. **Test case creation**: Create a minimal test case to reproduce the issue\n5. **Bug fix implementation**: Modify the grouping logic to ensure all non-alphabetic characters are grouped into a single \"Symbols\" section\n\n## Technical Context\n- **Framework**: Sphinx documentation generator\n- **Language**: Python\n- **Issue Type**: Index generation and character classification bug\n- **Affected Component**: HTML builder index output\n- **Root Cause Area**: Likely in the character classification or section grouping logic within `IndexEntries.create_index()`\n\nThe investigation is approximately 60% complete, with the core problematic code area identified but requiring further analysis to pinpoint the exact bug location and implement a fix.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nI found the IndexEntries class which handles index creation.

Lines 168-172 determine the section name:\n   - If it's alphabetic or underscore → return the letter\n   - Otherwise → return \"Symbols\"\n\nHowever, the problem is in the sorting logic in `keyfunc` (lines 103-115). The sorting puts some symbols before alphabetic characters and some after, but the grouping logic in `keyfunc3` treats ALL non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\".\n\nThis creates two separate \"Symbols\" groups:\n1. Symbols that sort before letters (like @)\n2. Symbols that sort after letters (like £, ←)\n\nThe bug is that the sorting and grouping logic are inconsistent. Let me search for how this is used in the HTML builder to understand the complete picture.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"create_index\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/builders/html\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'create_index' in directory (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py\nLines 658-664:\n 658:     def write_genindex(self) -> None:\n 659:         # the total count of lines for each index letter, used to distribute\n 660:         # the entries into two columns\n 661:         genindex = IndexEntries(self.env).create_index(self)\n 662:         indexcounts = []\n 663:         for _k, entries in genindex:\n 664:             indexcounts.append(sum(1 + len(subitems)\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug! The issue is in the sorting logic in the `keyfunc` function (lines 103-115) in `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`.\n\nThe problem:\n1. The sorting logic treats alphabetic characters differently by prepending `chr(127)` to them (lines 111-112)\n2. This means symbols sort in two groups: before alphabetic chars and after alphabetic chars\n3. But the grouping logic in `keyfunc3` (lines 168-172) treats ALL non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\"\n4. This creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections in the final output\n\nThe fix should ensure all symbols are grouped together, regardless of their Unicode sorting position. Let me examine the exact lines that need to be modified.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 103, \"end_line\": 115 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 103-115:\n\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the bug and can identify the exact locations that need to be fixed.\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. The `keyfunc` function (lines 103-115) sorts entries, putting alphabetic characters at the end by prepending `chr(127)`\n2. This causes symbols to be split into two groups: those that naturally sort before letters (like @) and those that sort after letters (like £, ←)\n3. The `keyfunc3` function (lines 158-174) groups all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\", but because of the sorting split, it creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections\n4. Both sections get the same anchor name, causing navigation issues\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe sorting logic needs to be modified so that ALL symbols (non-alphabetic characters) are grouped together, either all at the beginning or all at the end of the index.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 111-112** - Primary sorting logic that causes symbol splitting\n- Current logic: `if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'): lckey = chr(127) + lckey`\n- This puts alphabetic chars at the end, but leaves symbols scattered based on Unicode values\n- Fix: Modify to ensure all symbols sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic entries)\n\n**Location 2: Lines 108-110** - Unicode normalization and RTL handling\n- The normalization and RTL mark removal affects how characters are classified\n- May need adjustment to ensure consistent symbol classification\n\n**Location 3: Lines 167-172** - Section header generation logic in keyfunc3\n- This determines when to create \"Symbols\" vs letter sections\n- The logic is correct but relies on consistent sorting from keyfunc\n\n**Location 4: Lines 153-155** - Similar sorting logic in keyfunc2 for sub-entries\n- Has the same pattern as the main sorting function\n- Needs to be kept consistent with the main fix\n\n**Location 5: Lines 149-155** - The keyfunc2 function for sub-index sorting\n- Contains duplicate logic that should match the main sorting behavior\n- Ensures sub-entries are sorted consistently with main entries\n\nThe core issue is in the sorting logic that splits symbols into two groups, while the grouping logic expects them to be together. The fix should modify the sorting to keep all symbols together.\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Sphinx index generation code, I've identified the root cause of the bug where special characters like @, £, and ← create two separate \"Symbols\" sections instead of being grouped together.\n\nThe issue stems from inconsistent sorting logic that splits symbols into two groups (before and after alphabetic characters) while the grouping logic expects all symbols to be in one section.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 111,\n            \"end_line\": 112\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 108,\n            \"end_line\": 110\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 167,\n            \"end_line\": 172\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 153,\n            \"end_line\": 155\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 149,\n            \"end_line\": 155\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture! The problem is exactly as I analyzed - the sorting logic creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections because some symbols (like @) sort before alphabetic characters while others (like £ and ←) sort after them. Both sections get the same \"Symbols\" name and anchor, causing navigation issues.\n\nThe locator has identified the exact suspicious locations that need to be fixed. Let me provide targeted repair suggestions for each location.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Lines 111-112 (Primary sorting logic)**: Modify the sorting logic to ensure ALL symbols are grouped together by forcing non-alphabetic characters to sort consistently. Change the condition to explicitly handle symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       lckey = chr(1) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures all symbols appear in one group before alphabetic entries, preventing the split.\n\n2. **Lines 108-110 (Unicode normalization)**: The normalization logic is correct but needs to work consistently with the modified sorting. Ensure the RTL mark removal happens before character classification:\n   ```python\n   lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n   if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n       lckey = lckey[1:]\n   ```\n   This supports the primary fix by ensuring consistent character classification.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Section header generation)**: The grouping logic is actually correct - it properly identifies all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\". This works with fixes 1 and 2 to ensure only one \"Symbols\" section is created:\n   ```python\n   letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n   if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n       return letter\n   else:\n       # get all other symbols under one heading\n       return _('Symbols')\n   ```\n   No change needed here - this logic will work correctly once sorting is fixed.\n\n4. **Lines 153-155 (Sub-entry sorting)**: Apply the same symbol sorting logic to sub-entries for consistency:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       key = chr(127) + key\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       key = chr(1) + key\n   ```\n   This ensures sub-entries follow the same sorting pattern as main entries.\n\n5. **Lines 149-155 (keyfunc2 function)**: The entire keyfunc2 function needs the same modification as the main keyfunc to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries. The fix in location 4 addresses this by ensuring the same sorting logic is applied.\n\nThe core solution is to modify the sorting logic to force all symbols to sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic characters) while keeping the existing grouping logic unchanged. This will result in a single \"Symbols\" section with a single anchor, fixing both the duplicate sections and the navigation link issues.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 111-112\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n                lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 108-110\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n            if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n                lckey = lckey[1:]\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 167-172\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n                if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n                    return letter\n                else:\n                    # get all other symbols under one heading\n                    return _('Symbols')\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 153-155\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n                key = chr(127) + key\n            return key\n\n\n[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 149-155\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        def keyfunc2(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n            key = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', entry[0].lower())\n            if key.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n                key = key[1:]\n            if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n                key = chr(127) + key\n            return key\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nLooking at the provided code segments, I can see exactly how the bug manifests:\n\n**Location 1 (lines 111-112)**: This is the core issue. The current logic only adds `chr(127)` to alphabetic characters and underscores, leaving symbols to sort by their natural Unicode values. This causes symbols like @ (ASCII 64) to sort before letters, while symbols like £ (Unicode 163) and ← (Unicode 8592) sort after the `chr(127)` prefix added to letters.\n\n**Location 2 (lines 108-110)**: The Unicode normalization is correct and supports the fix.\n\n**Location 3 (lines 167-172)**: This grouping logic correctly identifies all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\", but because of the sorting split from Location 1, it creates two separate groups both named \"Symbols\".\n\n**Location 4 & 5 (lines 153-155 and 149-155)**: These have the same problematic logic as Location 1 for sub-entries.\n\nThe fix is clear: modify the sorting logic to ensure ALL symbols sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic characters) instead of being split based on their Unicode values.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, these locations are ready for fixing. The root cause is clear:\n\n1. **Primary Issue (Locations 1, 4, 5)**: The sorting logic splits symbols into two groups - those that naturally sort before letters (like @) and those that sort after letters (like £, ←). This happens because only alphabetic characters get the `chr(127)` prefix, leaving symbols to sort by their natural Unicode values.\n\n2. **Secondary Effect (Location 3)**: The grouping logic correctly identifies all symbols as \"Symbols\", but due to the sorting split, it creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections with the same name and anchor.\n\n3. **Supporting Logic (Location 2)**: The Unicode normalization works correctly and will support the fix.\n\nThe fix involves modifying the sorting logic to force ALL non-alphabetic characters (except underscore) to sort together, either all before or all after alphabetic characters. This will ensure only one \"Symbols\" section is created, resolving both the duplicate sections and the anchor link issues.\n\nThe locations are well-identified and the fix is straightforward - modify the character classification logic in the sorting functions to group all symbols consistently.\nUser: [Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 111-112\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import re\n  import unicodedata\n  from itertools import groupby\n  from typing import Any, Dict, Pattern, List, Tuple\n  from typing import cast\n  from sphinx.builders import Builder\n  from sphinx.domains.index import IndexDomain\n  from sphinx.environment import BuildEnvironment\n  from sphinx.errors import NoUri\n  from sphinx.locale import _, __\n  from sphinx.util import split_into, logging\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  101:         #

The problem is exactly as I analyzed - the sorting logic creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections because some symbols (like @) sort before alphabetic characters while others (like £ and ←) sort after them. Both sections get the same \"Symbols\" name and anchor, causing navigation issues.\n\nThe locator has identified the exact suspicious locations that need to be fixed. Let me provide targeted repair suggestions for each location.\n\nS\n\n1. **Lines 111-112 (Primary sorting logic)**: Modify the sorting logic to ensure ALL symbols are grouped together by forcing non-alphabetic characters to sort consistently. Change the condition to explicitly handle symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       lckey = chr(1) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures all symbols appear in one group before alphabetic entries, preventing the split.\n\n2. **Lines 108-110 (Unicode normalization)**: The normalization logic is correct but needs to work consistently with the modified sorting. Ensure the RTL mark removal happens before character classification:\n   ```python\n   lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n   if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n       lckey = lckey[1:]\n   ```\n   This supports the primary fix by ensuring consistent character classification.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Section header generation)**: The grouping logic is actually correct - it properly identifies all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\". This works with fixes 1 and 2 to ensure only one \"Symbols\" section is created:\n   ```python\n   letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n   if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n       return letter\n   else:\n       # get all other symbols under one heading\n       return _('Symbols')\n   ```\n   No change needed here - this logic will work correctly once sorting is fixed.\n\n4. **Lines 153-155 (Sub-entry sorting)**: Apply the same symbol sorting logic to sub-entries for consistency:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       key = chr(127) + key\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       key = chr(1) + key\n   ```\n   This ensures sub-entries follow the same sorting pattern as main entries.\n\n5. **Lines 149-155 (keyfunc2 function)**: The entire keyfunc2 function needs the same modification as the main keyfunc to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries. The fix in location 4 addresses this by ensuring the same sorting logic is applied.\n\nThe core solution is to modify the sorting logic to force all symbols to sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic characters) while keeping the existing grouping logic unchanged. This will result in a single \"Symbols\" section with a single anchor, fixing both the duplicate sections and the navigation link issues.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\n\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that:\n1.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/`\n- **Result**: Identified main Sphinx project structure with key directories including `sphinx/builders/` and `sphinx/environment/`\n\n### 2. HTML Builder Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/builders/html/`\n- **Result**: Found main HTML builder file (`__init__.py`) which imports `IndexEntries` from `sphinx.environment.adapters.indexentries`\n\n### 3. Index Generation Logic Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Result**: Located the core `IndexEntries` class responsible for index creation and sorting\n\n### 4.

Modify sorting logic in `keyfunc` (lines 111-112) to group all symbols\n2. Apply identical fix to `keyfunc2` (lines 153-155) for sub-entries\n3.

Ensure the RTL mark removal happens before character classification:\n   ```python\n   lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n   if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n       lckey = lckey[1:]\n   ```\n   This supports the primary fix by ensuring consistent character classification.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Section header generation)**: The grouping logic is actually correct - it properly identifies all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\". This works with fixes 1 and 2 to ensure only one \"Symbols\" section is created:\n   ```python\n   letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n   if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n       return letter\n   else:\n       # get all other symbols under one heading\n       return _('Symbols')\n   ```\n   No change needed here - this logic will work correctly once sorting is fixed.\n\n4. **Lines 153-155 (Sub-entry sorting)**: Apply the same symbol sorting logic to sub-entries for consistency:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       key = chr(127) + key\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       key = chr(1) + key\n   ```\n   This ensures sub-entries follow the same sorting pattern as main entries.\n\n5. **Lines 149-155 (keyfunc2 function)**: The entire keyfunc2 function needs the same modification as the main keyfunc to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries. The fix in location 4 addresses this by ensuring the same sorting logic is applied.\n\nThe core solution is to modify the sorting logic to force all symbols to sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic characters) while keeping the existing grouping logic unchanged. This will result in a single \"Symbols\" section with a single anchor, fixing both the duplicate sections and the navigation link issues.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 111-112\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n                lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 108-110\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n            if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n                lckey = lckey[1:]\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 167-172\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n                if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n                    return letter\n                else:\n                    # get all other symbols under one heading\n                    return _('Symbols')\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 153-155\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n                key = chr(127) + key\n            return key\n\n\n[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 149-155\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        def keyfunc2(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n            key = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', entry[0].lower())\n            if key.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n                key = key[1:]\n            if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n                key = chr(127) + key\n            return key\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n#REFLECT\nLooking at the provided code segments, I can see exactly how the bug manifests:\n\n**Location 1 (lines 111-112)**: This is the core issue. The current logic only adds `chr(127)` to alphabetic characters and underscores, leaving symbols to sort by their natural Unicode values. This causes symbols like @ (ASCII 64) to sort before letters, while symbols like £ (Unicode 163) and ← (Unicode 8592) sort after the `chr(127)` prefix added to letters.\n\n**Location 2 (lines 108-110)**: The Unicode normalization is correct and supports the fix.\n\n**Location 3 (lines 167-172)**: This grouping logic correctly identifies all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\", but because of the sorting split from Location 1, it creates two separate groups both named \"Symbols\".\n\n**Location 4 & 5 (lines 153-155 and 149-155)**: These have the same problematic logic as Location 1 for sub-entries.\n\nThe fix is clear: modify the sorting logic to ensure ALL symbols sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic characters) instead of being split based on their Unicode values.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, these locations are ready for fixing. The root cause is clear:\n\n1. **Primary Issue (Locations 1, 4, 5)**: The sorting logic splits symbols into two groups - those that naturally sort before letters (like @) and those that sort after letters (like £, ←). This happens because only alphabetic characters get the `chr(127)` prefix, leaving symbols to sort by their natural Unicode values.\n\n2. **Secondary Effect (Location 3)**: The grouping logic correctly identifies all symbols as \"Symbols\", but due to the sorting split, it creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections with the same name and anchor.\n\n3. **Supporting Logic (Location 2)**: The Unicode normalization works correctly and will support the fix.\n\nThe fix involves modifying the sorting logic to force ALL non-alphabetic characters (except underscore) to sort together, either all before or all after alphabetic characters. This will ensure only one \"Symbols\" section is created, resolving both the duplicate sections and the anchor link issues.\n\nThe locations are well-identified and the fix is straightforward - modify the character classification logic in the sorting functions to group all symbols consistently.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 111-112\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import re\n  import unicodedata\n  from itertools import groupby\n  from typing import Any, Dict, Pattern, List, Tuple\n  from typing import cast\n  from sphinx.builders import Builder\n  from sphinx.domains.index import IndexDomain\n  from sphinx.environment import BuildEnvironment\n  from sphinx.errors import NoUri\n  from sphinx.locale import _, __\n  from sphinx.util import split_into, logging\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  101:         #

The problem is exactly as I analyzed - the sorting logic creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections because some symbols (like @) sort before alphabetic characters while others (like £ and ←) sort after them. Both sections get the same \"Symbols\" name and anchor, causing navigation issues.\n\nThe locator has identified the exact suspicious locations that need to be fixed. Let me provide targeted repair suggestions for each location.\n\nS\n\n1. **Lines 111-112 (Primary sorting logic)**: Modify the sorting logic to ensure ALL symbols are grouped together by forcing non-alphabetic characters to sort consistently. Change the condition to explicitly handle symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       lckey = chr(1) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures all symbols appear in one group before alphabetic entries, preventing the split.\n\n2. **Lines 108-110 (Unicode normalization)**: The normalization logic is correct but needs to work consistently with the modified sorting. Ensure the RTL mark removal happens before character classification:\n   ```python\n   lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n   if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n       lckey = lckey[1:]\n   ```\n   This supports the primary fix by ensuring consistent character classification.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Section header generation)**: The grouping logic is actually correct - it properly identifies all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\".

Change the condition to explicitly handle symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       lckey = chr(1) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures all symbols appear in one group before alphabetic entries, preventing the split.\n\n2. **Lines 108-110 (Unicode normalization)**: The normalization logic is correct but needs to work consistently with the modified sorting. Ensure the RTL mark removal happens before character classification:\n   ```python\n   lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n   if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n       lckey = lckey[1:]\n   ```\n   This supports the primary fix by ensuring consistent character classification.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Section header generation)**: The grouping logic is actually correct - it properly identifies all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\". This works with fixes 1 and 2 to ensure only one \"Symbols\" section is created:\n   ```python\n   letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n   if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n       return letter\n   else:\n       # get all other symbols under one heading\n       return _('Symbols')\n   ```\n   No change needed here - this logic will work correctly once sorting is fixed.\n\n4. **Lines 153-155 (Sub-entry sorting)**: Apply the same symbol sorting logic to sub-entries for consistency:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       key = chr(127) + key\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       key = chr(1) + key\n   ```\n   This ensures sub-entries follow the same sorting pattern as main entries.\n\n5. **Lines 149-155 (keyfunc2 function)**: The entire keyfunc2 function needs the same modification as the main keyfunc to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries. The fix in location 4 addresses this by ensuring the same sorting logic is applied.\n\nThe core solution is to modify the sorting logic to force all symbols to sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic characters) while keeping the existing grouping logic unchanged. This will result in a single \"Symbols\" section with a single anchor, fixing both the duplicate sections and the navigation link issues.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

Let me provide targeted repair suggestions for each location.\n\nS\n\n1. **Lines 111-112 (Primary sorting logic)**: Modify the sorting logic to ensure ALL symbols are grouped together by forcing non-alphabetic characters to sort consistently. Change the condition to explicitly handle symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       lckey = chr(1) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures all symbols appear in one group before alphabetic entries, preventing the split.\n\n2. **Lines 108-110 (Unicode normalization)**: The normalization logic is correct but needs to work consistently with the modified sorting. Ensure the RTL mark removal happens before character classification:\n   ```python\n   lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n   if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n       lckey = lckey[1:]\n   ```\n   This supports the primary fix by ensuring consistent character classification.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Section header generation)**: The grouping logic is actually correct - it properly identifies all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\". This works with fixes 1 and 2 to ensure only one \"Symbols\" section is created:\n   ```python\n   letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n   if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n       return letter\n   else:\n       # get all other symbols under one heading\n       return _('Symbols')\n   ```\n   No change needed here - this logic will work correctly once sorting is fixed.\n\n4. **Lines 153-155 (Sub-entry sorting)**: Apply the same symbol sorting logic to sub-entries for consistency:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       key = chr(127) + key\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       key = chr(1) + key\n   ```\n   This ensures sub-entries follow the same sorting pattern as main entries.\n\n5. **Lines 149-155 (keyfunc2 function)**: The entire keyfunc2 function needs the same modification as the main keyfunc to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries. The fix in location 4 addresses this by ensuring the same sorting logic is applied.\n\nThe core solution is to modify the sorting logic to force all symbols to sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic characters) while keeping the existing grouping logic unchanged. This will result in a single \"Symbols\" section with a single anchor, fixing both the duplicate sections and the navigation link issues.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

The problem is exactly as I analyzed - the sorting logic creates two separate \"Symbols\" sections because some symbols (like @) sort before alphabetic characters while others (like £ and ←) sort after them. Both sections get the same \"Symbols\" name and anchor, causing navigation issues.\n\nThe locator has identified the exact suspicious locations that need to be fixed. Let me provide targeted repair suggestions for each location.\n\nS\n\n1. **Lines 111-112 (Primary sorting logic)**: Modify the sorting logic to ensure ALL symbols are grouped together by forcing non-alphabetic characters to sort consistently. Change the condition to explicitly handle symbols:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       lckey = chr(1) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures all symbols appear in one group before alphabetic entries, preventing the split.\n\n2. **Lines 108-110 (Unicode normalization)**: The normalization logic is correct but needs to work consistently with the modified sorting. Ensure the RTL mark removal happens before character classification:\n   ```python\n   lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n   if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n       lckey = lckey[1:]\n   ```\n   This supports the primary fix by ensuring consistent character classification.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Section header generation)**: The grouping logic is actually correct - it properly identifies all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\". This works with fixes 1 and 2 to ensure only one \"Symbols\" section is created:\n   ```python\n   letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n   if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n       return letter\n   else:\n       # get all other symbols under one heading\n       return _('Symbols')\n   ```\n   No change needed here - this logic will work correctly once sorting is fixed.\n\n4. **Lines 153-155 (Sub-entry sorting)**: Apply the same symbol sorting logic to sub-entries for consistency:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       key = chr(127) + key\n   else:\n       # Force all symbols to sort before alphabetic characters\n       key = chr(1) + key\n   ```\n   This ensures sub-entries follow the same sorting pattern as main entries.\n\n5. **Lines 149-155 (keyfunc2 function)**: The entire keyfunc2 function needs the same modification as the main keyfunc to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries. The fix in location 4 addresses this by ensuring the same sorting logic is applied.\n\nThe core solution is to modify the sorting logic to force all symbols to sort together (either all before or all after alphabetic characters) while keeping the existing grouping logic unchanged. This will result in a single \"Symbols\" section with a single anchor, fixing both the duplicate sections and the navigation link issues.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",
