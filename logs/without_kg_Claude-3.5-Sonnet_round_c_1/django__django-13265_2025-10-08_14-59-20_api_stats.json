The issue is with Django migrations where:\n\n1. A model has `order_with_respect_to = 'look'` in its Meta class\n2. There's an index that includes the `_order` field: `models.Index(fields=['look', '_order'])`\n3. The migration operations are in the wrong order - `AddIndex` for `_order` comes before `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`\n4. This causes a crash because `_order` field doesn't exist yet when the index tries to be created\n\nThe `_order` field is automatically created by Django when `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is applied, so the index creation must come after that operation.\n\nI need to explore the Django codebase to understand how migrations are generated and ordered, particularly focusing on the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation and index creation logic.\n\nLet me start by exploring the project structure to understand the Django codebase layout.\n\n#TOOL_CALL explore_directory { \"dir_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nContents of /root/hy/projects_1/django:\n.editorconfig\n.eslintignore\n.eslintrc\n.gitattributes\n.github/\n.gitignore\n.hgignore\n.tx/\nAUTHORS\nCONTRIBUTING.rst\nGruntfile.js\nINSTALL\nLICENSE\nLICENSE.python\nMANIFEST.in\nREADME.rst\ndjango/\ndocs/\nextras/\njs_tests/\npackage.json\nscripts/\nsetup.cfg\nsetup.py\ntests/\ntox.ini\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I understand the Django project structure.

Now I have all the information I need to identify the bug locations. Based on my analysis:\n\n**Problem**: In Django's migration autodetector, when a model has `order_with_respect_to` set and includes the `_order` field in an index definition, the migration operations are generated in the wrong order:\n\n1. `CreateModel` (without `_order` field)\n2. `AddIndex` operations (including one that references `_order`) \n3. `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` (which creates the `_order` field)\n\nThis causes a crash because `AddIndex` tries to create an index on `_order` before the field exists.\n\n**Root Cause**: In `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, the `_detect_changes` method calls:\n- Line 187: `self.generate_added_indexes()` \n- Line 190: `self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()`\n\nThe order needs to be swapped so that `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` comes before `generate_added_indexes()`.\n\n**Solution**: Move line 190 to come before line 187 in the operation generation sequence.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is located in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` in the `_detect_changes` method. Specifically:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 187-190** - The operation generation order needs to be fixed by swapping the order of `generate_added_indexes()` and `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` calls.\n\nThe fix requires moving:\n- Line 190: `self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` \nto come before:\n- Line 187: `self.generate_added_indexes()`\n\nThis ensures that when migrations are generated, the `_order` field is created by the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation before any `AddIndex` operations that reference it are executed, preventing the crash described in the bug report.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django migration bug, the issue is in the operation generation order within the `_detect_changes` method of the migration autodetector. The problem occurs because `generate_added_indexes()` is called before `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()`, causing AddIndex operations to be generated before the `_order` field exists.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 187,\n            \"end_line\": 190\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe fix requires reordering these two method calls so that `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` (line 190) comes before `generate_added_indexes()` (line 187). This ensures that the `_order` field is created by the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation before any AddIndex operations that reference it are executed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAlterOrderWithRespectTo() with ForeignKey crash when _order is included in Index().\nDescription\n\t\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tdb_table = 'look_image'\n\t\torder_with_respect_to = 'look'\n\t\tindexes = [\n\t\t\tmodels.Index(fields=['look', '_order']),\n\t\t\tmodels.Index(fields=['created_at']),\n\t\t\tmodels.Index(fields=['updated_at']),\n\t\t]\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\t\t\tname='LookImage',\n\t\t\tfields=[\n\t\t\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t\t\t('look', models.ForeignKey(on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.CASCADE, related_name='images', to='posts.Look', verbose_name='LOOK')),\n\t\t\t\t('image_url', models.URLField(blank=True, max_length=10000, null=True)),\n\t\t\t\t('image', models.ImageField(max_length=2000, upload_to='')),\n\t\t\t\t('deleted', models.DateTimeField(editable=False, null=True)),\n\t\t\t\t('created_at', models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)),\n\t\t\t\t('updated_at', models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)),\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t),\n\t\tmigrations.AddIndex(\n\t\t\tmodel_name='lookimage',\n\t\t\tindex=models.Index(fields=['look', '_order'], name='look_image_look_id_eaff30_idx'),\n\t\t),\n\t\tmigrations.AddIndex(\n\t\t\tmodel_name='lookimage',\n\t\t\tindex=models.Index(fields=['created_at'], name='look_image_created_f746cf_idx'),\n\t\t),\n\t\tmigrations.AddIndex(\n\t\t\tmodel_name='lookimage',\n\t\t\tindex=models.Index(fields=['updated_at'], name='look_image_updated_aceaf9_idx'),\n\t\t),\n\t\tmigrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo(\n\t\t\tname='lookimage',\n\t\t\torder_with_respect_to='look',\n\t\t),\nI added orders_with_respect_to in new model class's Meta class and also made index for '_order' field by combining with other field.

So when an index references the `_order` field, it tries to create an index on a field that doesn't exist yet.\n\nThe fix is simple: we need to swap the order of these two operations so that `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` comes before `generate_added_indexes()`.\n\nLet me examine the specific lines that need to be changed:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\", \"start_line\": 185, \"end_line\": 195 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\nTotal lines: 1317\nShowing lines 185-195:\n\n 185:         self.generate_altered_unique_together()\n 186:         self.generate_altered_index_together()\n 187:         self.generate_added_indexes()\n 188:         self.generate_added_constraints()\n 189:         self.generate_altered_db_table()\n 190:         self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()\n 191: \n 192:         self._sort_migrations()\n 193:         self._build_migration_list(graph)\n 194:         self._optimize_migrations()\n 195: \n\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have all the information I need to identify the bug locations. Based on my analysis:\n\n**Problem**: In Django's migration autodetector, when a model has `order_with_respect_to` set and includes the `_order` field in an index definition, the migration operations are generated in the wrong order:\n\n1. `CreateModel` (without `_order` field)\n2. `AddIndex` operations (including one that references `_order`) \n3. `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` (which creates the `_order` field)\n\nThis causes a crash because `AddIndex` tries to create an index on `_order` before the field exists.\n\n**Root Cause**: In `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, the `_detect_changes` method calls:\n- Line 187: `self.generate_added_indexes()` \n- Line 190: `self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()`\n\nThe order needs to be swapped so that `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` comes before `generate_added_indexes()`.\n\n**Solution**: Move line 190 to come before line 187 in the operation generation sequence.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is located in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` in the `_detect_changes` method. Specifically:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 187-190** - The operation generation order needs to be fixed by swapping the order of `generate_added_indexes()` and `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` calls.\n\nThe fix requires moving:\n- Line 190: `self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` \nto come before:\n- Line 187: `self.generate_added_indexes()`\n\nThis ensures that when migrations are generated, the `_order` field is created by the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation before any `AddIndex` operations that reference it are executed, preventing the crash described in the bug report.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django migration bug, the issue is in the operation generation order within the `_detect_changes` method of the migration autodetector. The problem occurs because `generate_added_indexes()` is called before `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()`, causing AddIndex operations to be generated before the `_order` field exists.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 187,\n            \"end_line\": 190\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe fix requires reordering these two method calls so that `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` (line 190) comes before `generate_added_indexes()` (line 187). This ensures that the `_order` field is created by the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation before any AddIndex operations that reference it are executed.\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete picture. The user has provided the exact problem statement and the generated migration operations that demonstrate the bug. The issue is clear:\n\n1. `CreateModel` creates the model without the `_order` field\n2. `AddIndex` operations are generated, including one that references `_order` field\n3. `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is generated last, which would create the `_order` field\n\nBut the `AddIndex` operation that references `_order` fails because the field doesn't exist yet. The `_order` field is only created when `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is applied.\n\nThe fix is exactly what I identified: move `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` to come before `generate_added_indexes()` in the operation generation sequence.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django migration autodetector bug, here are the repair suggestions:\n\n**Bug Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, lines 187-190\n\n**Root Cause**: The migration operations are generated in the wrong order. When a model has `order_with_respect_to` set and includes the `_order` field in an index definition, the autodetector generates:\n1. `CreateModel` (without `_order` field)  \n2. `AddIndex` operations (including ones referencing `_order`)\n3. `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` (which creates the `_order` field)\n\nThis causes `AddIndex` to fail because it tries to create an index on `_order` before the field exists.\n\n**Repair Suggestion**:\n\n1. **Lines 187-190**: Reorder the operation generation sequence by moving `self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` (currently line 190) to come before `self.generate_added_indexes()` (currently line 187).\n\n   **Current order**:\n   ```python\n   self.generate_altered_index_together()\n   self.generate_added_indexes()           # Line 187\n   self.generate_added_constraints()\n   self.generate_altered_db_table()\n   self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()  # Line 190\n   ```\n\n   **Fixed order**:\n   ```python\n   self.generate_altered_index_together()\n   self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()  # Move this up\n   self.generate_added_indexes()                   # Now comes after\n   self.generate_added_constraints()\n   self.generate_altered_db_table()\n   ```\n\nThis ensures that the `_order` field is created by the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation before any `AddIndex` operations that reference it are executed, preventing the crash described in the problem statement.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py lines 187-190\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        self.generate_added_indexes()\n        self.generate_added_constraints()\n        self.generate_altered_db_table()\n        self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAlterOrderWithRespectTo() with ForeignKey crash when _order is included in Index().\nDescription\n\t\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tdb_table = 'look_image'\n\t\torder_with_respect_to = 'look'\n\t\tindexes = [\n\t\t\tmodels.Index(fields=['look', '_order']),\n\t\t\tmodels.Index(fields=['created_at']),\n\t\t\tmodels.Index(fields=['updated_at']),\n\t\t]\nmigrations.CreateModel(\n\t\t\tname='LookImage',\n\t\t\tfields=[\n\t\t\t\t('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),\n\t\t\t\t('look', models.ForeignKey(on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.CASCADE, related_name='images', to='posts.Look', verbose_name='LOOK')),\n\t\t\t\t('image_url', models.URLField(blank=True, max_length=10000, null=True)),\n\t\t\t\t('image', models.ImageField(max_length=2000, upload_to='')),\n\t\t\t\t('deleted', models.DateTimeField(editable=False, null=True)),\n\t\t\t\t('created_at', models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)),\n\t\t\t\t('updated_at', models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)),\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t),\n\t\tmigrations.AddIndex(\n\t\t\tmodel_name='lookimage',\n\t\t\tindex=models.Index(fields=['look', '_order'], name='look_image_look_id_eaff30_idx'),\n\t\t),\n\t\tmigrations.AddIndex(\n\t\t\tmodel_name='lookimage',\n\t\t\tindex=models.Index(fields=['created_at'], name='look_image_created_f746cf_idx'),\n\t\t),\n\t\tmigrations.AddIndex(\n\t\t\tmodel_name='lookimage',\n\t\t\tindex=models.Index(fields=['updated_at'], name='look_image_updated_aceaf9_idx'),\n\t\t),\n\t\tmigrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo(\n\t\t\tname='lookimage',\n\t\t\torder_with_respect_to='look',\n\t\t),\nI added orders_with_respect_to in new model class's Meta class and also made index for '_order' field by combining with other field.

Now I have all the information I need to identify the bug locations. Based on my analysis:\n\n**Problem**: In Django's migration autodetector, when a model has `order_with_respect_to` set and includes the `_order` field in an index definition, the migration operations are generated in the wrong order:\n\n1. `CreateModel` (without `_order` field)\n2. `AddIndex` operations (including one that references `_order`) \n3. `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` (which creates the `_order` field)\n\nThis causes a crash because `AddIndex` tries to create an index on `_order` before the field exists.\n\n**Root Cause**: In `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, the `_detect_changes` method calls:\n- Line 187: `self.generate_added_indexes()` \n- Line 190: `self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()`\n\nThe order needs to be swapped so that `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` comes before `generate_added_indexes()`.\n\n**Solution**: Move line 190 to come before line 187 in the operation generation sequence.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is located in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` in the `_detect_changes` method. Specifically:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 187-190** - The operation generation order needs to be fixed by swapping the order of `generate_added_indexes()` and `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` calls.\n\nThe fix requires moving:\n- Line 190: `self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` \nto come before:\n- Line 187: `self.generate_added_indexes()`\n\nThis ensures that when migrations are generated, the `_order` field is created by the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation before any `AddIndex` operations that reference it are executed, preventing the crash described in the bug report.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django migration bug, the issue is in the operation generation order within the `_detect_changes` method of the migration autodetector. The problem occurs because `generate_added_indexes()` is called before `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()`, causing AddIndex operations to be generated before the `_order` field exists.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 187,\n            \"end_line\": 190\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe fix requires reordering these two method calls so that `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` (line 190) comes before `generate_added_indexes()` (line 187). This ensures that the `_order` field is created by the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation before any AddIndex operations that reference it are executed.\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete picture. The user has provided the exact problem statement and the generated migration operations that demonstrate the bug.

Line 190: `self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` - This generates the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation that creates the `_order` field\n\nThe problem is that the AddIndex operation for `_order` is generated before the field exists.
