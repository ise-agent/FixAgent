    "response": "# Summary: Flask Blueprint Name Validation Bug Fix\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the Flask project related to blueprint names containing dots. The issue is that Flask should raise an error when a blueprint name contains a dot because dots are now significant for nested blueprints, but this validation is missing (though it was already added for endpoint names in version 1.0).\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Successfully identified the Flask project structure at `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the main Flask source code in `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/` with `blueprints.py` as the target file\n\n### 2. Blueprint Implementation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Result**: Found the `Blueprint` class definition starting at line 108 in `blueprints.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the Blueprint constructor (`__init__` method) at lines 171-202\n\n### 3. Current Blueprint Name Handling\n- **Discovery**: At line 191, the blueprint name is simply assigned without validation: `self.name = name`\n- **Issue Confirmed**: No validation exists for dots in blueprint names\n\n### 4. Existing Validation Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"dot\" keyword\n- **Critical Finding**: Found existing dot validation for endpoints at lines 364 and 367-368 in `blueprints.py`:\n  ```python\n  assert \".\" not in endpoint, \"Blueprint endpoints should not contain dots\"\n  assert \".\" not in view_func.__name__, \"Blueprint view function name should not contain dots\"\n  ```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Located the bug - missing validation in Blueprint.__init__()\n- ✅ **Completed**: Found the exact location where fix should be applied (line 191 in blueprints.py)\n- ✅ **Completed**: Identified the validation pattern used for similar cases\n- 🔄 **Next Step**: Implement the fix by adding dot validation for blueprint names\n\n## Technical Details and Implementation Plan\n\n### Bug Location\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py`\n- **Method**: `Blueprint.__init__()` (lines 171-202)\n- **Specific Line**: Line 191 where `self.name = name` is assigned\n\n### Validation Pattern to Follow\nBased on existing endpoint validation, the fix should add an assertion similar to:\n```python\nassert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\n```\n\n### Recommended Implementation\nAdd the validation right before or after line 191 in the Blueprint constructor to ensure blueprint names don't contain dots, following the same pattern used for endpoint validation.\n\n## Tools Used\n1. **explore_directory**: For project structure navigation\n2. **read_file_lines**: For examining specific code sections\n3. **search_code_with_context**: For finding existing validation patterns\n\n## Next Actions Required\n1. Implement the dot validation in Blueprint.__init__()\n2. Test the fix to ensure it properly raises an error for blueprint names containing dots\n3. Verify the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n4. Consider adding appropriate error message consistent with existing validation messages",

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Successfully identified the Flask project structure at `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the main Flask source code in `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/` with `blueprints.py` as the target file\n\n### 2. Blueprint Implementation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Result**: Found the `Blueprint` class definition starting at line 108 in `blueprints.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the Blueprint constructor (`__init__` method) at lines 171-202\n\n### 3. Current Blueprint Name Handling\n- **Discovery**: At line 191, the blueprint name is simply assigned without validation: `self.name = name`\n- **Issue Confirmed**: No validation exists for dots in blueprint names\n\n### 4. Existing Validation Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"dot\" keyword\n- **Critical Finding**: Found existing dot validation for endpoints at lines 364 and 367-368 in `blueprints.py`:\n  ```python\n  assert \".\" not in endpoint, \"Blueprint endpoints should not contain dots\"\n  assert \".\" not in view_func.__name__, \"Blueprint view function name should not contain dots\"\n  ```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Located the bug - missing validation in Blueprint.__init__()\n- ✅ **Completed**: Found the exact location where fix should be applied (line 191 in blueprints.py)\n- ✅ **Completed**: Identified the validation pattern used for similar cases\n- 🔄 **Next Step**: Implement the fix by adding dot validation for blueprint names\n\n## Technical Details and Implementation Plan\n\n### Bug Location\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py`\n- **Method**: `Blueprint.__init__()` (lines 171-202)\n- **Specific Line**: Line 191 where `self.name = name` is assigned\n\n### Validation Pattern to Follow\nBased on existing endpoint validation, the fix should add an assertion similar to:\n```python\nassert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\n```\n\n### Recommended Implementation\nAdd the validation right before or after line 191 in the Blueprint constructor to ensure blueprint names don't contain dots, following the same pattern used for endpoint validation.\n\n## Tools Used\n1. **explore_directory**: For project structure navigation\n2. **read_file_lines**: For examining specific code sections\n3. **search_code_with_context**: For finding existing validation patterns\n\n## Next Actions Required\n1. Implement the dot validation in Blueprint.__init__()\n2. Test the fix to ensure it properly raises an error for blueprint names containing dots\n3. Verify the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n4. Consider adding appropriate error message consistent with existing validation messages\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI can see the Blueprint class documentation, but I need to find the actual __init__ method to see how the name parameter is currently handled. The documentation mentions that the name will be prepended to each endpoint name, which confirms this is where the validation should be added.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Summary: Flask Blueprint Name Validation Bug Fix\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the Flask project related to blueprint names containing dots. The issue is that Flask should raise an error when a blueprint name contains a dot because dots are now significant for nested blueprints, but this validation is missing (though it was already added for endpoint names in version 1.0).\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Successfully identified the Flask project structure at `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the main Flask source code in `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/` with `blueprints.py` as the target file\n\n### 2. Blueprint Implementation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Result**: Found the `Blueprint` class definition starting at line 108 in `blueprints.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the Blueprint constructor (`__init__` method) at lines 171-202\n\n### 3. Current Blueprint Name Handling\n- **Discovery**: At line 191, the blueprint name is simply assigned without validation: `self.name = name`\n- **Issue Confirmed**: No validation exists for dots in blueprint names\n\n### 4. Existing Validation Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"dot\" keyword\n- **Critical Finding**: Found existing dot validation for endpoints at lines 364 and 367-368 in `blueprints.py`:\n  ```python\n  assert \".\" not in endpoint, \"Blueprint endpoints should not contain dots\"\n  assert \".\" not in view_func.__name__, \"Blueprint view function name should not contain dots\"\n  ```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Located the bug - missing validation in Blueprint.__init__()\n- ✅ **Completed**: Found the exact location where fix should be applied (line 191 in blueprints.py)\n- ✅ **Completed**: Identified the validation pattern used for similar cases\n- 🔄 **Next Step**: Implement the fix by adding dot validation for blueprint names\n\n## Technical Details and Implementation Plan\n\n### Bug Location\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py`\n- **Method**: `Blueprint.__init__()` (lines 171-202)\n- **Specific Line**: Line 191 where `self.name = name` is assigned\n\n### Validation Pattern to Follow\nBased on existing endpoint validation, the fix should add an assertion similar to:\n```python\nassert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\n```\n\n### Recommended Implementation\nAdd the validation right before or after line 191 in the Blueprint constructor to ensure blueprint names don't contain dots, following the same pattern used for endpoint validation.\n\n## Tools Used\n1. **explore_directory**: For project structure navigation\n2. **read_file_lines**: For examining specific code sections\n3. **search_code_with_context**: For finding existing validation patterns\n\n## Next Actions Required\n1. Implement the dot validation in Blueprint.__init__()\n2. Test the fix to ensure it properly raises an error for blueprint names containing dots\n3. Verify the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n4. Consider adding appropriate error message consistent with existing validation messages\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\nStart line: 191\nEnd line: 191\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI can see the Blueprint class documentation, but I need to find the actual __init__ method to see how the name parameter is currently handled. The documentation mentions that the name will be prepended to each endpoint name, which confirms this is where the validation should be added. Let me continue reading to find the constructor.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\", \"start_line\": 158, \"end_line\": 210 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\nTotal lines: 542\nShowing lines 158-207:\n\n 158:     .. versionadded:: 0.7\n 159:     \"\"\"\n 160: \n 161:     warn_on_modifications = False\n 162:     _got_registered_once = False\n 163: \n 164:     #: Blueprint local JSON encoder class to use.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Summary: Flask Blueprint Name Validation Bug Fix\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the Flask project related to blueprint names containing dots. The issue is that Flask should raise an error when a blueprint name contains a dot because dots are now significant for nested blueprints, but this validation is missing (though it was already added for endpoint names in version 1.0).\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Successfully identified the Flask project structure at `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the main Flask source code in `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/` with `blueprints.py` as the target file\n\n### 2. Blueprint Implementation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Result**: Found the `Blueprint` class definition starting at line 108 in `blueprints.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the Blueprint constructor (`__init__` method) at lines 171-202\n\n### 3. Current Blueprint Name Handling\n- **Discovery**: At line 191, the blueprint name is simply assigned without validation: `self.name = name`\n- **Issue Confirmed**: No validation exists for dots in blueprint names\n\n### 4. Existing Validation Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"dot\" keyword\n- **Critical Finding**: Found existing dot validation for endpoints at lines 364 and 367-368 in `blueprints.py`:\n  ```python\n  assert \".\" not in endpoint, \"Blueprint endpoints should not contain dots\"\n  assert \".\" not in view_func.__name__, \"Blueprint view function name should not contain dots\"\n  ```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Located the bug - missing validation in Blueprint.__init__()\n- ✅ **Completed**: Found the exact location where fix should be applied (line 191 in blueprints.py)\n- ✅ **Completed**: Identified the validation pattern used for similar cases\n- 🔄 **Next Step**: Implement the fix by adding dot validation for blueprint names\n\n## Technical Details and Implementation Plan\n\n### Bug Location\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py`\n- **Method**: `Blueprint.__init__()` (lines 171-202)\n- **Specific Line**: Line 191 where `self.name = name` is assigned\n\n### Validation Pattern to Follow\nBased on existing endpoint validation, the fix should add an assertion similar to:\n```python\nassert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\n```\n\n### Recommended Implementation\nAdd the validation right before or after line 191 in the Blueprint constructor to ensure blueprint names don't contain dots, following the same pattern used for endpoint validation.\n\n## Tools Used\n1. **explore_directory**: For project structure navigation\n2. **read_file_lines**: For examining specific code sections\n3. **search_code_with_context**: For finding existing validation patterns\n\n## Next Actions Required\n1. Implement the dot validation in Blueprint.__init__()\n2. Test the fix to ensure it properly raises an error for blueprint names containing dots\n3. Verify the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n4. Consider adding appropriate error message consistent with existing validation messages\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\nStart line: 191\nEnd line: 191\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nI have thoroughly analyzed the Flask blueprint implementation and identified the exact bug location. The problem is clear: Flask should raise an error when a blueprint name contains a dot because dots are significant for nested blueprints, but this validation is missing from the Blueprint constructor.\n\nI found:\n1. The bug location at line 191 where `self.name = name` is assigned without validation\n2. The existing validation pattern for endpoints at lines 364 and 367-368 that should be replicated\n3. The exact fix needed: add dot validation for blueprint names in the constructor\n\nS\n\n1. **Line 191 in `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py`**: Add validation to check that blueprint names do not contain dots. Insert an assertion right before the `self.name = name` assignment:\n   ```python\n   assert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\n   self.name = name\n   ```\n   This follows the exact same pattern used for endpoint validation at lines 364 and 367-368, ensuring consistency with the existing codebase. The validation prevents blueprint names from containing dots, which is necessary since dots are now significant for nested blueprint functionality.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI can see the Blueprint class documentation, but I need to find the actual __init__ method to see how the name parameter is currently handled. The documentation mentions that the name will be prepended to each endpoint name, which confirms this is where the validation should be added. Let me continue reading to find the constructor.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\", \"start_line\": 158, \"end_line\": 210 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\nTotal lines: 542\nShowing lines 158-207:\n\n 158:     .. versionadded:: 0.7\n 159:     \"\"\"\n 160: \n 161:     warn_on_modifications = False\n 162:     _got_registered_once = False\n 163: \n 164:     #: Blueprint local JSON encoder class to use.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Summary: Flask Blueprint Name Validation Bug Fix\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the Flask project related to blueprint names containing dots. The issue is that Flask should raise an error when a blueprint name contains a dot because dots are now significant for nested blueprints, but this validation is missing (though it was already added for endpoint names in version 1.0).\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Successfully identified the Flask project structure at `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the main Flask source code in `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/` with `blueprints.py` as the target file\n\n### 2. Blueprint Implementation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Result**: Found the `Blueprint` class definition starting at line 108 in `blueprints.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the Blueprint constructor (`__init__` method) at lines 171-202\n\n### 3. Current Blueprint Name Handling\n- **Discovery**: At line 191, the blueprint name is simply assigned without validation: `self.name = name`\n- **Issue Confirmed**: No validation exists for dots in blueprint names\n\n### 4. Existing Validation Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"dot\" keyword\n- **Critical Finding**: Found existing dot validation for endpoints at lines 364 and 367-368 in `blueprints.py`:\n  ```python\n  assert \".\" not in endpoint, \"Blueprint endpoints should not contain dots\"\n  assert \".\" not in view_func.__name__, \"Blueprint view function name should not contain dots\"\n  ```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Located the bug - missing validation in Blueprint.__init__()\n- ✅ **Completed**: Found the exact location where fix should be applied (line 191 in blueprints.py)\n- ✅ **Completed**: Identified the validation pattern used for similar cases\n- 🔄 **Next Step**: Implement the fix by adding dot validation for blueprint names\n\n## Technical Details and Implementation Plan\n\n### Bug Location\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py`\n- **Method**: `Blueprint.__init__()` (lines 171-202)\n- **Specific Line**: Line 191 where `self.name = name` is assigned\n\n### Validation Pattern to Follow\nBased on existing endpoint validation, the fix should add an assertion similar to:\n```python\nassert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\n```\n\n### Recommended Implementation\nAdd the validation right before or after line 191 in the Blueprint constructor to ensure blueprint names don't contain dots, following the same pattern used for endpoint validation.\n\n## Tools Used\n1. **explore_directory**: For project structure navigation\n2. **read_file_lines**: For examining specific code sections\n3. **search_code_with_context**: For finding existing validation patterns\n\n## Next Actions Required\n1. Implement the dot validation in Blueprint.__init__()\n2. Test the fix to ensure it properly raises an error for blueprint names containing dots\n3. Verify the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n4. Consider adding appropriate error message consistent with existing validation messages\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\nStart line: 191\nEnd line: 191\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nI have thoroughly analyzed the Flask blueprint implementation and identified the exact bug location. The problem is clear: Flask should raise an error when a blueprint name contains a dot because dots are significant for nested blueprints, but this validation is missing from the Blueprint constructor.\n\nI found:\n1. The bug location at line 191 where `self.name = name` is assigned without validation\n2. The existing validation pattern for endpoints at lines 364 and 367-368 that should be replicated\n3.

The documentation mentions that the name will be prepended to each endpoint name, which confirms this is where the validation should be added.

At lines 364 and 367-368, there are assertions that check for dots in endpoint names and view function names:\n\n```python\nassert \".\" not in endpoint, \"Blueprint endpoints should not contain dots\"\nassert \".\" not in view_func.__name__, \"Blueprint view function name should not contain dots\"\n```\n\nNow I have all the information I need to identify the bug location and fix:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: Line 191 in `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py` where `self.name = name` is assigned without validation\n2. **Fix Pattern**: Add a similar assertion to validate that blueprint names don't contain dots\n3. **Existing Validation**: Lines 364 and 367-368 show the exact pattern to follow\n\nThe bug is that Flask should raise an error when a blueprint name contains a dot (since dots are significant for nested blueprints), but this validation is missing from the Blueprint constructor.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Analysis Summary\n\n**Root Cause**: Missing validation for dots in blueprint names in the Blueprint constructor.\n\n**Locations to Fix**:\n\n1. **Line 191** in `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py` - Add dot validation before or after the `self.name = name` assignment in the Blueprint `__init__` method.\n\n**Fix Implementation**: Add an assertion similar to the existing endpoint validation pattern:\n```python\nassert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\n```\n\nThis should be added right before or after line 191 where `self.name = name` is assigned, following the same validation pattern already established for endpoint names at lines 364 and 367-368.\n\nThe fix ensures that blueprint names cannot contain dots, which is necessary since dots are now significant for nested blueprints functionality.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Flask blueprint implementation, I have identified the root cause of the bug. The issue is that Flask should raise an error when a blueprint name contains a dot (since dots are now significant for nested blueprints), but this validation is missing from the Blueprint constructor.\n\nI found that:\n1. The Blueprint class constructor at line 191 simply assigns `self.name = name` without any validation\n2. There's already a validation pattern established for endpoint names at lines 364 and 367-368 that checks for dots\n3. The same validation logic needs to be applied to blueprint names\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 191,\n            \"end_line\": 191\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nI have thoroughly analyzed the Flask blueprint implementation and identified the exact bug location. The problem is clear: Flask should raise an error when a blueprint name contains a dot because dots are significant for nested blueprints, but this validation is missing from the Blueprint constructor.\n\nI found:\n1. The bug location at line 191 where `self.name = name` is assigned without validation\n2. The existing validation pattern for endpoints at lines 364 and 367-368 that should be replicated\n3. The exact fix needed: add dot validation for blueprint names in the constructor\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Line 191 in `/root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py`**: Add validation to check that blueprint names do not contain dots. Insert an assertion right before the `self.name = name` assignment:\n   ```python\n   assert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\n   self.name = name\n   ```\n   This follows the exact same pattern used for endpoint validation at lines 364 and 367-368, ensuring consistency with the existing codebase. The validation prevents blueprint names from containing dots, which is necessary since dots are now significant for nested blueprint functionality.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py lines 191-191\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        self.name = name\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n#REFLECT\nLooking at the provided code segment, I can see line 191 where `self.name = name` is assigned without any validation. Based on my earlier analysis, I found that:\n\n1. This is indeed the exact location where the bug exists - blueprint names are assigned without dot validation\n2. There's already an established pattern for dot validation in the same file (lines 364 and 367-368) for endpoints\n3. The fix is straightforward - add an assertion before the assignment following the existing pattern\n4. The problem statement confirms this is about raising an error when blueprint names contain dots, which matches exactly what needs to be implemented\n\nThe location is clearly identified and the fix is well-defined based on the existing validation pattern in the codebase.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, this location is ready for fixing. The code segment shows exactly where the blueprint name is assigned (`self.name = name`) without any validation for dots. Based on my analysis, I found the existing validation pattern for endpoints at lines 364 and 367-368 in the same file, which uses assertions like `assert \".\" not in endpoint, \"Blueprint endpoints should not contain dots\"`. \n\nThe fix is straightforward: add a similar assertion right before line 191 to validate that the blueprint name doesn't contain dots, following the established pattern in the codebase. This will ensure consistency with the existing endpoint validation and properly raise an error when blueprint names contain dots, as required for nested blueprint functionality.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py lines 191-191\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import typing as t\n  from collections import defaultdict\n  from functools import update_wrapper\n  from .scaffold import _endpoint_from_view_func\n  from .scaffold import _sentinel\n  from .scaffold import Scaffold\n  from .typing import AfterRequestCallable\n  from .typing import BeforeRequestCallable\n  from .typing import ErrorHandlerCallable\n  from .typing import TeardownCallable\n  from .typing import TemplateContextProcessorCallable\n  from .typing import TemplateFilterCallable\n  from .typing import TemplateGlobalCallable\n  from .typing import TemplateTestCallable\n  from .typing import URLDefaultCallable\n  from .typing import URLValuePreprocessorCallable\n  from .app import Flask\n  from warnings import warn\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  181:         root_path: t.Optional[str] = None,\n[C]  182:         cli_group: t.Optional[str] = _sentinel,  # type: ignore\n[C]  183:     ):\n[C]  184:         super().__init__(\n[C]  185:             import_name=import_name,\n[C]  186:             static_folder=static_folder,\n[C]  187:             static_url_path=static_url_path,\n[C]  188:             template_folder=template_folder,\n[C]  189:             root_path=root_path,\n[C]  190:         )\n[R]  191:         self.name = name\n[C]  192:         self.url_prefix = url_prefix\n[C]  193:         self.subdomain = subdomain\n[C]  194:         self.deferred_functions: t.List[DeferredSetupFunction] = []\n[C]  195: \n[C]  196:         if url_defaults is None:\n[C]  197:             url_defaults = {}\n[C]  198: \n[C]  199:         self.url_values_defaults = url_defaults\n[C]  200:         self.cli_group = cli_group\n[C]  201:         self._blueprints: t.List[t.Tuple[\"Blueprint\", dict]] = []\n\nYou must pay close attention to **indentation** — especially the relative indentation level between the patch and its parent scope (for example, the containing class or function).\n⚠️ **Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n⚠️ **Do not combine fixes for different locations into one block** — every location's fix should be in a **separate** ```python```code block.\n\nHere are the suggestions from the Suggester:\n#REFLECT\nI have thoroughly analyzed the Flask blueprint implementation and identified the exact bug location.
