Looking at the problem description, there's a clear bug:\n\n1. When `bug.subs(a, 1).apart(t)` is called, it correctly returns `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n2. But when `bug.apart(t)` is called (without substituting `a=1` first), it incorrectly returns `-a*t`\n\nThe issue seems to be that when the expression contains symbolic coefficients (like `a`), the `apart` function is not properly handling the partial fraction decomposition.

    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug better. Looking at the `apart` function implementation, I can see the issue:\n\n1. The expression `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` should simplify to something that can be decomposed into partial fractions\n2. When `a=1` is substituted first, it works correctly: `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n3. But when `apart(t)` is called directly on the expression with symbolic `a`, it incorrectly returns `-a*t`\n\nThe problem seems to be in how the function handles multivariate expressions (expressions with both `a` and `t`). Let me examine the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function since that's what gets called when `full=False` (the default).\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", \"start_line\": 152, \"end_line\": 190 }",

Looking at the `apart` function implementation, I can see the issue:\n\n1. The expression `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` should simplify to something that can be decomposed into partial fractions\n2. When `a=1` is substituted first, it works correctly: `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n3. But when `apart(t)` is called directly on the expression with symbolic `a`, it incorrectly returns `-a*t`\n\nThe problem seems to be in how the function handles multivariate expressions (expressions with both `a` and `t`). Let me examine the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function since that's what gets called when `full=False` (the default).\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", \"start_line\": 152, \"end_line\": 190 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\nTotal lines: 498\nShowing lines 152-190:\n\n 152: def apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q):\n 153:     \"\"\"Partial fractions via method of undetermined coefficients. \"\"\"\n 154:     X = numbered_symbols(cls=Dummy)\n 155:     partial, symbols = [], []\n 156: \n 157:     _, factors = Q.factor_list()\n 158: \n 159:     for f, k in factors:\n 160:         n, q = f.degree(), Q\n 161: \n 162:         for i in range(1, k + 1):\n 163:             coeffs, q = take(X, n), q.quo(f)\n 164:             partial.append((coeffs, q, f, i))\n 165:             symbols.extend(coeffs)\n 166: \n 167:     dom = Q.get_domain().inject(*symbols)\n 168:     F = Poly(0, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 169: \n 170:     for i, (coeffs, q, f, k) in enumerate(partial):\n 171:         h = Poly(coeffs, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 172:         partial[i] = (h, f, k)\n 173:         q = q.set_domain(dom)\n 174:         F += h*q\n 175: \n 176:     system, result = [], S(0)\n 177: \n 178:     for (k,), coeff in F.terms():\n 179:         system.append(coeff - P.nth(k))\n 180: \n 181:     from sympy.solvers import solve\n 182:     solution = solve(system, symbols)\n 183: \n 184:     for h, f, k in partial:\n 185:         h = h.as_expr().subs(solution)\n 186:         result += h/f.as_expr()**k\n 187: \n 188:     return result\n 189: \n 190: \n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1.

The `apart` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py` is responsible for partial fraction decomposition\n2. When the expression contains multiple variables (like `a` and `t`), the function checks if `P.is_multivariate` at line 120\n3. If it's multivariate, it tries to cancel the expression first (line 121-123), but if that doesn't help, it raises a `NotImplementedError` for \"multivariate partial fraction decomposition\" (line 125-126)\n\nHowever, the bug shows that instead of raising an error, it's returning `-a*t`, which suggests the cancellation or some other part of the logic is incorrectly simplifying the expression.\n\nLet me check what happens during the polynomial conversion step and see if there's an issue with how multivariate expressions are handled.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"parallel_poly_from_expr\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys\" }",

Looking at the `apart` function implementation, I can see the issue:\n\n1. The expression `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` should simplify to something that can be decomposed into partial fractions\n2. When `a=1` is substituted first, it works correctly: `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n3. But when `apart(t)` is called directly on the expression with symbolic `a`, it incorrectly returns `-a*t`\n\nThe problem seems to be in how the function handles multivariate expressions (expressions with both `a` and `t`). Let me examine the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function since that's what gets called when `full=False` (the default).\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", \"start_line\": 152, \"end_line\": 190 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\nTotal lines: 498\nShowing lines 152-190:\n\n 152: def apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q):\n 153:     \"\"\"Partial fractions via method of undetermined coefficients. \"\"\"\n 154:     X = numbered_symbols(cls=Dummy)\n 155:     partial, symbols = [], []\n 156: \n 157:     _, factors = Q.factor_list()\n 158: \n 159:     for f, k in factors:\n 160:         n, q = f.degree(), Q\n 161: \n 162:         for i in range(1, k + 1):\n 163:             coeffs, q = take(X, n), q.quo(f)\n 164:             partial.append((coeffs, q, f, i))\n 165:             symbols.extend(coeffs)\n 166: \n 167:     dom = Q.get_domain().inject(*symbols)\n 168:     F = Poly(0, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 169: \n 170:     for i, (coeffs, q, f, k) in enumerate(partial):\n 171:         h = Poly(coeffs, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 172:         partial[i] = (h, f, k)\n 173:         q = q.set_domain(dom)\n 174:         F += h*q\n 175: \n 176:     system, result = [], S(0)\n 177: \n 178:     for (k,), coeff in F.terms():\n 179:         system.append(coeff - P.nth(k))\n 180: \n 181:     from sympy.solvers import solve\n 182:     solution = solve(system, symbols)\n 183: \n 184:     for h, f, k in partial:\n 185:         h = h.as_expr().subs(solution)\n 186:         result += h/f.as_expr()**k\n 187: \n 188:     return result\n 189: \n 190: \n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a clearer picture of the bug. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. The `apart` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py` is responsible for partial fraction decomposition\n2. When the expression contains multiple variables (like `a` and `t`), the function checks if `P.is_multivariate` at line 120\n3. If it's multivariate, it tries to cancel the expression first (line 121-123), but if that doesn't help, it raises a `NotImplementedError` for \"multivariate partial fraction decomposition\" (line 125-126)\n\nHowever, the bug shows that instead of raising an error, it's returning `-a*t`, which suggests the cancellation or some other part of the logic is incorrectly simplifying the expression.\n\nLet me check what happens during the polynomial conversion step and see if there's an issue with how multivariate expressions are handled.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"parallel_poly_from_expr\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'parallel_poly_from_expr' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/numberfields.py\nLines 12-18:\n  12: \n  13: from sympy.polys.polytools import (\n  14:     Poly, PurePoly, sqf_norm, invert, factor_list, groebner, resultant,\n  15:     degree, poly_from_expr, parallel_poly_from_expr, lcm\n  16: )\n  17: \n  18: from sympy.polys.polyerrors import (\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/numberfields.py\nLines 264-270:\n 264:             p1 = R(dict_from_expr(mp1)[0])\n 265:             p2 = R(dict_from_expr(mp2)[0])\n 266:         else:\n 267:             (p1, p2), _ = parallel_poly_from_expr((mp1, x -

Instead of proper partial fraction decomposition or raising an error, it returns the simplified but incorrect result `-a*t`\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Navigated project structure\n- `search_code_with_context`: Located `apart` function and related code\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined function implementations in detail\n\n## Current Progress Status\n**Investigation Phase Complete**: \n- ✅ Located the buggy function\n- ✅ Identified the problematic code section (multivariate handling)\n- ✅ Understood the expected vs. actual behavior\n\n**Next Steps Needed**:\n1. Create a test case to reproduce the bug\n2. Debug the multivariate cancellation logic (lines 121-123)\n3. Examine `parallel_poly_from_expr` behavior with symbolic coefficients\n4. Fix the logic to properly handle expressions like `a * f(t)` where `a` is a symbolic coefficient\n5. Ensure the fix maintains backward compatibility\n\n## Technical Details\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n**Function**: `apart()` (lines 17-149)\n**Issue Location**: Multivariate expression handling (lines 120-126)\n**Related Functions**: \n- `apart_undetermined_coeffs()` (lines 152-188)\n- `parallel_poly_from_expr()` (imported from polytools)\n\nThe bug likely stems from the cancellation step not preserving the proper structure for partial fraction decomposition when symbolic coefficients are present.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug better. Looking at the `apart` function implementation, I can see the issue:\n\n1. The expression `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` should simplify to something that can be decomposed into partial fractions\n2. When `a=1` is substituted first, it works correctly: `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n3. But when `apart(t)` is called directly on the expression with symbolic `a`, it incorrectly returns `-a*t`\n\nThe problem seems to be in how the function handles multivariate expressions (expressions with both `a` and `t`). Let me examine the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function since that's what gets called when `full=False` (the default).\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", \"start_line\": 152, \"end_line\": 190 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\nTotal lines: 498\nShowing lines 152-190:\n\n 152: def apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q):\n 153:     \"\"\"Partial fractions via method of undetermined coefficients. \"\"\"\n 154:     X = numbered_symbols(cls=Dummy)\n 155:     partial, symbols = [], []\n 156: \n 157:     _, factors = Q.factor_list()\n 158: \n 159:     for f, k in factors:\n 160:         n, q = f.degree(), Q\n 161: \n 162:         for i in range(1, k + 1):\n 163:             coeffs, q = take(X, n), q.quo(f)\n 164:             partial.append((coeffs, q, f, i))\n 165:             symbols.extend(coeffs)\n 166: \n 167:     dom = Q.get_domain().inject(*symbols)\n 168:     F = Poly(0, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 169: \n 170:     for i, (coeffs, q, f, k) in enumerate(partial):\n 171:         h = Poly(coeffs, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 172:         partial[i] = (h, f, k)\n 173:         q = q.set_domain(dom)\n 174:         F += h*q\n 175: \n 176:     system, result = [], S(0)\n 177: \n 178:     for (k,), coeff in F.terms():\n 179:         system.append(coeff - P.nth(k))\n 180: \n 181:     from sympy.solvers import solve\n 182:     solution = solve(system, symbols)\n 183: \n 184:     for h, f, k in partial:\n 185:         h = h.as_expr().subs(solution)\n 186:         result += h/f.as_expr()**k\n 187: \n 188:     return result\n 189: \n 190: \n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clearer picture of the bug.

Project Structure Exploration\n- Located SymPy project at `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy`\n- Identified the `apart` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n\n### 2. Code Analysis\n**Main `apart` function** (lines 17-149):\n- Converts input to polynomials using `parallel_poly_from_expr`\n- Handles multivariate cases with special logic\n- Uses `apart_undetermined_coeffs` for default decomposition method\n\n**Key findings**:\n- Line 120: Checks `P.is_multivariate` for expressions with multiple variables\n- Lines 121-123: Attempts cancellation for multivariate expressions\n- Lines 125-126: Should raise `NotImplementedError` for multivariate partial fractions\n- Lines 136-139: Chooses between undetermined coefficients method vs. full decomposition\n\n### 3. Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug appears to be in the multivariate handling logic:\n1. When expression contains both `a` and `t`, it's classified as multivariate\n2. The cancellation step (line 121-123) may be incorrectly simplifying the expression\n3. Instead of proper partial fraction decomposition or raising an error, it returns the simplified but incorrect result `-a*t`\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Navigated project structure\n- `search_code_with_context`: Located `apart` function and related code\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined function implementations in detail\n\n## Current Progress Status\n**Investigation Phase Complete**: \n- ✅ Located the buggy function\n- ✅ Identified the problematic code section (multivariate handling)\n- ✅ Understood the expected vs. actual behavior\n\n**Next Steps Needed**:\n1. Create a test case to reproduce the bug\n2. Debug the multivariate cancellation logic (lines 121-123)\n3. Examine `parallel_poly_from_expr` behavior with symbolic coefficients\n4. Fix the logic to properly handle expressions like `a * f(t)` where `a` is a symbolic coefficient\n5. Ensure the fix maintains backward compatibility\n\n## Technical Details\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n**Function**: `apart()` (lines 17-149)\n**Issue Location**: Multivariate expression handling (lines 120-126)\n**Related Functions**: \n- `apart_undetermined_coeffs()` (lines 152-188)\n- `parallel_poly_from_expr()` (imported from polytools)\n\nThe bug likely stems from the cancellation step not preserving the proper structure for partial fraction decomposition when symbolic coefficients are present.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug better. Looking at the `apart` function implementation, I can see the issue:\n\n1. The expression `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` should simplify to something that can be decomposed into partial fractions\n2. When `a=1` is substituted first, it works correctly: `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n3. But when `apart(t)` is called directly on the expression with symbolic `a`, it incorrectly returns `-a*t`\n\nThe problem seems to be in how the function handles multivariate expressions (expressions with both `a` and `t`). Let me examine the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function since that's what gets called when `full=False` (the default).\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", \"start_line\": 152, \"end_line\": 190 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\nTotal lines: 498\nShowing lines 152-190:\n\n 152: def apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q):\n 153:     \"\"\"Partial fractions via method of undetermined coefficients. \"\"\"\n 154:     X = numbered_symbols(cls=Dummy)\n 155:     partial, symbols = [], []\n 156: \n 157:     _, factors = Q.factor_list()\n 158: \n 159:     for f, k in factors:\n 160:         n, q = f.degree(), Q\n 161: \n 162:         for i in range(1, k + 1):\n 163:             coeffs, q = take(X, n), q.quo(f)\n 164:             partial.append((coeffs, q, f, i))\n 165:             symbols.extend(coeffs)\n 166: \n 167:     dom = Q.get_domain().inject(*symbols)\n 168:     F = Poly(0, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 169: \n 170:     for i, (coeffs, q, f, k) in enumerate(partial):\n 171:         h = Poly(coeffs, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 172:         partial[i] = (h, f, k)\n 173:         q = q.set_domain(dom)\n 174:         F += h*q\n 175: \n 176:     system, result = [], S(0)\n 177: \n 178:     for (k,), coeff in F.terms():\n 179:         system.append(coeff - P.nth(k))\n 180: \n 181:     from sympy.solvers import solve\n 182:     solution = solve(system, symbols)\n 183: \n 184:     for h, f, k in partial:\n 185:         h = h.as_expr().subs(solution)\n 186:         result += h/f.as_expr()**k\n 187: \n 188:     return result\n 189: \n 190: \n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clearer picture of the bug.

Project Structure Exploration\n- Located SymPy project at `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy`\n- Identified the `apart` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n\n### 2. Code Analysis\n**Main `apart` function** (lines 17-149):\n- Converts input to polynomials using `parallel_poly_from_expr`\n- Handles multivariate cases with special logic\n- Uses `apart_undetermined_coeffs` for default decomposition method\n\n**Key findings**:\n- Line 120: Checks `P.is_multivariate` for expressions with multiple variables\n- Lines 121-123: Attempts cancellation for multivariate expressions\n- Lines 125-126: Should raise `NotImplementedError` for multivariate partial fractions\n- Lines 136-139: Chooses between undetermined coefficients method vs. full decomposition\n\n### 3. Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug appears to be in the multivariate handling logic:\n1. When expression contains both `a` and `t`, it's classified as multivariate\n2. The cancellation step (line 121-123) may be incorrectly simplifying the expression\n3. Instead of proper partial fraction decomposition or raising an error, it returns the simplified but incorrect result `-a*t`\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Navigated project structure\n- `search_code_with_context`: Located `apart` function and related code\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined function implementations in detail\n\n## Current Progress Status\n**Investigation Phase Complete**: \n- ✅ Located the buggy function\n- ✅ Identified the problematic code section (multivariate handling)\n- ✅ Understood the expected vs. actual behavior\n\n**Next Steps Needed**:\n1. Create a test case to reproduce the bug\n2. Debug the multivariate cancellation logic (lines 121-123)\n3. Examine `parallel_poly_from_expr` behavior with symbolic coefficients\n4. Fix the logic to properly handle expressions like `a * f(t)` where `a` is a symbolic coefficient\n5. Ensure the fix maintains backward compatibility\n\n## Technical Details\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n**Function**: `apart()` (lines 17-149)\n**Issue Location**: Multivariate expression handling (lines 120-126)\n**Related Functions**: \n- `apart_undetermined_coeffs()` (lines 152-188)\n- `parallel_poly_from_expr()` (imported from polytools)\n\nThe bug likely stems from the cancellation step not preserving the proper structure for partial fraction decomposition when symbolic coefficients are present.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug better. Looking at the `apart` function implementation, I can see the issue:\n\n1. The expression `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` should simplify to something that can be decomposed into partial fractions\n2. When `a=1` is substituted first, it works correctly: `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n3. But when `apart(t)` is called directly on the expression with symbolic `a`, it incorrectly returns `-a*t`\n\nThe problem seems to be in how the function handles multivariate expressions (expressions with both `a` and `t`). Let me examine the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function since that's what gets called when `full=False` (the default).\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", \"start_line\": 152, \"end_line\": 190 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\nTotal lines: 498\nShowing lines 152-190:\n\n 152: def apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q):\n 153:     \"\"\"Partial fractions via method of undetermined coefficients. \"\"\"\n 154:     X = numbered_symbols(cls=Dummy)\n 155:     partial, symbols = [], []\n 156: \n 157:     _, factors = Q.factor_list()\n 158: \n 159:     for f, k in factors:\n 160:         n, q = f.degree(), Q\n 161: \n 162:         for i in range(1, k + 1):\n 163:             coeffs, q = take(X, n), q.quo(f)\n 164:             partial.append((coeffs, q, f, i))\n 165:             symbols.extend(coeffs)\n 166: \n 167:     dom = Q.get_domain().inject(*symbols)\n 168:     F = Poly(0, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 169: \n 170:     for i, (coeffs, q, f, k) in enumerate(partial):\n 171:         h = Poly(coeffs, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 172:         partial[i] = (h, f, k)\n 173:         q = q.set_domain(dom)\n 174:         F += h*q\n 175: \n 176:     system, result = [], S(0)\n 177: \n 178:     for (k,), coeff in F.terms():\n 179:         system.append(coeff - P.nth(k))\n 180: \n 181:     from sympy.solvers import solve\n 182:     solution = solve(system, symbols)\n 183: \n 184:     for h, f, k in partial:\n 185:         h = h.as_expr().subs(solution)\n 186:         result += h/f.as_expr()**k\n 187: \n 188:     return result\n 189: \n 190: \n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clearer picture of the bug.

If it's multivariate, it tries to cancel the expression first (line 121-123), but if that doesn't help, it raises a `NotImplementedError` for \"multivariate partial fraction decomposition\" (line 125-126)\n\nHowever, the bug shows that instead of raising an error, it's returning `-a*t`, which suggests the cancellation or some other part of the logic is incorrectly simplifying the expression.\n\nLet me check what happens during the polynomial conversion step and see if there's an issue with how multivariate expressions are handled.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"parallel_poly_from_expr\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'parallel_poly_from_expr' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/numberfields.py\nLines 12-18:\n  12: \n  13: from sympy.polys.polytools import (\n  14:     Poly, PurePoly, sqf_norm, invert, factor_list, groebner, resultant,\n  15:     degree, poly_from_expr, parallel_poly_from_expr, lcm\n  16: )\n  17: \n  18: from sympy.polys.polyerrors import (\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/numberfields.py\nLines 264-270:\n 264:             p1 = R(dict_from_expr(mp1)[0])\n 265:             p2 = R(dict_from_expr(mp2)[0])\n 266:         else:\n 267:             (p1, p2), _ = parallel_poly_from_expr((mp1, x -

Project Structure Exploration\n- Located SymPy project at `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy`\n- Identified the `apart` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n\n### 2. Code Analysis\n**Main `apart` function** (lines 17-149):\n- Converts input to polynomials using `parallel_poly_from_expr`\n- Handles multivariate cases with special logic\n- Uses `apart_undetermined_coeffs` for default decomposition method\n\n**Key findings**:\n- Line 120: Checks `P.is_multivariate` for expressions with multiple variables\n- Lines 121-123: Attempts cancellation for multivariate expressions\n- Lines 125-126: Should raise `NotImplementedError` for multivariate partial fractions\n- Lines 136-139: Chooses between undetermined coefficients method vs. full decomposition\n\n### 3. Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug appears to be in the multivariate handling logic:\n1. When expression contains both `a` and `t`, it's classified as multivariate\n2. The cancellation step (line 121-123) may be incorrectly simplifying the expression\n3. Instead of proper partial fraction decomposition or raising an error, it returns the simplified but incorrect result `-a*t`\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Navigated project structure\n- `search_code_with_context`: Located `apart` function and related code\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined function implementations in detail\n\n## Current Progress Status\n**Investigation Phase Complete**: \n- ✅ Located the buggy function\n- ✅ Identified the problematic code section (multivariate handling)\n- ✅ Understood the expected vs. actual behavior\n\n**Next Steps Needed**:\n1. Create a test case to reproduce the bug\n2. Debug the multivariate cancellation logic (lines 121-123)\n3. Examine `parallel_poly_from_expr` behavior with symbolic coefficients\n4. Fix the logic to properly handle expressions like `a * f(t)` where `a` is a symbolic coefficient\n5. Ensure the fix maintains backward compatibility\n\n## Technical Details\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n**Function**: `apart()` (lines 17-149)\n**Issue Location**: Multivariate expression handling (lines 120-126)\n**Related Functions**: \n- `apart_undetermined_coeffs()` (lines 152-188)\n- `parallel_poly_from_expr()` (imported from polytools)\n\nThe bug likely stems from the cancellation step not preserving the proper structure for partial fraction decomposition when symbolic coefficients are present.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug better. Looking at the `apart` function implementation, I can see the issue:\n\n1. The expression `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` should simplify to something that can be decomposed into partial fractions\n2. When `a=1` is substituted first, it works correctly: `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n3. But when `apart(t)` is called directly on the expression with symbolic `a`, it incorrectly returns `-a*t`\n\nThe problem seems to be in how the function handles multivariate expressions (expressions with both `a` and `t`). Let me examine the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function since that's what gets called when `full=False` (the default).\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", \"start_line\": 152, \"end_line\": 190 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\nTotal lines: 498\nShowing lines 152-190:\n\n 152: def apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q):\n 153:     \"\"\"Partial fractions via method of undetermined coefficients. \"\"\"\n 154:     X = numbered_symbols(cls=Dummy)\n 155:     partial, symbols = [], []\n 156: \n 157:     _, factors = Q.factor_list()\n 158: \n 159:     for f, k in factors:\n 160:         n, q = f.degree(), Q\n 161: \n 162:         for i in range(1, k + 1):\n 163:             coeffs, q = take(X, n), q.quo(f)\n 164:             partial.append((coeffs, q, f, i))\n 165:             symbols.extend(coeffs)\n 166: \n 167:     dom = Q.get_domain().inject(*symbols)\n 168:     F = Poly(0, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 169: \n 170:     for i, (coeffs, q, f, k) in enumerate(partial):\n 171:         h = Poly(coeffs, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 172:         partial[i] = (h, f, k)\n 173:         q = q.set_domain(dom)\n 174:         F += h*q\n 175: \n 176:     system, result = [], S(0)\n 177: \n 178:     for (k,), coeff in F.terms():\n 179:         system.append(coeff - P.nth(k))\n 180: \n 181:     from sympy.solvers import solve\n 182:     solution = solve(system, symbols)\n 183: \n 184:     for h, f, k in partial:\n 185:         h = h.as_expr().subs(solution)\n 186:         result += h/f.as_expr()**k\n 187: \n 188:     return result\n 189: \n 190: \n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clearer picture of the bug. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. The `apart` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py` is responsible for partial fraction decomposition\n2. When the expression contains multiple variables (like `a` and `t`), the function checks if `P.is_multivariate` at line 120\n3. If it's multivariate, it tries to cancel the expression first (line 121-123), but if that doesn't help, it raises a `NotImplementedError` for \"multivariate partial fraction decomposition\" (line 125-126)\n\nHowever, the bug shows that instead of raising an error, it's returning `-a*t`, which suggests the cancellation or some other part of the logic is incorrectly simplifying the expression.\n\nLet me check what happens during the polynomial conversion step and see if there's an issue with how multivariate expressions are handled.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"parallel_poly_from_expr\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'parallel_poly_from_expr' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/numberfields.py\nLines 12-18:\n  12: \n  13: from sympy.polys.polytools import (\n  14:     Poly, PurePoly, sqf_norm, invert, factor_list, groebner, resultant,\n  15:     degree, poly_from_expr, parallel_poly_from_expr, lcm\n  16: )\n  17: \n  18: from sympy.polys.polyerrors import (\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/numberfields.py\nLines 264-270:\n 264:             p1 = R(dict_from_expr(mp1)[0])\n 265:             p2 = R(dict_from_expr(mp2)[0])\n 266:         else:\n 267:             (p1, p2), _ = parallel_poly_from_expr((mp1, x -

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Summary: SymPy `apart` Function Bug Investigation\n\n## Main Objective\nInvestigating and repairing a bug in SymPy's `apart` function where partial fraction decomposition returns incorrect results when the expression contains symbolic coefficients.\n\n## Bug Description\nThe `apart` function behaves inconsistently:\n- **Correct behavior**: `bug.subs(a, 1).apart(t)` returns `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n- **Incorrect behavior**: `bug.apart(t)` returns `-a*t` (should return the same structure with `a` as a coefficient)\n\nWhere `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- Located SymPy project at `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy`\n- Identified the `apart` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n\n### 2. Code Analysis\n**Main `apart` function** (lines 17-149):\n- Converts input to polynomials using `parallel_poly_from_expr`\n- Handles multivariate cases with special logic\n- Uses `apart_undetermined_coeffs` for default decomposition method\n\n**Key findings**:\n- Line 120: Checks `P.is_multivariate` for expressions with multiple variables\n- Lines 121-123: Attempts cancellation for multivariate expressions\n- Lines 125-126: Should raise `NotImplementedError` for multivariate partial fractions\n- Lines 136-139: Chooses between undetermined coefficients method vs. full decomposition\n\n### 3. Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug appears to be in the multivariate handling logic:\n1. When expression contains both `a` and `t`, it's classified as multivariate\n2. The cancellation step (line 121-123) may be incorrectly simplifying the expression\n3. Instead of proper partial fraction decomposition or raising an error, it returns the simplified but incorrect result `-a*t`\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Navigated project structure\n- `search_code_with_context`: Located `apart` function and related code\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined function implementations in detail\n\n## Current Progress Status\n**Investigation Phase Complete**: \n- ✅ Located the buggy function\n- ✅ Identified the problematic code section (multivariate handling)\n- ✅ Understood the expected vs. actual behavior\n\n**Next Steps Needed**:\n1. Create a test case to reproduce the bug\n2. Debug the multivariate cancellation logic (lines 121-123)\n3. Examine `parallel_poly_from_expr` behavior with symbolic coefficients\n4. Fix the logic to properly handle expressions like `a * f(t)` where `a` is a symbolic coefficient\n5. Ensure the fix maintains backward compatibility\n\n## Technical Details\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n**Function**: `apart()` (lines 17-149)\n**Issue Location**: Multivariate expression handling (lines 120-126)\n**Related Functions**: \n- `apart_undetermined_coeffs()` (lines 152-188)\n- `parallel_poly_from_expr()` (imported from polytools)\n\nThe bug likely stems from the cancellation step not preserving the proper structure for partial fraction decomposition when symbolic coefficients are present.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug better. Looking at the `apart` function implementation, I can see the issue:\n\n1. The expression `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` should simplify to something that can be decomposed into partial fractions\n2. When `a=1` is substituted first, it works correctly: `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n3. But when `apart(t)` is called directly on the expression with symbolic `a`, it incorrectly returns `-a*t`\n\nThe problem seems to be in how the function handles multivariate expressions (expressions with both `a` and `t`). Let me examine the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function since that's what gets called when `full=False` (the default).\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", \"start_line\": 152, \"end_line\": 190 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\nTotal lines: 498\nShowing lines 152-190:\n\n 152: def apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q):\n 153:     \"\"\"Partial fractions via method of undetermined coefficients. \"\"\"\n 154:     X = numbered_symbols(cls=Dummy)\n 155:     partial, symbols = [], []\n 156: \n 157:     _, factors = Q.factor_list()\n 158: \n 159:     for f, k in factors:\n 160:         n, q = f.degree(), Q\n 161: \n 162:         for i in range(1, k + 1):\n 163:             coeffs, q = take(X, n), q.quo(f)\n 164:             partial.append((coeffs, q, f, i))\n 165:             symbols.extend(coeffs)\n 166: \n 167:     dom = Q.get_domain().inject(*symbols)\n 168:     F = Poly(0, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 169: \n 170:     for i, (coeffs, q, f, k) in enumerate(partial):\n 171:         h = Poly(coeffs, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 172:         partial[i] = (h, f, k)\n 173:         q = q.set_domain(dom)\n 174:         F += h*q\n 175: \n 176:     system, result = [], S(0)\n 177: \n 178:     for (k,), coeff in F.terms():\n 179:         system.append(coeff - P.nth(k))\n 180: \n 181:     from sympy.solvers import solve\n 182:     solution = solve(system, symbols)\n 183: \n 184:     for h, f, k in partial:\n 185:         h = h.as_expr().subs(solution)\n 186:         result += h/f.as_expr()**k\n 187: \n 188:     return result\n 189: \n 190: \n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clearer picture of the bug. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. The `apart` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py` is responsible for partial fraction decomposition\n2. When the expression contains multiple variables (like `a` and `t`), the function checks if `P.is_multivariate` at line 120\n3. If it's multivariate, it tries to cancel the expression first (line 121-123), but if that doesn't help, it raises a `NotImplementedError` for \"multivariate partial fraction decomposition\" (line 125-126)\n\nHowever, the bug shows that instead of raising an error, it's returning `-a*t`, which suggests the cancellation or some other part of the logic is incorrectly simplifying the expression.\n\nLet me check what happens during the polynomial conversion step and see if there's an issue with how multivariate expressions are handled.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"parallel_poly_from_expr\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'parallel_poly_from_expr' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/numberfields.py\nLines 12-18:\n  12: \n  13: from sympy.polys.polytools import (\n  14:     Poly, PurePoly, sqf_norm, invert, factor_list, groebner, resultant,\n  15:     degree, poly_from_expr, parallel_poly_from_expr, lcm\n  16: )\n  17: \n  18: from sympy.polys.polyerrors import (\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/numberfields.py\nLines 264-270:\n 264:             p1 = R(dict_from_expr(mp1)[0])\n 265:             p2 = R(dict_from_expr(mp2)[0])\n 266:         else:\n 267:             (p1, p2), _ = parallel_poly_from_expr((mp1, x -

Project Structure Exploration\n- Located SymPy project at `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy`\n- Identified the `apart` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n\n### 2. Code Analysis\n**Main `apart` function** (lines 17-149):\n- Converts input to polynomials using `parallel_poly_from_expr`\n- Handles multivariate cases with special logic\n- Uses `apart_undetermined_coeffs` for default decomposition method\n\n**Key findings**:\n- Line 120: Checks `P.is_multivariate` for expressions with multiple variables\n- Lines 121-123: Attempts cancellation for multivariate expressions\n- Lines 125-126: Should raise `NotImplementedError` for multivariate partial fractions\n- Lines 136-139: Chooses between undetermined coefficients method vs. full decomposition\n\n### 3. Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug appears to be in the multivariate handling logic:\n1. When expression contains both `a` and `t`, it's classified as multivariate\n2. The cancellation step (line 121-123) may be incorrectly simplifying the expression\n3. Instead of proper partial fraction decomposition or raising an error, it returns the simplified but incorrect result `-a*t`\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Navigated project structure\n- `search_code_with_context`: Located `apart` function and related code\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined function implementations in detail\n\n## Current Progress Status\n**Investigation Phase Complete**: \n- ✅ Located the buggy function\n- ✅ Identified the problematic code section (multivariate handling)\n- ✅ Understood the expected vs. actual behavior\n\n**Next Steps Needed**:\n1. Create a test case to reproduce the bug\n2. Debug the multivariate cancellation logic (lines 121-123)\n3. Examine `parallel_poly_from_expr` behavior with symbolic coefficients\n4. Fix the logic to properly handle expressions like `a * f(t)` where `a` is a symbolic coefficient\n5.

Looking at the `apart` function implementation, I can see the issue:\n\n1. The expression `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` should simplify to something that can be decomposed into partial fractions\n2. When `a=1` is substituted first, it works correctly: `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n3. But when `apart(t)` is called directly on the expression with symbolic `a`, it incorrectly returns `-a*t`\n\nThe problem seems to be in how the function handles multivariate expressions (expressions with both `a` and `t`).

If it's multivariate, it tries to cancel the expression first (line 121-123), but if that doesn't help, it raises a `NotImplementedError` for \"multivariate partial fraction decomposition\" (line 125-126)\n\nHowever, the bug shows that instead of raising an error, it's returning `-a*t`, which suggests the cancellation or some other part of the logic is incorrectly simplifying the expression.\n\nLet me check what happens during the polynomial conversion step and see if there's an issue with how multivariate expressions are handled.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"parallel_poly_from_expr\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'parallel_poly_from_expr' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/numberfields.py\nLines 12-18:\n  12: \n  13: from sympy.polys.polytools import (\n  14:     Poly, PurePoly, sqf_norm, invert, factor_list, groebner, resultant,\n  15:     degree, poly_from_expr, parallel_poly_from_expr, lcm\n  16: )\n  17: \n  18: from sympy.polys.polyerrors import (\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/numberfields.py\nLines 264-270:\n 264:             p1 = R(dict_from_expr(mp1)[0])\n 265:             p2 = R(dict_from_expr(mp2)[0])\n 266:         else:\n 267:             (p1, p2), _ = parallel_poly_from_expr((mp1, x -

The bug occurs because when an expression contains both a symbolic coefficient (like `a`) and the variable for decomposition (like `t`), the function incorrectly treats it as a multivariate expression and applies cancellation that over-simplifies the result.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 120,\n            \"end_line\": 126\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 80,\n            \"end_line\": 86\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 128,\n            \"end_line\": 139\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 152,\n            \"end_line\": 188\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 17,\n            \"end_line\": 50\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe problem statement the project is:\nWrong result with apart\n```\r\nPython 3.6.0 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Dec 23 2016, 12:22:00) \r\nType \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n\r\nIPython 5.1.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.\r\n?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.\r\n%quickref -> Quick reference.\r\nhelp      -> Python's own help system.\r\nobject?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.\r\n\r\nIn [1]: from sympy import symbols\r\n\r\nIn [2]: a = symbols('a', real=True)\r\n\r\nIn [3]: t = symbols('t', real=True, negative=False)\r\n\r\nIn [4]: bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)\r\n\r\nIn [5]: bug.subs(a, 1)\r\nOut[5]: (-t + (-t + 1)*(2*t - 1))/(2*t - 1)\r\n\r\nIn [6]: bug.subs(a, 1).apart()\r\nOut[6]: -t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))\r\n\r\nIn [7]: bug.subs(a, 1).apart(t)\r\nOut[7]: -t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))\r\n\r\nIn [8]: bug.apart(t)\r\nOut[8]: -a*t\r\n\r\nIn [9]: import sympy; sympy.__version__\r\nOut[9]: '1.0'\r\n```\nWrong result with apart\n```\r\nPython 3.6.0 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Dec 23 2016, 12:22:00) \r\nType \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n\r\nIPython 5.1.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.\r\n?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.\r\n%quickref -> Quick reference.\r\nhelp      -> Python's own help system.\r\nobject?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.\r\n\r\nIn [1]: from sympy import symbols\r\n\r\nIn [2]: a = symbols('a', real=True)\r\n\r\nIn [3]: t = symbols('t', real=True, negative=False)\r\n\r\nIn [4]: bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)\r\n\r\nIn [5]: bug.subs(a, 1)\r\nOut[5]: (-t + (-t + 1)*(2*t - 1))/(2*t - 1)\r\n\r\nIn [6]: bug.subs(a, 1).apart()\r\nOut[6]: -t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))\r\n\r\nIn [7]: bug.subs(a, 1).apart(t)\r\nOut[7]: -t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))\r\n\r\nIn [8]: bug.apart(t)\r\nOut[8]: -a*t\r\n\r\nIn [9]: import sympy; sympy.__version__\r\nOut[9]: '1.0'\r\n```\n",
    "response": "PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the `apart` function bug, I have identified the root cause and can provide specific repair suggestions for each location. The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression. The final result multiplies the decomposed parts by the factored coefficients.",

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Summary: SymPy `apart` Function Bug Investigation\n\n## Main Objective\nInvestigating and repairing a bug in SymPy's `apart` function where partial fraction decomposition returns incorrect results when the expression contains symbolic coefficients.\n\n## Bug Description\nThe `apart` function behaves inconsistently:\n- **Correct behavior**: `bug.subs(a, 1).apart(t)` returns `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n- **Incorrect behavior**: `bug.apart(t)` returns `-a*t` (should return the same structure with `a` as a coefficient)\n\nWhere `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- Located SymPy project at `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy`\n- Identified the `apart` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n\n### 2. Code Analysis\n**Main `apart` function** (lines 17-149):\n- Converts input to polynomials using `parallel_poly_from_expr`\n- Handles multivariate cases with special logic\n- Uses `apart_undetermined_coeffs` for default decomposition method\n\n**Key findings**:\n- Line 120: Checks `P.is_multivariate` for expressions with multiple variables\n- Lines 121-123: Attempts cancellation for multivariate expressions\n- Lines 125-126: Should raise `NotImplementedError` for multivariate partial fractions\n- Lines 136-139: Chooses between undetermined coefficients method vs. full decomposition\n\n### 3. Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug appears to be in the multivariate handling logic:\n1. When expression contains both `a` and `t`, it's classified as multivariate\n2. The cancellation step (line 121-123) may be incorrectly simplifying the expression\n3. Instead of proper partial fraction decomposition or raising an error, it returns the simplified but incorrect result `-a*t`\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Navigated project structure\n- `search_code_with_context`: Located `apart` function and related code\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined function implementations in detail\n\n## Current Progress Status\n**Investigation Phase Complete**: \n- ✅ Located the buggy function\n- ✅ Identified the problematic code section (multivariate handling)\n- ✅ Understood the expected vs. actual behavior\n\n**Next Steps Needed**:\n1. Create a test case to reproduce the bug\n2. Debug the multivariate cancellation logic (lines 121-123)\n3. Examine `parallel_poly_from_expr` behavior with symbolic coefficients\n4. Fix the logic to properly handle expressions like `a * f(t)` where `a` is a symbolic coefficient\n5. Ensure the fix maintains backward compatibility\n\n## Technical Details\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n**Function**: `apart()` (lines 17-149)\n**Issue Location**: Multivariate expression handling (lines 120-126)\n**Related Functions**: \n- `apart_undetermined_coeffs()` (lines 152-188)\n- `parallel_poly_from_expr()` (imported from polytools)\n\nThe bug likely stems from the cancellation step not preserving the proper structure for partial fraction decomposition when symbolic coefficients are present.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug better. Looking at the `apart` function implementation, I can see the issue:\n\n1. The expression `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` should simplify to something that can be decomposed into partial fractions\n2. When `a=1` is substituted first, it works correctly: `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n3. But when `apart(t)` is called directly on the expression with symbolic `a`, it incorrectly returns `-a*t`\n\nThe problem seems to be in how the function handles multivariate expressions (expressions with both `a` and `t`). Let me examine the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function since that's what gets called when `full=False` (the default).\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", \"start_line\": 152, \"end_line\": 190 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\nTotal lines: 498\nShowing lines 152-190:\n\n 152: def apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q):\n 153:     \"\"\"Partial fractions via method of undetermined coefficients. \"\"\"\n 154:     X = numbered_symbols(cls=Dummy)\n 155:     partial, symbols = [], []\n 156: \n 157:     _, factors = Q.factor_list()\n 158: \n 159:     for f, k in factors:\n 160:         n, q = f.degree(), Q\n 161: \n 162:         for i in range(1, k + 1):\n 163:             coeffs, q = take(X, n), q.quo(f)\n 164:             partial.append((coeffs, q, f, i))\n 165:             symbols.extend(coeffs)\n 166: \n 167:     dom = Q.get_domain().inject(*symbols)\n 168:     F = Poly(0, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 169: \n 170:     for i, (coeffs, q, f, k) in enumerate(partial):\n 171:         h = Poly(coeffs, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n 172:         partial[i] = (h, f, k)\n 173:         q = q.set_domain(dom)\n 174:         F += h*q\n 175: \n 176:     system, result = [], S(0)\n 177: \n 178:     for (k,), coeff in F.terms():\n 179:         system.append(coeff - P.nth(k))\n 180: \n 181:     from sympy.solvers import solve\n 182:     solution = solve(system, symbols)\n 183: \n 184:     for h, f, k in partial:\n 185:         h = h.as_expr().subs(solution)\n 186:         result += h/f.as_expr()**k\n 187: \n 188:     return result\n 189: \n 190: \n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a clearer picture of the bug. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. The `apart` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py` is responsible for partial fraction decomposition\n2. When the expression contains multiple variables (like `a` and `t`), the function checks if `P.is_multivariate` at line 120\n3. If it's multivariate, it tries to cancel the expression first (line 121-123), but if that doesn't help, it raises a `NotImplementedError` for \"multivariate partial fraction decomposition\" (line 125-126)\n\nHowever, the bug shows that instead of raising an error, it's returning `-a*t`, which suggests the cancellation or some other part of the logic is incorrectly simplifying the expression.\n\nLet me check what happens during the polynomial conversion step and see if there's an issue with how multivariate expressions are handled.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"parallel_poly_from_expr\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'parallel_poly_from_expr' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/numberfields.py\nLines 12-18:\n  12: \n  13: from sympy.polys.polytools import (\n  14:     Poly, PurePoly, sqf_norm, invert, factor_list, groebner, resultant,\n  15:     degree, poly_from_expr, parallel_poly_from_expr, lcm\n  16: )\n  17: \n  18: from sympy.polys.polyerrors import (\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/numberfields.py\nLines 264-270:\n 264:             p1 = R(dict_from_expr(mp1)[0])\n 265:             p2 = R(dict_from_expr(mp2)[0])\n 266:         else:\n 267:             (p1, p2), _ = parallel_poly_from_expr((mp1, x -

Lines 125-126: If cancellation doesn't help, it should raise `NotImplementedError`\n\nThe bug is that when `bug.apart(t)` is called, the expression contains both `a` and `t`, so `P.is_multivariate` is True. The cancellation step (`f.cancel()`) is likely simplifying the expression incorrectly to `-a*t` instead of preserving the structure needed for partial fraction decomposition.\n\nLet me examine what the `cancel` function does and see if that's where the problem lies.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"def cancel\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'def cancel' in directory (showing first 5 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/rings.py\nLines 2185-2191:\n2185: \n2186:         return h, cff, cfg\n2187: \n2188:     def cancel(self, g):\n2189:         \"\"\"\n2190:         Cancel common factors in a rational function ``f/g``.\n2191: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/polyclasses.py\nLines 670-676:\n 670:         lev, dom, per, F, G = f.unify(g)\n 671:         return per(dmp_lcm(F, G, lev, dom))\n 672: \n 673:     def cancel(f, g, include=True):\n 674:         \"\"\"Cancel common factors in a rational function ``f/g``. \"\"\"\n 675:         lev, dom, per, F, G = f.unify(g)\n 676: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/polyclasses.py\nLines 1242-1248:\n1242:         \"\"\"Returns the denominator of ``f``. \"\"\"\n1243:         return f.half_per(f.den)\n1244: \n1245:     def cancel(f):\n1246:         \"\"\"Remove common factors from ``f.num`` and ``f.den``. \"\"\"\n1247:         return f.per(f.num, f.den)\n1248: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/polytools.py\nLines 3583-3589:\n3583: \n3584:         return r.replace(t, x)\n3585: \n3586:     def cancel(f, g, include=False):\n3587:         \"\"\"\n3588:         Cancel common factors in a rational function ``f/g``.\n3589: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/polytools.py\nLines 6352-6358:\n6352: \n6353: \n6354: @public\n6355: def cancel(f, *gens, **args):\n6356:     \"\"\"\n6357:     Cancel common factors in a rational function ``f``.\n6358: \n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug.

Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. The expression `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` should decompose into partial fractions\n2. When `a=1` is substituted first, `apart(t)` correctly returns `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`\n3. When `apart(t)` is called directly on the expression with symbolic `a`, it incorrectly returns `-a*t`\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe bug is in the multivariate handling logic in the `apart` function. When the expression contains both `a` and `t`, it's classified as multivariate, and the cancellation step incorrectly simplifies the expression instead of properly handling the symbolic coefficient `a`.\n\n**Key Locations Identified:**\n\n1. **Lines 120-126** in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`: The multivariate detection and cancellation logic that causes the bug\n2. **Lines 80-86** in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`: The `parallel_poly_from_expr` call that converts the expression to polynomials\n3. **Lines 17-149** in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`: The main `apart` function logic\n4. **Lines 152-188** in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`: The `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function that should handle the decomposition\n5. **Lines 128-139** in `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`: The logic that chooses between different decomposition methods\n\nThe fix should involve modifying the multivariate handling to properly factor out symbolic coefficients before attempting partial fraction decomposition, rather than treating them as additional variables that make the expression \"multivariate\" in the problematic sense.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my investigation, I have identified the following 5 precise and interrelated locations where the bug manifests and can be fixed:\n\n1. **Lines 120-126**: The multivariate detection and cancellation logic that incorrectly simplifies expressions with symbolic coefficients\n2. **Lines 80-86**: The polynomial conversion step that may not properly handle symbolic coefficients  \n3. **Lines 128-139**: The polynomial processing and method selection logic that follows the multivariate check\n4. **Lines 152-188**: The `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function that should handle the actual decomposition\n5. **Lines 17-50**: The main function signature and initial processing that sets up the decomposition\n\nThese locations are functionally connected as they represent the flow of the `apart` function from input processing through multivariate detection to the actual decomposition algorithm.\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my investigation of the `apart` function bug, I have identified the root cause and can propose the specific locations where the issue manifests. The bug occurs because when an expression contains both a symbolic coefficient (like `a`) and the variable for decomposition (like `t`), the function incorrectly treats it as a multivariate expression and applies cancellation that over-simplifies the result.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 120,\n            \"end_line\": 126\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 80,\n            \"end_line\": 86\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 128,\n            \"end_line\": 139\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 152,\n            \"end_line\": 188\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 17,\n            \"end_line\": 50\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nAssistant: PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the `apart` function bug, I have identified the root cause and can provide specific repair suggestions for each location. The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression. The final result multiplies the decomposed parts by the factored coefficients.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py lines 120-126\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    if P.is_multivariate:\n        fc = f.cancel()\n        if fc != f:\n            return apart(fc, x=x, full=full, **_options)\n\n        raise NotImplementedError(\n            \"multivariate partial fraction decomposition\")\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py lines 80-86\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    _options = options.copy()\n    options = set_defaults(options, extension=True)\n    try:\n        (P, Q), opt = parallel_poly_from_expr((P, Q), x, **options)\n    except PolynomialError as msg:\n        if f.is_commutative:\n            raise PolynomialError(msg)\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py lines 128-139\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    common, P, Q = P.cancel(Q)\n\n    poly, P = P.div(Q, auto=True)\n    P, Q = P.rat_clear_denoms(Q)\n\n    if Q.degree() <= 1:\n        partial = P/Q\n    else:\n        if not full:\n            partial = apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q)\n        else:\n            partial = apart_full_decomposition(P, Q)\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py lines 152-188\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndef apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q):\n    \"\"\"Partial fractions via method of undetermined coefficients. \"\"\"\n    X = numbered_symbols(cls=Dummy)\n    partial, symbols = [], []\n\n    _, factors = Q.factor_list()\n\n    for f, k in factors:\n        n, q = f.degree(), Q\n\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            coeffs, q = take(X, n), q.quo(f)\n            partial.append((coeffs, q, f, i))\n            symbols.extend(coeffs)\n\n    dom = Q.get_domain().inject(*symbols)\n    F = Poly(0, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n\n    for i, (coeffs, q, f, k) in enumerate(partial):\n        h = Poly(coeffs, Q.gen, domain=dom)\n        partial[i] = (h, f, k)\n        q = q.set_domain(dom)\n        F += h*q\n\n    system, result = [], S(0)\n\n    for (k,), coeff in F.terms():\n        system.append(coeff - P.nth(k))\n\n    from sympy.solvers import solve\n    solution = solve(system, symbols)\n\n    for h, f, k in partial:\n        h = h.as_expr().subs(solution)\n        result += h/f.as_expr()**k\n\n    return result\n\n\n[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py lines 17-50\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndef apart(f, x=None, full=False, **options):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute partial fraction decomposition of a rational function.\n\n    Given a rational function ``f``, computes the partial fraction\n    decomposition of ``f``.

Let me analyze each location:\n\n**Location 1 (lines 120-126)**: This is the core issue - when `P.is_multivariate` is True (because the expression contains both `a` and `t`), it calls `f.cancel()` which over-simplifies the expression to `-a*t`, losing the rational structure needed for partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Location 2 (lines 80-86)**: The polynomial conversion step where `parallel_poly_from_expr` treats the expression as multivariate, which triggers the problematic path in Location 1.\n\n**Location 3 (lines 128-139)**: The polynomial processing logic that would handle the decomposition if the expression weren't incorrectly simplified in Location 1.\n\n**Location 4 (lines 152-188)**: The `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function that performs the actual partial fraction decomposition - this works correctly but never gets called with the proper input due to the early simplification.\n\n**Location 5 (lines 17-50)**: The main entry point where preprocessing could be added to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main logic.\n\nThe bug flow is clear: `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` contains both `a` and `t`, so it's detected as multivariate, gets simplified to `-a*t` via cancellation, and then partial fraction decomposition is applied to this simplified form instead of the original rational structure.\n\nThe expected result should be `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (essentially the result when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\nThe suggested fix strategy of factoring out symbolic coefficients before applying partial fraction decomposition is sound and addresses the root cause.

The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients.

The bug occurs because when an expression contains both a symbolic coefficient (like `a`) and the variable for decomposition (like `t`), the function incorrectly treats it as a multivariate expression and applies cancellation that over-simplifies the result.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 120,\n            \"end_line\": 126\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 80,\n            \"end_line\": 86\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 128,\n            \"end_line\": 139\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 152,\n            \"end_line\": 188\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 17,\n            \"end_line\": 50\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the `apart` function bug, I have identified the root cause and can provide specific repair suggestions for each location.

Let me analyze each location:\n\n**Location 1 (lines 120-126)**: This is the core issue - when `P.is_multivariate` is True (because the expression contains both `a` and `t`), it calls `f.cancel()` which over-simplifies the expression to `-a*t`, losing the rational structure needed for partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Location 2 (lines 80-86)**: The polynomial conversion step where `parallel_poly_from_expr` treats the expression as multivariate, which triggers the problematic path in Location 1.\n\n**Location 3 (lines 128-139)**: The polynomial processing logic that would handle the decomposition if the expression weren't incorrectly simplified in Location 1.\n\n**Location 4 (lines 152-188)**: The `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function that performs the actual partial fraction decomposition - this works correctly but never gets called with the proper input due to the early simplification.\n\n**Location 5 (lines 17-50)**: The main entry point where preprocessing could be added to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main logic.\n\nThe bug flow is clear: `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` contains both `a` and `t`, so it's detected as multivariate, gets simplified to `-a*t` via cancellation, and then partial fraction decomposition is applied to this simplified form instead of the original rational structure.\n\nThe expected result should be `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (essentially the result when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\nThe suggested fix strategy of factoring out symbolic coefficients before applying partial fraction decomposition is sound and addresses the root cause. All locations are clearly identified and the coordination between them is well-defined.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py lines 120-126\n\nImports

The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression. The final result multiplies the decomposed parts by the factored coefficients.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nWrong result with apart\n```\r\nPython 3.6.0 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Dec 23 2016, 12:22:00) \r\nType \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n\r\nIPython 5.1.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.\r\n?

The bug occurs because when an expression contains both a symbolic coefficient (like `a`) and the variable for decomposition (like `t`), the function incorrectly treats it as a multivariate expression and applies cancellation that over-simplifies the result.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 120,\n            \"end_line\": 126\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 80,\n            \"end_line\": 86\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 128,\n            \"end_line\": 139\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 152,\n            \"end_line\": 188\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 17,\n            \"end_line\": 50\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the `apart` function bug, I have identified the root cause and can provide specific repair suggestions for each location. The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients.

Let me analyze each location:\n\n**Location 1 (lines 120-126)**: This is the core issue - when `P.is_multivariate` is True (because the expression contains both `a` and `t`), it calls `f.cancel()` which over-simplifies the expression to `-a*t`, losing the rational structure needed for partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Location 2 (lines 80-86)**: The polynomial conversion step where `parallel_poly_from_expr` treats the expression as multivariate, which triggers the problematic path in Location 1.\n\n**Location 3 (lines 128-139)**: The polynomial processing logic that would handle the decomposition if the expression weren't incorrectly simplified in Location 1.\n\n**Location 4 (lines 152-188)**: The `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function that performs the actual partial fraction decomposition - this works correctly but never gets called with the proper input due to the early simplification.\n\n**Location 5 (lines 17-50)**: The main entry point where preprocessing could be added to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main logic.\n\nThe bug flow is clear: `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` contains both `a` and `t`, so it's detected as multivariate, gets simplified to `-a*t` via cancellation, and then partial fraction decomposition is applied to this simplified form instead of the original rational structure.\n\nThe expected result should be `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (essentially the result when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\nThe suggested fix strategy of factoring out symbolic coefficients before applying partial fraction decomposition is sound and addresses the root cause. All locations are clearly identified and the coordination between them is well-defined.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py lines 120-126\n\nImports

The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression. The final result multiplies the decomposed parts by the factored coefficients.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\n#REFLECT\n\nLooking at the code locations and the bug description, I can see the issue clearly. The problem is that when an expression contains both a symbolic coefficient (like `a`) and the decomposition variable (like `t`), the function incorrectly treats it as multivariate and applies cancellation that over-simplifies the expression.\n\nThe bug flow is:\n1. `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` contains both `a` and `t`\n2. `P.is_multivariate` returns True\n3. `f.cancel()` simplifies to `-a*t`, losing the rational structure\n4. Partial fraction decomposition is applied to `-a*t` instead of the original expression\n\nThe expected result should be `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (the same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\nI need to implement a fix that detects symbolic coefficients and factors them out before applying partial fraction decomposition, then multiplies the result back by the coefficients.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines {\"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", \"start_line\": 70, \"end_line\": 90}\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\nTotal lines: 498\nShowing lines 70-90:\n\n  70:     \"\"\"\n  71:     allowed_flags(options, [])\n  72: \n  73:     f = sympify(f)\n  74: \n  75:     if f.is_Atom:\n  76:         return f\n  77:     else:\n  78:         P, Q = f.as_numer_denom()\n  79: \n  80:     _options = options.copy()\n  81:     options = set_defaults(options, extension=True)\n  82:     try:\n  83:         (P, Q), opt = parallel_poly_from_expr((P, Q), x, **options)\n  84:     except PolynomialError as msg:\n  85:         if f.is_commutative:\n  86:             raise PolynomialError(msg)\n  87:         # non-commutative\n  88:         if f.is_Mul:\n  89:             c, nc = f.args_cnc(split_1=False)\n  90:             nc = f.func(*nc)\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nWrong result with apart\n```\r\nPython 3.6.0 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Dec 23 2016, 12:22:00) \r\nType \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n\r\nIPython 5.1.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.\r\n?

Expression `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` contains both `a` and `t`\n2. `parallel_poly_from_expr` converts this to polynomials, detecting it as multivariate\n3.

Recursive call to `apart(fc, x=x, ...)` operates on the simplified `-a*t`\n6. Result: Returns `-a*t` instead of proper partial fraction decomposition\n\n**Expected Behavior**: Should factor out `a` and apply partial fraction decomposition to the remaining rational expression, then multiply result by `a`.\n\n## Key Locations Identified for Repair\n\n### Location 1: Lines 120-126 - Multivariate Detection Logic\n**Current Issue**: Treats symbolic coefficients as additional variables\n**Fix Strategy**: Distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients\n\n### Location 2: Lines 80-86 - Polynomial Conversion\n**Current Issue**: `parallel_poly_from_expr` doesn't handle symbolic coefficients properly\n**Fix Strategy**: Preprocess to separate coefficients before polynomial conversion\n\n### Location 3: Lines 128-139 - Polynomial Processing\n**Current Issue**: Doesn't account for factored coefficients in decomposition logic\n**Fix Strategy**: Handle expressions where coefficients have been factored out\n\n### Location 4: Lines 152-188 - `apart_undetermined_coeffs` Function\n**Current Issue**: Assumes input is in standard form without factored coefficients\n**Fix Strategy**: Ensure compatibility with preprocessed expressions\n\n### Location 5: Lines 17-50 - Main Function Entry Point\n**Current Issue**: No initial preprocessing to detect symbolic coefficients\n**Fix Strategy**: Add coefficient detection and factorization before main logic\n\n## Repair Strategy - DEFINED\n**Coordinated Fix Approach**:\n1. **Coefficient Factorization**: Detect symbols that don't appear in denominators and treat them as multiplicative coefficients\n2. **Preprocessing**: Factor out coefficients before polynomial conversion\n3. **Modified Multivariate Handling**: Apply partial fraction decomposition to the core rational expression\n4. **Result Reconstruction**: Multiply decomposed result by factored coefficients\n\n## Technical Implementation Plan\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py`\n\n**Key Functions to Modify**:\n- `apart()` main function (lines 17-149)\n- `apart_undetermined_coeffs()` (lines 152-188)\n- Multivariate detection logic (lines 120-126)\n- Polynomial conversion handling (lines 80-86)\n- Result processing logic (lines 128-139)\n\n## Current Status: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION\n- ✅ **Investigation Phase Complete**: Root cause identified and understood\n- ✅ **Location Analysis Complete**: All 5 key locations identified and analyzed\n- ✅ **Fix Strategy Defined**: Comprehensive repair approach established\n- ✅ **Code Review Complete**: All target code segments reviewed and understood\n\n**Next Action**: Proceed to implementation phase to apply the coordinated fix across all identified locations.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe locations are ready for fixing.

The bug occurs because when an expression contains both a symbolic coefficient (like `a`) and the variable for decomposition (like `t`), the function incorrectly treats it as a multivariate expression and applies cancellation that over-simplifies the result.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 120,\n            \"end_line\": 126\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 80,\n            \"end_line\": 86\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 128,\n            \"end_line\": 139\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 152,\n            \"end_line\": 188\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 17,\n            \"end_line\": 50\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the `apart` function bug, I have identified the root cause and can provide specific repair suggestions for each location. The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic.

Let me analyze each location:\n\n**Location 1 (lines 120-126)**: This is the core issue - when `P.is_multivariate` is True (because the expression contains both `a` and `t`), it calls `f.cancel()` which over-simplifies the expression to `-a*t`, losing the rational structure needed for partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Location 2 (lines 80-86)**: The polynomial conversion step where `parallel_poly_from_expr` treats the expression as multivariate, which triggers the problematic path in Location 1.\n\n**Location 3 (lines 128-139)**: The polynomial processing logic that would handle the decomposition if the expression weren't incorrectly simplified in Location 1.\n\n**Location 4 (lines 152-188)**: The `apart_undetermined_coeffs` function that performs the actual partial fraction decomposition - this works correctly but never gets called with the proper input due to the early simplification.\n\n**Location 5 (lines 17-50)**: The main entry point where preprocessing could be added to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main logic.\n\nThe bug flow is clear: `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` contains both `a` and `t`, so it's detected as multivariate, gets simplified to `-a*t` via cancellation, and then partial fraction decomposition is applied to this simplified form instead of the original rational structure.\n\nThe expected result should be `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (essentially the result when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\nThe suggested fix strategy of factoring out symbolic coefficients before applying partial fraction decomposition is sound and addresses the root cause. All locations are clearly identified and the coordination between them is well-defined.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py lines 120-126\n\nImports

The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression. The final result multiplies the decomposed parts by the factored coefficients.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\n#REFLECT\n\nLooking at the code locations and the bug description, I can see the issue clearly. The problem is that when an expression contains both a symbolic coefficient (like `a`) and the decomposition variable (like `t`), the function incorrectly treats it as multivariate and applies cancellation that over-simplifies the expression.\n\nThe bug flow is:\n1. `bug = a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)` contains both `a` and `t`\n2. `P.is_multivariate` returns True\n3. `f.cancel()` simplifies to `-a*t`, losing the rational structure\n4. Partial fraction decomposition is applied to `-a*t` instead of the original expression\n\nThe expected result should be `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (the same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\nI need to implement a fix that detects symbolic coefficients and factors them out before applying partial fraction decomposition, then multiplies the result back by the coefficients.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines {\"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", \"start_line\": 70, \"end_line\": 90}\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\nTotal lines: 498\nShowing lines 70-90:\n\n  70:     \"\"\"\n  71:     allowed_flags(options, [])\n  72: \n  73:     f = sympify(f)\n  74: \n  75:     if f.is_Atom:\n  76:         return f\n  77:     else:\n  78:         P, Q = f.as_numer_denom()\n  79: \n  80:     _options = options.copy()\n  81:     options = set_defaults(options, extension=True)\n  82:     try:\n  83:         (P, Q), opt = parallel_poly_from_expr((P, Q), x, **options)\n  84:     except PolynomialError as msg:\n  85:         if f.is_commutative:\n  86:             raise PolynomialError(msg)\n  87:         # non-commutative\n  88:         if f.is_Mul:\n  89:             c, nc = f.args_cnc(split_1=False)\n  90:             nc = f.func(*nc)\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines {\"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", \"start_line\": 50, \"end_line\": 85}\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/sympy/sympy/polys/partfrac.py\nTotal lines: 498\nShowing lines 50-85:\n\n  50: \n  51:     >>> apart(y/(x**2 + x + 1), x)\n  52:     y/(x**2 + x + 1)\n  53: \n  54:     You can choose Bronstein's algorithm by setting ``full=True``:\n  55: \n  56:     >>> apart(y/(x**2 + x + 1), x, full=True)\n  57:     RootSum(_w**2 + _w + 1, Lambda(_a, (-2*_a*y/3 - y/3)/(-_a + x)))\n  58: \n  59:     Calling ``doit()`` yields a human-readable result:\n  60: \n  61:     >>> apart(y/(x**2 + x + 1), x, full=True).doit()\n  62:     (-y/3 - 2*y*(-1/2 - sqrt(3)*I/2)/3)/(x + 1/2 + sqrt(3)*I/2) + (-y/3 -\n  63:         2*y*(-1/2 + sqrt(3)*I/2)/3)/(x + 1/2 - sqrt(3)*I/2)\n  64: \n  65: \n  66:     See Also\n  67:     ========\n  68: \n  69:     apart_list, assemble_partfrac_list\n  70:     \"\"\"\n  71:     allowed_flags(options, [])\n  72: \n  73:     f = sympify(f)\n  74: \n  75:     if f.is_Atom:\n  76:         return f\n  77:     else:\n  78:         P, Q = f.as_numer_denom()\n  79: \n  80:     _options = options.copy()\n  81:     options = set_defaults(options, extension=True)\n  82:     try:\n  83:         (P, Q), opt = parallel_poly_from_expr((P, Q), x, **options)\n  84:     except PolynomialError as msg:\n  85:         if f.is_commutative:\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nWrong result with apart\n```\r\nPython 3.6.0 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Dec 23 2016, 12:22:00) \r\nType \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n\r\nIPython 5.1.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.\r\n?

The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression. The final result multiplies the decomposed parts by the factored coefficients.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression. The final result multiplies the decomposed parts by the factored coefficients.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression. The final result multiplies the decomposed parts by the factored coefficients.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression. The final result multiplies the decomposed parts by the factored coefficients.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression.

The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression. The final result multiplies the decomposed parts by the factored coefficients.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression.

Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression. The final result multiplies the decomposed parts by the factored coefficients.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

The bug occurs because expressions with symbolic coefficients (like `a`) are incorrectly treated as multivariate, leading to over-simplification instead of proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Root Cause**: When `bug.apart(t)` is called on `a * (-t + (-t + 1) * (2 * t - 1)) / (2 * t - 1)`, the function detects it as multivariate (containing both `a` and `t`), applies cancellation that simplifies it to `-a*t`, and then fails to perform proper partial fraction decomposition.\n\n**Expected Result**: Should return `-a*t + a/2 - a/(2*(2*t - 1))` (same structure as when `a=1` but with `a` factored out).\n\n1. **[Lines 120-126]**: Modify the multivariate detection logic to distinguish between true multivariate expressions and expressions with symbolic coefficients. Before checking `P.is_multivariate`, attempt to factor out coefficients that don't involve the decomposition variable `x`. If successful factorization occurs, apply `apart` to the factored part and multiply by the coefficient.\n\n2. **[Lines 80-86]**: Enhance the polynomial conversion step in `parallel_poly_from_expr` to better handle symbolic coefficients. Add preprocessing to identify and separate coefficients from the main rational expression before polynomial conversion, ensuring that symbolic coefficients are preserved during the conversion process.\n\n3. **[Lines 128-139]**: Modify the polynomial processing logic to handle cases where symbolic coefficients have been factored out. Ensure that the `apart_undetermined_coeffs` method receives the properly factored expression and that results are correctly scaled by any factored coefficients.\n\n4. **[Lines 152-188]**: Update `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to handle expressions that may have been preprocessed to separate symbolic coefficients. Ensure the undetermined coefficients method can work with the core rational expression and that results are properly formatted for multiplication with factored coefficients.\n\n5. **[Lines 17-50]**: Add initial preprocessing in the main `apart` function to detect and factor out symbolic coefficients before the main decomposition logic. This should include identifying symbols that don't appear in denominators and can be treated as multiplicative coefficients rather than variables requiring multivariate handling.\n\n**Coordination**: These fixes work together by implementing a coefficient factorization strategy: locations 1 and 5 detect and factor out coefficients, location 2 ensures proper polynomial conversion of the factored expression, location 3 manages the decomposition process, and location 4 performs the actual partial fraction decomposition on the simplified expression. The final result multiplies the decomposed parts by the factored coefficients.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",
