Migration is atomic (`migration.atomic`)\n2. Schema editor can rollback DDL (`connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`)\n\n## Key Technical Details\n- **File to Fix**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Line to Modify**: Line 59\n- **Current Code**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n- **Required Fix**: Must incorporate both `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n## Actions Taken\n1. **Project Structure Exploration**: Successfully navigated to the Django project structure and located the `sqlmigrate.py` command file\n2. **Bug Identification**: Found the exact problematic line (59) in the sqlmigrate command\n3. **Code Analysis**: Reviewed the complete sqlmigrate command implementation (65 lines total)\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Bug Located**: Identified the exact line causing the issue\n- ✅ **Problem Understood**: Clear understanding of the logic flaw\n- 🔄 **Next Steps Needed**:\n  1. Examine migration executor code to understand the correct logic pattern\n  2. Implement the fix by modifying line 59 to check both conditions\n  3. Locate and examine the test file (`tests/migrations/test_commands.py`)\n  4. Add appropriate test case to verify the fix\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Successfully navigated Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Retrieved complete sqlmigrate.py file content\n- `search_code_with_context`: Attempted to find related code (no matches in migrations directory)\n\n## Next Actions Required\n1. Search for migration executor implementation to understand the correct conditional logic\n2. Modify line 59 in sqlmigrate.py to include both conditions\n3. Locate and examine the test file structure\n4. Implement test case to verify the bug fix works correctly\n\nThe bug is well-defined and the location is confirmed.

Migration is atomic (`migration.atomic`)\n2. Schema editor can rollback DDL (`connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`)\n\n## Key Technical Details\n- **File to Fix**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Line to Modify**: Line 59\n- **Current Code**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n- **Required Fix**: Must incorporate both `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n## Actions Taken\n1. **Project Structure Exploration**: Successfully navigated to the Django project structure and located the `sqlmigrate.py` command file\n2. **Bug Identification**: Found the exact problematic line (59) in the sqlmigrate command\n3. **Code Analysis**: Reviewed the complete sqlmigrate command implementation (65 lines total)\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Bug Located**: Identified the exact line causing the issue\n- ✅ **Problem Understood**: Clear understanding of the logic flaw\n- 🔄 **Next Steps Needed**:\n  1. Examine migration executor code to understand the correct logic pattern\n  2. Implement the fix by modifying line 59 to check both conditions\n  3. Locate and examine the test file (`tests/migrations/test_commands.py`)\n  4. Add appropriate test case to verify the fix\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Successfully navigated Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Retrieved complete sqlmigrate.py file content\n- `search_code_with_context`: Attempted to find related code (no matches in migrations directory)\n\n## Next Actions Required\n1. Search for migration executor implementation to understand the correct conditional logic\n2. Modify line 59 in sqlmigrate.py to include both conditions\n3. Locate and examine the test file structure\n4. Implement test case to verify the bug fix works correctly\n\nThe bug is well-defined and the location is confirmed.

Migration is atomic (`migration.atomic`)\n2. Schema editor can rollback DDL (`connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`)\n\n## Key Technical Details\n- **File to Fix**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Line to Modify**: Line 59\n- **Current Code**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n- **Required Fix**: Must incorporate both `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n## Actions Taken\n1. **Project Structure Exploration**: Successfully navigated to the Django project structure and located the `sqlmigrate.py` command file\n2. **Bug Identification**: Found the exact problematic line (59) in the sqlmigrate command\n3. **Code Analysis**: Reviewed the complete sqlmigrate command implementation (65 lines total)\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Bug Located**: Identified the exact line causing the issue\n- ✅ **Problem Understood**: Clear understanding of the logic flaw\n- 🔄 **Next Steps Needed**:\n  1. Examine migration executor code to understand the correct logic pattern\n  2. Implement the fix by modifying line 59 to check both conditions\n  3. Locate and examine the test file (`tests/migrations/test_commands.py`)\n  4. Add appropriate test case to verify the fix\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Successfully navigated Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Retrieved complete sqlmigrate.py file content\n- `search_code_with_context`: Attempted to find related code (no matches in migrations directory)\n\n## Next Actions Required\n1. Search for migration executor implementation to understand the correct conditional logic\n2. Modify line 59 in sqlmigrate.py to include both conditions\n3. Locate and examine the test file structure\n4. Implement test case to verify the bug fix works correctly\n\nThe bug is well-defined and the location is confirmed.

Migration is atomic (`migration.atomic`)\n2. Schema editor can rollback DDL (`connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`)\n\n## Key Technical Details - VERIFIED\n- **File to Fix**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Line to Modify**: Line 59\n- **Current Code**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n- **Required Fix**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n- **Connection Availability**: Confirmed at line 37: `executor = MigrationExecutor(connection)`\n\n## Pattern Analysis - DISCOVERED\nFound the correct pattern used throughout Django's codebase in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at line 97:\n\n```python\nself.atomic_migration = self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic\n```\n\nThis confirms the exact logic that should be implemented in the sqlmigrate command.\n\n## Test Context - IDENTIFIED\nLocated existing test structure in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`:\n- **Existing test**: `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration` (lines 607-617) tests non-atomic migrations\n- **Required addition**: New test method that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` and verifies no BEGIN/COMMIT wrappers are added\n\n## Actions Taken - COMPLETE\n1. ✅ **Project Structure Exploration**: Successfully navigated to Django project structure\n2. ✅ **Bug Location Confirmed**: Found exact problematic line (59) in sqlmigrate command\n3. ✅ **Code Pattern Analysis**: Discovered correct implementation pattern from schema.py\n4. ✅ **Connection Availability Verified**: Confirmed `connection` object is accessible at line 37\n5. ✅ **Test Structure Identified**: Located test file and existing similar test cases\n6. ✅ **Root Cause Analysis Complete**: Full understanding of the logic flaw and required fix\n\n## PROPOSE LOCATION - Vulnerable Code Locations\n\n**Location 1: Main Bug Fix (CRITICAL)**\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Lines**: 59–59\n- **Current Vulnerable Code**: \n  ```python\n  self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n  ```\n- **Security Issue**: Missing check for database DDL rollback capability\n- **Required Fix**: \n  ```python\n  self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n  ```\n\n**Location 2: Test Coverage Gap (MEDIUM)**\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n- **Lines**: After line 618 (following existing test)\n- **Issue**: Missing test case to verify the fix works correctly\n- **Required Addition**: New test method that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False`\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n1. **Single Line Fix**: Modify line 59 to include both conditions using the established Django pattern\n2. **Test Addition**: Add test case similar to existing `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration` but mocking DDL rollback capability\n3. **Verification**: Ensure fix follows the same logic pattern used by migration executor and schema editor\n\n## Current Status - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION\n- ✅ **Bug Identified and Confirmed**: Exact line and logic flaw understood\n- ✅ **Solution Pattern Discovered**: Found correct implementation from Django codebase\n- ✅ **Context Verified**: Connection object availability and test structure confirmed\n- 🔄 **Next Steps**: \n  1. Implement the single-line fix at line 59\n  2. Add comprehensive test case to verify the fix\n  3. Test the implementation to ensure it works correctly\n\nThe bug is fully analyzed and ready for implementation. The fix requires changing one line but must follow Django's established pattern for handling transactional DDL operations.",

Schema editor can rollback DDL (`connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`)\n\n## Key Technical Details - VERIFIED\n- **File to Fix**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Line to Modify**: Line 59\n- **Current Code**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n- **Required Fix**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n- **Connection Availability**: Confirmed at line 37: `executor = MigrationExecutor(connection)`\n\n## Pattern Analysis - DISCOVERED\nFound the correct pattern used throughout Django's codebase in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at line 97:\n\n```python\nself.atomic_migration = self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic\n```\n\nThis confirms the exact logic that should be implemented in the sqlmigrate command.\n\n## Test Context - IDENTIFIED\nLocated existing test structure in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`:\n- **Existing test**: `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration` (lines 607-617) tests non-atomic migrations\n- **Required addition**: New test method that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` and verifies no BEGIN/COMMIT wrappers are added\n\n## Actions Taken - COMPLETE\n1. ✅ **Project Structure Exploration**: Successfully navigated to Django project structure\n2. ✅ **Bug Location Confirmed**: Found exact problematic line (59) in sqlmigrate command\n3. ✅ **Code Pattern Analysis**: Discovered correct implementation pattern from schema.py\n4. ✅ **Connection Availability Verified**: Confirmed `connection` object is accessible at line 37\n5. ✅ **Test Structure Identified**: Located test file and existing similar test cases\n6. ✅ **Root Cause Analysis Complete**: Full understanding of the logic flaw and required fix\n\n## PROPOSE LOCATION - Vulnerable Code Locations\n\n**Location 1: Main Bug Fix (CRITICAL)**\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Lines**: 59–59\n- **Current Vulnerable Code**: \n  ```python\n  self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n  ```\n- **Security Issue**: Missing check for database DDL rollback capability\n- **Required Fix**: \n  ```python\n  self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n  ```\n\n**Location 2: Test Coverage Gap (MEDIUM)**\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n- **Lines**: After line 618 (following existing test)\n- **Issue**: Missing test case to verify the fix works correctly\n- **Required Addition**: New test method that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False`\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n1. **Single Line Fix**: Modify line 59 to include both conditions using the established Django pattern\n2. **Test Addition**: Add test case similar to existing `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration` but mocking DDL rollback capability\n3. **Verification**: Ensure fix follows the same logic pattern used by migration executor and schema editor\n\n## Current Status - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION\n- ✅ **Bug Identified and Confirmed**: Exact line and logic flaw understood\n- ✅ **Solution Pattern Discovered**: Found correct implementation from Django codebase\n- ✅ **Context Verified**: Connection object availability and test structure confirmed\n- 🔄 **Next Steps**: \n  1. Implement the single-line fix at line 59\n  2. Add comprehensive test case to verify the fix\n  3. Test the implementation to ensure it works correctly\n\nThe bug is fully analyzed and ready for implementation. The fix requires changing one line but must follow Django's established pattern for handling transactional DDL operations.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and the required fix. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n## Bug Analysis:\n1. **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, line 59\n2. **Current problematic code**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n3. **Issue**: Only checks if migration is atomic, but should also check if database supports DDL rollback\n4. **Correct pattern** (from schema.py): `self.atomic_migration = self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic`\n\n## Required Fix:\nLine 59 should be changed to:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n```\n\n## Test Context:\n- There's already a test `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration` (lines 607-617) that tests non-atomic migrations\n- The problem description suggests adding a similar test that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False`\n\n## Key Locations to Fix:\n1. **Line 59** in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` - the main bug fix\n2. **Test file** `/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py` - needs a new test case\n\nLet me examine the exact context around line 59 to understand the complete fix needed.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\", \"start_line\": 56, \"end_line\": 62 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\nTotal lines: 65\nShowing lines 56-62:\n\n  56:         targets = [(app_label, migration.name)]\n  57: \n  58:         # Show begin/end around output only for atomic migrations\n  59:         self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n  60: \n  61:         # Make a plan that represents just the requested migrations and show SQL\n  62:         # for it\n\nBased on my analysis of the codebase, I have identified the exact locations where the bug needs to be fixed. Let me provide the precise line ranges:\n\n## Bug Analysis Summary\n\nThe issue is in Django's `sqlmigrate` management command where it incorrectly wraps SQL output in BEGIN/COMMIT transactions even when the database doesn't support transactional DDL operations.\n\n**Root Cause**: The current logic at line 59 only checks `migration.atomic` but should also verify `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`, just like the migration executor does.\n\n## Vulnerable Code Locations\n\n**Location 1: Main Bug Fix**\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Lines**: 59–59\n- **Current Code**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n- **Issue**: Missing check for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n- **Required Fix**: Change to `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n**Location 2: Test Coverage Addition**\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n- **Lines**: 618–618 (after existing test)\n- **Issue**: Missing test case to verify the fix works correctly\n- **Required Addition**: New test method that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` and verifies no BEGIN/COMMIT wrappers are added\n\n## Technical Context\n\nFrom my analysis:\n1. **Line 37** shows `connection` object is available: `executor = MigrationExecutor(connection)`\n2. **Schema editor pattern** (found in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py` line 97): `self.atomic_migration = self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic`\n3. **Existing test structure** shows similar test at lines 607-617 for non-atomic migrations\n\nThe fix requires changing a single line but following the established pattern used throughout Django's migration system where both conditions must be true for transactional DDL wrapping.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nsqlmigrate wraps it's outpout in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Charette)\n\t \nThe migration executor only adds the outer BEGIN/COMMIT ​if the migration is atomic and ​the schema editor can rollback DDL but the current sqlmigrate logic only takes migration.atomic into consideration.\nThe issue can be addressed by\nChanging sqlmigrate ​assignment of self.output_transaction to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl as well.\nAdding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py based on ​an existing test for non-atomic migrations that mocks connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False instead of overdidding MIGRATION_MODULES to point to a non-atomic migration.\nI marked the ticket as easy picking because I included the above guidelines but feel free to uncheck it if you deem it inappropriate.\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list.

Schema editor can rollback DDL (`connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`)\n\n## Key Technical Details - VERIFIED\n- **File to Fix**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Line to Modify**: Line 59\n- **Current Code**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n- **Required Fix**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n- **Connection Availability**: Confirmed at line 37: `executor = MigrationExecutor(connection)`\n\n## Pattern Analysis - DISCOVERED\nFound the correct pattern used throughout Django's codebase in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at line 97:\n\n```python\nself.atomic_migration = self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic\n```\n\nThis confirms the exact logic that should be implemented in the sqlmigrate command.\n\n## Test Context - IDENTIFIED\nLocated existing test structure in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`:\n- **Existing test**: `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration` (lines 607-617) tests non-atomic migrations\n- **Required addition**: New test method that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` and verifies no BEGIN/COMMIT wrappers are added\n\n## Actions Taken - COMPLETE\n1. ✅ **Project Structure Exploration**: Successfully navigated to Django project structure\n2. ✅ **Bug Location Confirmed**: Found exact problematic line (59) in sqlmigrate command\n3. ✅ **Code Pattern Analysis**: Discovered correct implementation pattern from schema.py\n4. ✅ **Connection Availability Verified**: Confirmed `connection` object is accessible at line 37\n5. ✅ **Test Structure Identified**: Located test file and existing similar test cases\n6. ✅ **Root Cause Analysis Complete**: Full understanding of the logic flaw and required fix\n\n## PROPOSE LOCATION - Vulnerable Code Locations\n\n**Location 1: Main Bug Fix (CRITICAL)**\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Lines**: 59–59\n- **Current Vulnerable Code**: \n  ```python\n  self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n  ```\n- **Security Issue**: Missing check for database DDL rollback capability\n- **Required Fix**: \n  ```python\n  self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n  ```\n\n**Location 2: Test Coverage Gap (MEDIUM)**\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n- **Lines**: After line 618 (following existing test)\n- **Issue**: Missing test case to verify the fix works correctly\n- **Required Addition**: New test method that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False`\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n1. **Single Line Fix**: Modify line 59 to include both conditions using the established Django pattern\n2. **Test Addition**: Add test case similar to existing `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration` but mocking DDL rollback capability\n3. **Verification**: Ensure fix follows the same logic pattern used by migration executor and schema editor\n\n## Current Status - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION\n- ✅ **Bug Identified and Confirmed**: Exact line and logic flaw understood\n- ✅ **Solution Pattern Discovered**: Found correct implementation from Django codebase\n- ✅ **Context Verified**: Connection object availability and test structure confirmed\n- 🔄 **Next Steps**: \n  1. Implement the single-line fix at line 59\n  2. Add comprehensive test case to verify the fix\n  3. Test the implementation to ensure it works correctly\n\nThe bug is fully analyzed and ready for implementation. The fix requires changing one line but must follow Django's established pattern for handling transactional DDL operations.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\nStart line: 59\nEnd line: 59\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py\nStart line: 618\nEnd line: 618\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and the required fix.

Migration is atomic (`migration.atomic`)\n2. Schema editor can rollback DDL (`connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`)\n\n## Key Technical Details - VERIFIED\n- **File to Fix**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Line to Modify**: Line 59\n- **Current Code**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n- **Required Fix**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n- **Connection Availability**: Confirmed at line 37: `executor = MigrationExecutor(connection)`\n\n## Pattern Analysis - DISCOVERED\nFound the correct pattern used throughout Django's codebase in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at line 97:\n\n```python\nself.atomic_migration = self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic\n```\n\nThis confirms the exact logic that should be implemented in the sqlmigrate command.\n\n## Test Context - IDENTIFIED\nLocated existing test structure in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`:\n- **Existing test**: `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration` (lines 607-617) tests non-atomic migrations\n- **Required addition**: New test method that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` and verifies no BEGIN/COMMIT wrappers are added\n\n## Actions Taken - COMPLETE\n1. ✅ **Project Structure Exploration**: Successfully navigated to Django project structure\n2. ✅ **Bug Location Confirmed**: Found exact problematic line (59) in sqlmigrate command\n3. ✅ **Code Pattern Analysis**: Discovered correct implementation pattern from schema.py\n4. ✅ **Connection Availability Verified**: Confirmed `connection` object is accessible at line 37\n5. ✅ **Test Structure Identified**: Located test file and existing similar test cases\n6. ✅ **Root Cause Analysis Complete**: Full understanding of the logic flaw and required fix\n\n## PROPOSE LOCATION - Vulnerable Code Locations\n\n**Location 1: Main Bug Fix (CRITICAL)**\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Lines**: 59–59\n- **Current Vulnerable Code**: \n  ```python\n  self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n  ```\n- **Security Issue**: Missing check for database DDL rollback capability\n- **Required Fix**: \n  ```python\n  self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n  ```\n\n**Location 2: Test Coverage Gap (MEDIUM)**\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n- **Lines**: After line 618 (following existing test)\n- **Issue**: Missing test case to verify the fix works correctly\n- **Required Addition**: New test method that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False`\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n1. **Single Line Fix**: Modify line 59 to include both conditions using the established Django pattern\n2. **Test Addition**: Add test case similar to existing `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration` but mocking DDL rollback capability\n3. **Verification**: Ensure fix follows the same logic pattern used by migration executor and schema editor\n\n## Current Status - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION\n- ✅ **Bug Identified and Confirmed**: Exact line and logic flaw understood\n- ✅ **Solution Pattern Discovered**: Found correct implementation from Django codebase\n- ✅ **Context Verified**: Connection object availability and test structure confirmed\n- 🔄 **Next Steps**: \n  1. Implement the single-line fix at line 59\n  2. Add comprehensive test case to verify the fix\n  3. Test the implementation to ensure it works correctly\n\nThe bug is fully analyzed and ready for implementation.

The `connection` object is already available from line 37 (`executor = MigrationExecutor(connection)`), so this change maintains consistency with Django's established approach to handling transactional DDL operations.\n\n## Location 2: Test Coverage Addition (Supporting)\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n**Line**: 618 (after existing test)\n\n**Suggested Addition**:\n```python\n@mock.patch('django.db.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl', False)\ndef test_sqlmigrate_for_non_ddl_rollback_database(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transaction wrappers aren't shown for databases that don't support DDL rollback,\n    even for atomic migrations.\n    \"\"\"\n    out = io.StringIO()\n    call_command(\"sqlmigrate\", \"migrations\", \"0001\", stdout=out)\n    output = out.getvalue().lower()\n    queries = [q.strip() for q in output.splitlines()]\n    if connection.ops.start_transaction_sql():\n        self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.start_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)\n    self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.end_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)\n```\n\n**Rationale**: This test mirrors the existing `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration` but specifically tests the DDL rollback capability condition. It uses the `mock` module (already imported at line 6) to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False`, ensuring that even atomic migrations don't get wrapped in BEGIN/COMMIT when the database doesn't support DDL rollback.\n\n## Interconnection Analysis\nThese two fixes work together to completely resolve the bug:\n\n1. **Location 1** implements the core logic fix that aligns sqlmigrate behavior with the migration executor\n2. **Location 2** provides test coverage to verify the fix works correctly and prevents regression\n\nThe test in Location 2 directly validates that the logic change in Location 1 produces the expected behavior, ensuring that both conditions (`migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`) must be true for transaction wrappers to appear in the SQL output.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py lines 59-59\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py lines 618-618\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nsqlmigrate wraps it's outpout in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Charette)\n\t \nThe migration executor only adds the outer BEGIN/COMMIT ​if the migration is atomic and ​the schema editor can rollback DDL but the current sqlmigrate logic only takes migration.atomic into consideration.\nThe issue can be addressed by\nChanging sqlmigrate ​assignment of self.output_transaction to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl as well.\nAdding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py based on ​an existing test for non-atomic migrations that mocks connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False instead of overdidding MIGRATION_MODULES to point to a non-atomic migration.\nI marked the ticket as easy picking because I included the above guidelines but feel free to uncheck it if you deem it inappropriate.\n",

The `connection` object is already available from line 37 (`executor = MigrationExecutor(connection)`), so this change maintains consistency with Django's established approach to handling transactional DDL operations.\n\n## Location 2: Test Coverage Addition (Supporting)\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n**Line**: 618 (after existing test)\n\n**Suggested Addition**:\n```python\n@mock.patch('django.db.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl', False)\ndef test_sqlmigrate_for_non_ddl_rollback_database(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transaction wrappers aren't shown for databases that don't support DDL rollback,\n    even for atomic migrations.\n    \"\"\"\n    out = io.StringIO()\n    call_command(\"sqlmigrate\", \"migrations\", \"0001\", stdout=out)\n    output = out.getvalue().lower()\n    queries = [q.strip() for q in output.splitlines()]\n    if connection.ops.start_transaction_sql():\n        self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.start_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)\n    self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.end_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)\n```\n\n**Rationale**: This test mirrors the existing `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration` but specifically tests the DDL rollback capability condition. It uses the `mock` module (already imported at line 6) to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False`, ensuring that even atomic migrations don't get wrapped in BEGIN/COMMIT when the database doesn't support DDL rollback.\n\n## Interconnection Analysis\nThese two fixes work together to completely resolve the bug:\n\n1. **Location 1** implements the core logic fix that aligns sqlmigrate behavior with the migration executor\n2. **Location 2** provides test coverage to verify the fix works correctly and prevents regression\n\nThe test in Location 2 directly validates that the logic change in Location 1 produces the expected behavior, ensuring that both conditions (`migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`) must be true for transaction wrappers to appear in the SQL output.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",
