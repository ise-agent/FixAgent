Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method, specifically at lines 1240-1248.\n\n2. **Current Behavior**: \n   - When `emit=True`, the callback is processed for the primary axis (line 1241)\n   - For shared axes, `_set_lim` is called with `emit=False` (line 1246), preventing callbacks from being emitted on shared axes\n\n3. **Problem**: Users expect `xlim_changed` callbacks to be triggered on all shared axes when limits change, but currently only the primary axis emits the callback.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The `emit=False` parameter in line 1246 prevents shared axes from processing their callbacks.\n\n5. **Note**: The problem description mentions the bug is in `_base.py` but from my analysis, the actual implementation that needs fixing is in `axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` delegates to `axis._set_lim`.\n\nBased on my analysis, I can now identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. The bug is in the `_set_lim` method where shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted.\n\n**Locations to fix:**\n\n1. **Primary location (lines 1240-1248)**: The main logic where shared axes are processed with `emit=False`\n2. **Specific line 1246**: Where `emit=False` is explicitly passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion. This can be achieved by either:\n- Changing the logic to emit callbacks for shared axes\n- Moving callback processing outside the emit condition\n- Adding a mechanism to prevent recursion while still emitting callbacks\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**",

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method, specifically at lines 1240-1248.\n\n2. **Current Behavior**: \n   - When `emit=True`, the callback is processed for the primary axis (line 1241)\n   - For shared axes, `_set_lim` is called with `emit=False` (line 1246), preventing callbacks from being emitted on shared axes\n\n3. **Problem**: Users expect `xlim_changed` callbacks to be triggered on all shared axes when limits change, but currently only the primary axis emits the callback.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The `emit=False` parameter in line 1246 prevents shared axes from processing their callbacks.\n\n5. **Note**: The problem description mentions the bug is in `_base.py` but from my analysis, the actual implementation that needs fixing is in `axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` delegates to `axis._set_lim`.\n\nBased on my analysis, I can now identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. The bug is in the `_set_lim` method where shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted.\n\n**Locations to fix:**\n\n1. **Primary location (lines 1240-1248)**: The main logic where shared axes are processed with `emit=False`\n2. **Specific line 1246**: Where `emit=False` is explicitly passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion. This can be achieved by either:\n- Changing the logic to emit callbacks for shared axes\n- Moving callback processing outside the emit condition\n- Adding a mechanism to prevent recursion while still emitting callbacks\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nxlim_changed not emitted on shared axis\n<!--To help us understand and resolve your issue, please fill out the form to the best of your ability.-->\r\n<!--You can feel free to delete the sections that do not apply.-->\r\n\r\n### Bug report\r\n\r\n**Bug summary**\r\n\r\nWhen an axis is shared with another its registered \"xlim_changed\" callbacks does not get called when the change is induced by a shared axis (via sharex=). \r\n\r\nIn _base.py the set_xlim for sibling axis are called with emit=False:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmatplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py:\r\n\r\n/.../\r\ndef set_xlim(...)\r\n/.../\r\n        if emit:\r\n            self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)\r\n            # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one\r\n            for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):\r\n                if other is not self:\r\n                    other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,\r\n                                   emit=False, auto=auto)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm very new to matplotlib, so perhaps there is a good reason for this? emit=False seems to disable both continued \"inheritance\" of axis (why?) and triggering of change callbacks (looking at the code above).\r\n\r\nIt seems like one would at least want to trigger the xlim_changed callbacks as they would be intended to react to any change in axis limits.\r\n\r\nEdit: Setting emit=True seems to introduce a recursion issue (not sure why but as inheritance seems to be passed along anyway it doesn't really matter). Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list.

When axis limits are changed on a primary axis, the callback is emitted correctly. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed, preventing the `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on shared axes.\n\nThe bug report mentions the issue is in `_base.py`, but the actual implementation that delegates to the axis-level logic is in `axis.py`. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` calls `self.xaxis._set_lim()`, which contains the problematic logic.\n\n**Key Locations:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1240,\n            \"end_line\": 1248\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis location contains the core logic where:\n1.

Line 1246: The specific line where `emit=False` is passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion, as suggested in the bug report by moving the callback processing outside the emit condition or implementing a proper recursion prevention mechanism.",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Bug Analysis and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the matplotlib project related to the `xlim_changed` callback not being emitted on shared axes when axis limits are changed.\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib`\n- **Result**: Identified the matplotlib project structure with key directories including `lib/`, `src/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. Code Analysis - Axes Implementation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `set_xlim` method (lines 3570-3646) which delegates to `self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)`\n\n### 3. Code Analysis - Axis Implementation  \n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `_set_lim` method (lines 1179-1251) which contains the core logic for setting axis limits\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### Current Behavior (Lines 1240-1248 in axis.py):\n```python\nif emit:\n    self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n    # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n    for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n        if other is not self.axes:\n            other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)  # ← BUG: emit=False\n```\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. When `set_xlim` is called on the primary axis with `emit=True`, the callback is processed correctly\n2. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed\n3. This prevents the `xlim_changed` callback from being emitted on shared axes\n4. Users expecting callbacks on all shared axes don't receive them\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Method Flow:\n1. `Axes.set_xlim()` → calls `Axis._set_lim()` with `emit` parameter\n2. `Axis._set_lim()` processes the callback if `emit=True`\n3. For shared axes, it calls `_set_lim()` again but with `emit=False`\n\n### Current Implementation Logic:\n- The `emit=False` for shared axes appears to be intentional to avoid duplicate callback processing\n- However, this creates inconsistent behavior where callbacks aren't fired for shared axes\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n- ✅ Located the bug in the `_set_lim` method in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- ✅ Identified the specific line causing the issue (line 1246: `emit=False`)\n- ✅ Understood the method flow and callback processing mechanism\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. **Fix Implementation**: Modify the shared axes callback logic to emit callbacks appropriately\n2. **Test the Fix**: Create test cases to verify the fix works correctly\n3. **Consider Edge Cases**: Ensure the fix doesn't cause duplicate callbacks or other issues\n4. **Validate**: Test with actual matplotlib usage scenarios\n\n## Recommended Fix Strategy\n\nThe bug fix should modify lines 1242-1248 in `axis.py` to ensure callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding duplicates. The solution likely involves:\n1. Processing callbacks for shared axes with `emit=True`\n2. Potentially adding logic to prevent duplicate callback processing\n3.

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method, specifically at lines 1240-1248.\n\n2. **Current Behavior**: \n   - When `emit=True`, the callback is processed for the primary axis (line 1241)\n   - For shared axes, `_set_lim` is called with `emit=False` (line 1246), preventing callbacks from being emitted on shared axes\n\n3. **Problem**: Users expect `xlim_changed` callbacks to be triggered on all shared axes when limits change, but currently only the primary axis emits the callback.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The `emit=False` parameter in line 1246 prevents shared axes from processing their callbacks.\n\n5. **Note**: The problem description mentions the bug is in `_base.py` but from my analysis, the actual implementation that needs fixing is in `axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` delegates to `axis._set_lim`.\n\nBased on my analysis, I can now identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. The bug is in the `_set_lim` method where shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted.\n\n**Locations to fix:**\n\n1. **Primary location (lines 1240-1248)**: The main logic where shared axes are processed with `emit=False`\n2. **Specific line 1246**: Where `emit=False` is explicitly passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion. This can be achieved by either:\n- Changing the logic to emit callbacks for shared axes\n- Moving callback processing outside the emit condition\n- Adding a mechanism to prevent recursion while still emitting callbacks\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug report and code investigation, I can identify the root cause and locations that need to be fixed.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the `_set_lim` method in `axis.py` (not `_base.py` as mentioned in the bug report). When axis limits are changed on a primary axis, the callback is emitted correctly. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed, preventing the `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on shared axes.\n\nThe bug report mentions the issue is in `_base.py`, but the actual implementation that delegates to the axis-level logic is in `axis.py`. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` calls `self.xaxis._set_lim()`, which contains the problematic logic.\n\n**Key Locations:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1240,\n            \"end_line\": 1248\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis location contains the core logic where:\n1. Line 1241: The callback is processed for the primary axis when `emit=True`\n2. Lines 1242-1248: Shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted\n3. Line 1246: The specific line where `emit=False` is passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion, as suggested in the bug report by moving the callback processing outside the emit condition or implementing a proper recursion prevention mechanism.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nxlim_changed not emitted on shared axis\n<!--To help us understand and resolve your issue, please fill out the form to the best of your ability.-->\r\n<!--You can feel free to delete the sections that do not apply.-->\r\n\r\n### Bug report\r\n\r\n**Bug summary**\r\n\r\nWhen an axis is shared with another its registered \"xlim_changed\" callbacks does not get called when the change is induced by a shared axis (via sharex=). \r\n\r\nIn _base.py the set_xlim for sibling axis are called with emit=False:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmatplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py:\r\n\r\n/.../\r\ndef set_xlim(...)\r\n/.../\r\n        if emit:\r\n            self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)\r\n            # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one\r\n            for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):\r\n                if other is not self:\r\n                    other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,\r\n                                   emit=False, auto=auto)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm very new to matplotlib, so perhaps there is a good reason for this? emit=False seems to disable both continued \"inheritance\" of axis (why?) and triggering of change callbacks (looking at the code above).\r\n\r\nIt seems like one would at least want to trigger the xlim_changed callbacks as they would be intended to react to any change in axis limits.\r\n\r\nEdit: Setting emit=True seems to introduce a recursion issue (not sure why but as inheritance seems to be passed along anyway it doesn't really matter). Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture. The bug report confirms my analysis and provides additional context:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The issue is actually in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` in the `set_xlim` method, not in `axis.py` as I initially thought.\n\n2. **Problem**: When `set_xlim` is called on a primary axis, shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on those shared axes.\n\n3. **User's Observation**: The user noted that setting `emit=True` causes recursion issues, but moving the callback processing outside the `if emit:` statement solves the problem.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The callback processing is inside the `if emit:` block, and shared axes are called with `emit=False`, so they never process their callbacks.\n\nLet me examine the actual `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` to understand the current implementation and provide precise suggestions.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", \"start_line\": 3570, \"end_line\": 3650 }",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Bug Analysis and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the matplotlib project related to the `xlim_changed` callback not being emitted on shared axes when axis limits are changed.\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib`\n- **Result**: Identified the matplotlib project structure with key directories including `lib/`, `src/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. Code Analysis - Axes Implementation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `set_xlim` method (lines 3570-3646) which delegates to `self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)`\n\n### 3. Code Analysis - Axis Implementation  \n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `_set_lim` method (lines 1179-1251) which contains the core logic for setting axis limits\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### Current Behavior (Lines 1240-1248 in axis.py):\n```python\nif emit:\n    self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n    # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n    for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n        if other is not self.axes:\n            other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)  # ← BUG: emit=False\n```\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. When `set_xlim` is called on the primary axis with `emit=True`, the callback is processed correctly\n2. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed\n3. This prevents the `xlim_changed` callback from being emitted on shared axes\n4. Users expecting callbacks on all shared axes don't receive them\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Method Flow:\n1. `Axes.set_xlim()` → calls `Axis._set_lim()` with `emit` parameter\n2. `Axis._set_lim()` processes the callback if `emit=True`\n3. For shared axes, it calls `_set_lim()` again but with `emit=False`\n\n### Current Implementation Logic:\n- The `emit=False` for shared axes appears to be intentional to avoid duplicate callback processing\n- However, this creates inconsistent behavior where callbacks aren't fired for shared axes\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n- ✅ Located the bug in the `_set_lim` method in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- ✅ Identified the specific line causing the issue (line 1246: `emit=False`)\n- ✅ Understood the method flow and callback processing mechanism\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. **Fix Implementation**: Modify the shared axes callback logic to emit callbacks appropriately\n2. **Test the Fix**: Create test cases to verify the fix works correctly\n3. **Consider Edge Cases**: Ensure the fix doesn't cause duplicate callbacks or other issues\n4. **Validate**: Test with actual matplotlib usage scenarios\n\n## Recommended Fix Strategy\n\nThe bug fix should modify lines 1242-1248 in `axis.py` to ensure callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding duplicates. The solution likely involves:\n1. Processing callbacks for shared axes with `emit=True`\n2. Potentially adding logic to prevent duplicate callback processing\n3.

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method, specifically at lines 1240-1248.\n\n2. **Current Behavior**: \n   - When `emit=True`, the callback is processed for the primary axis (line 1241)\n   - For shared axes, `_set_lim` is called with `emit=False` (line 1246), preventing callbacks from being emitted on shared axes\n\n3. **Problem**: Users expect `xlim_changed` callbacks to be triggered on all shared axes when limits change, but currently only the primary axis emits the callback.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The `emit=False` parameter in line 1246 prevents shared axes from processing their callbacks.\n\n5. **Note**: The problem description mentions the bug is in `_base.py` but from my analysis, the actual implementation that needs fixing is in `axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` delegates to `axis._set_lim`.\n\nBased on my analysis, I can now identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. The bug is in the `_set_lim` method where shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted.\n\n**Locations to fix:**\n\n1. **Primary location (lines 1240-1248)**: The main logic where shared axes are processed with `emit=False`\n2. **Specific line 1246**: Where `emit=False` is explicitly passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion. This can be achieved by either:\n- Changing the logic to emit callbacks for shared axes\n- Moving callback processing outside the emit condition\n- Adding a mechanism to prevent recursion while still emitting callbacks\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug report and code investigation, I can identify the root cause and locations that need to be fixed.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the `_set_lim` method in `axis.py` (not `_base.py` as mentioned in the bug report). When axis limits are changed on a primary axis, the callback is emitted correctly. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed, preventing the `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on shared axes.\n\nThe bug report mentions the issue is in `_base.py`, but the actual implementation that delegates to the axis-level logic is in `axis.py`. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` calls `self.xaxis._set_lim()`, which contains the problematic logic.\n\n**Key Locations:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1240,\n            \"end_line\": 1248\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis location contains the core logic where:\n1. Line 1241: The callback is processed for the primary axis when `emit=True`\n2. Lines 1242-1248: Shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted\n3. Line 1246: The specific line where `emit=False` is passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion, as suggested in the bug report by moving the callback processing outside the emit condition or implementing a proper recursion prevention mechanism.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture. The bug report confirms my analysis and provides additional context:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The issue is actually in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` in the `set_xlim` method, not in `axis.py` as I initially thought.\n\n2. **Problem**: When `set_xlim` is called on a primary axis, shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on those shared axes.\n\n3. **User's Observation**: The user noted that setting `emit=True` causes recursion issues, but moving the callback processing outside the `if emit:` statement solves the problem.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The callback processing is inside the `if emit:` block, and shared axes are called with `emit=False`, so they never process their callbacks.\n\nLet me examine the actual `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` to understand the current implementation and provide precise suggestions.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", \"start_line\": 3570, \"end_line\": 3650 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\nTotal lines: 4601\nShowing lines 3570-3619:\n\n3570:     def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, *, emit=True, auto=False,\n3571:                  xmin=None, xmax=None):\n3572:         \"\"\"\n3573:         Set the x-axis view limits.\n3574: \n3575:         Parameters\n3576:         ----------\n3577:         left : float, optional\n3578:             The left xlim in data coordinates.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Bug Analysis and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the matplotlib project related to the `xlim_changed` callback not being emitted on shared axes when axis limits are changed.\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib`\n- **Result**: Identified the matplotlib project structure with key directories including `lib/`, `src/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. Code Analysis - Axes Implementation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `set_xlim` method (lines 3570-3646) which delegates to `self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)`\n\n### 3. Code Analysis - Axis Implementation  \n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `_set_lim` method (lines 1179-1251) which contains the core logic for setting axis limits\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### Current Behavior (Lines 1240-1248 in axis.py):\n```python\nif emit:\n    self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n    # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n    for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n        if other is not self.axes:\n            other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)  # ← BUG: emit=False\n```\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. When `set_xlim` is called on the primary axis with `emit=True`, the callback is processed correctly\n2. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed\n3. This prevents the `xlim_changed` callback from being emitted on shared axes\n4. Users expecting callbacks on all shared axes don't receive them\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Method Flow:\n1. `Axes.set_xlim()` → calls `Axis._set_lim()` with `emit` parameter\n2. `Axis._set_lim()` processes the callback if `emit=True`\n3. For shared axes, it calls `_set_lim()` again but with `emit=False`\n\n### Current Implementation Logic:\n- The `emit=False` for shared axes appears to be intentional to avoid duplicate callback processing\n- However, this creates inconsistent behavior where callbacks aren't fired for shared axes\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n- ✅ Located the bug in the `_set_lim` method in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- ✅ Identified the specific line causing the issue (line 1246: `emit=False`)\n- ✅ Understood the method flow and callback processing mechanism\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. **Fix Implementation**: Modify the shared axes callback logic to emit callbacks appropriately\n2. **Test the Fix**: Create test cases to verify the fix works correctly\n3. **Consider Edge Cases**: Ensure the fix doesn't cause duplicate callbacks or other issues\n4. **Validate**: Test with actual matplotlib usage scenarios\n\n## Recommended Fix Strategy\n\nThe bug fix should modify lines 1242-1248 in `axis.py` to ensure callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding duplicates. The solution likely involves:\n1. Processing callbacks for shared axes with `emit=True`\n2. Potentially adding logic to prevent duplicate callback processing\n3.

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method, specifically at lines 1240-1248.\n\n2. **Current Behavior**: \n   - When `emit=True`, the callback is processed for the primary axis (line 1241)\n   - For shared axes, `_set_lim` is called with `emit=False` (line 1246), preventing callbacks from being emitted on shared axes\n\n3. **Problem**: Users expect `xlim_changed` callbacks to be triggered on all shared axes when limits change, but currently only the primary axis emits the callback.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The `emit=False` parameter in line 1246 prevents shared axes from processing their callbacks.\n\n5. **Note**: The problem description mentions the bug is in `_base.py` but from my analysis, the actual implementation that needs fixing is in `axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` delegates to `axis._set_lim`.\n\nBased on my analysis, I can now identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. The bug is in the `_set_lim` method where shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted.\n\n**Locations to fix:**\n\n1. **Primary location (lines 1240-1248)**: The main logic where shared axes are processed with `emit=False`\n2. **Specific line 1246**: Where `emit=False` is explicitly passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion. This can be achieved by either:\n- Changing the logic to emit callbacks for shared axes\n- Moving callback processing outside the emit condition\n- Adding a mechanism to prevent recursion while still emitting callbacks\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug report and code investigation, I can identify the root cause and locations that need to be fixed.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the `_set_lim` method in `axis.py` (not `_base.py` as mentioned in the bug report). When axis limits are changed on a primary axis, the callback is emitted correctly. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed, preventing the `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on shared axes.\n\nThe bug report mentions the issue is in `_base.py`, but the actual implementation that delegates to the axis-level logic is in `axis.py`. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` calls `self.xaxis._set_lim()`, which contains the problematic logic.\n\n**Key Locations:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1240,\n            \"end_line\": 1248\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis location contains the core logic where:\n1. Line 1241: The callback is processed for the primary axis when `emit=True`\n2. Lines 1242-1248: Shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted\n3. Line 1246: The specific line where `emit=False` is passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion, as suggested in the bug report by moving the callback processing outside the emit condition or implementing a proper recursion prevention mechanism.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture. The bug report confirms my analysis and provides additional context:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The issue is actually in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` in the `set_xlim` method, not in `axis.py` as I initially thought.\n\n2. **Problem**: When `set_xlim` is called on a primary axis, shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on those shared axes.\n\n3. **User's Observation**: The user noted that setting `emit=True` causes recursion issues, but moving the callback processing outside the `if emit:` statement solves the problem.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The callback processing is inside the `if emit:` block, and shared axes are called with `emit=False`, so they never process their callbacks.\n\nLet me examine the actual `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` to understand the current implementation and provide precise suggestions.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", \"start_line\": 3570, \"end_line\": 3650 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\nTotal lines: 4601\nShowing lines 3570-3619:\n\n3570:     def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, *, emit=True, auto=False,\n3571:                  xmin=None, xmax=None):\n3572:         \"\"\"\n3573:         Set the x-axis view limits.\n3574: \n3575:         Parameters\n3576:         ----------\n3577:         left : float, optional\n3578:             The left xlim in data coordinates.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n",

Code Analysis - Axis Implementation  \n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `_set_lim` method (lines 1179-1251) which contains the core logic for setting axis limits\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### Current Behavior (Lines 1240-1248 in axis.py):\n```python\nif emit:\n    self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n    # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n    for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n        if other is not self.axes:\n            other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)  # ← BUG: emit=False\n```\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. When `set_xlim` is called on the primary axis with `emit=True`, the callback is processed correctly\n2. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed\n3. This prevents the `xlim_changed` callback from being emitted on shared axes\n4. Users expecting callbacks on all shared axes don't receive them\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Method Flow:\n1. `Axes.set_xlim()` → calls `Axis._set_lim()` with `emit` parameter\n2. `Axis._set_lim()` processes the callback if `emit=True`\n3. For shared axes, it calls `_set_lim()` again but with `emit=False`\n\n### Current Implementation Logic:\n- The `emit=False` for shared axes appears to be intentional to avoid duplicate callback processing\n- However, this creates inconsistent behavior where callbacks aren't fired for shared axes\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n- ✅ Located the bug in the `_set_lim` method in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- ✅ Identified the specific line causing the issue (line 1246: `emit=False`)\n- ✅ Understood the method flow and callback processing mechanism\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. **Fix Implementation**: Modify the shared axes callback logic to emit callbacks appropriately\n2. **Test the Fix**: Create test cases to verify the fix works correctly\n3. **Consider Edge Cases**: Ensure the fix doesn't cause duplicate callbacks or other issues\n4. **Validate**: Test with actual matplotlib usage scenarios\n\n## Recommended Fix Strategy\n\nThe bug fix should modify lines 1242-1248 in `axis.py` to ensure callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding duplicates. The solution likely involves:\n1. Processing callbacks for shared axes with `emit=True`\n2. Potentially adding logic to prevent duplicate callback processing\n3. Ensuring backward compatibility\n\nThis analysis provides a clear path forward for implementing the bug fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nStart line: 1240\nEnd line: 1248\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me read the complete `_set_lim` method to understand the full implementation and see where the callback is processed.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\", \"start_line\": 1179, \"end_line\": 1250 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nTotal lines: 2702\nShowing lines 1179-1228:\n\n1179:     def _set_lim(self, v0, v1, *, emit=True, auto):\n1180:         \"\"\"\n1181:         Set view limits.\n1182: \n1183:         This method is a helper for the Axes ``set_xlim``, ``set_ylim``, and\n1184:         ``set_zlim`` methods.\n1185: \n1186:         Parameters\n1187:         ----------\n1188:         v0, v1 : float\n1189:             The view limits.

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method, specifically at lines 1240-1248.\n\n2. **Current Behavior**: \n   - When `emit=True`, the callback is processed for the primary axis (line 1241)\n   - For shared axes, `_set_lim` is called with `emit=False` (line 1246), preventing callbacks from being emitted on shared axes\n\n3. **Problem**: Users expect `xlim_changed` callbacks to be triggered on all shared axes when limits change, but currently only the primary axis emits the callback.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The `emit=False` parameter in line 1246 prevents shared axes from processing their callbacks.\n\n5. **Note**: The problem description mentions the bug is in `_base.py` but from my analysis, the actual implementation that needs fixing is in `axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` delegates to `axis._set_lim`.\n\nBased on my analysis, I can now identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. The bug is in the `_set_lim` method where shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted.\n\n**Locations to fix:**\n\n1. **Primary location (lines 1240-1248)**: The main logic where shared axes are processed with `emit=False`\n2. **Specific line 1246**: Where `emit=False` is explicitly passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion. This can be achieved by either:\n- Changing the logic to emit callbacks for shared axes\n- Moving callback processing outside the emit condition\n- Adding a mechanism to prevent recursion while still emitting callbacks\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug report and code investigation, I can identify the root cause and locations that need to be fixed.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the `_set_lim` method in `axis.py` (not `_base.py` as mentioned in the bug report). When axis limits are changed on a primary axis, the callback is emitted correctly. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed, preventing the `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on shared axes.\n\nThe bug report mentions the issue is in `_base.py`, but the actual implementation that delegates to the axis-level logic is in `axis.py`. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` calls `self.xaxis._set_lim()`, which contains the problematic logic.\n\n**Key Locations:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1240,\n            \"end_line\": 1248\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis location contains the core logic where:\n1. Line 1241: The callback is processed for the primary axis when `emit=True`\n2. Lines 1242-1248: Shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted\n3. Line 1246: The specific line where `emit=False` is passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion, as suggested in the bug report by moving the callback processing outside the emit condition or implementing a proper recursion prevention mechanism.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture. The bug report confirms my analysis and provides additional context:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The issue is actually in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` in the `set_xlim` method, not in `axis.py` as I initially thought.\n\n2. **Problem**: When `set_xlim` is called on a primary axis, shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on those shared axes.\n\n3. **User's Observation**: The user noted that setting `emit=True` causes recursion issues, but moving the callback processing outside the `if emit:` statement solves the problem.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The callback processing is inside the `if emit:` block, and shared axes are called with `emit=False`, so they never process their callbacks.\n\nLet me examine the actual `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` to understand the current implementation and provide precise suggestions.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", \"start_line\": 3570, \"end_line\": 3650 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\nTotal lines: 4601\nShowing lines 3570-3619:\n\n3570:     def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, *, emit=True, auto=False,\n3571:                  xmin=None, xmax=None):\n3572:         \"\"\"\n3573:         Set the x-axis view limits.\n3574: \n3575:         Parameters\n3576:         ----------\n3577:         left : float, optional\n3578:             The left xlim in data coordinates.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Bug Analysis and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the matplotlib project related to the `xlim_changed` callback not being emitted on shared axes when axis limits are changed.\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib`\n- **Result**: Identified the matplotlib project structure with key directories including `lib/`, `src/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. Code Analysis - Axes Implementation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `set_xlim` method (lines 3570-3646) which delegates to `self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)`\n\n### 3. Code Analysis - Axis Implementation  \n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `_set_lim` method (lines 1179-1251) which contains the core logic for setting axis limits\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### Current Behavior (Lines 1240-1248 in axis.py):\n```python\nif emit:\n    self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n    # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n    for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n        if other is not self.axes:\n            other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)  # ← BUG: emit=False\n```\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. When `set_xlim` is called on the primary axis with `emit=True`, the callback is processed correctly\n2. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed\n3. This prevents the `xlim_changed` callback from being emitted on shared axes\n4. Users expecting callbacks on all shared axes don't receive them\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Method Flow:\n1. `Axes.set_xlim()` → calls `Axis._set_lim()` with `emit` parameter\n2. `Axis._set_lim()` processes the callback if `emit=True`\n3. For shared axes, it calls `_set_lim()` again but with `emit=False`\n\n### Current Implementation Logic:\n- The `emit=False` for shared axes appears to be intentional to avoid duplicate callback processing\n- However, this creates inconsistent behavior where callbacks aren't fired for shared axes\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n- ✅ Located the bug in the `_set_lim` method in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- ✅ Identified the specific line causing the issue (line 1246: `emit=False`)\n- ✅ Understood the method flow and callback processing mechanism\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. **Fix Implementation**: Modify the shared axes callback logic to emit callbacks appropriately\n2. **Test the Fix**: Create test cases to verify the fix works correctly\n3. **Consider Edge Cases**: Ensure the fix doesn't cause duplicate callbacks or other issues\n4. **Validate**: Test with actual matplotlib usage scenarios\n\n## Recommended Fix Strategy\n\nThe bug fix should modify lines 1242-1248 in `axis.py` to ensure callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding duplicates. The solution likely involves:\n1. Processing callbacks for shared axes with `emit=True`\n2. Potentially adding logic to prevent duplicate callback processing\n3. Ensuring backward compatibility\n\nThis analysis provides a clear path forward for implementing the bug fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nStart line: 1240\nEnd line: 1248\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug and the code structure, I can now provide precise repair suggestions.

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method, specifically at lines 1240-1248.\n\n2. **Current Behavior**: \n   - When `emit=True`, the callback is processed for the primary axis (line 1241)\n   - For shared axes, `_set_lim` is called with `emit=False` (line 1246), preventing callbacks from being emitted on shared axes\n\n3. **Problem**: Users expect `xlim_changed` callbacks to be triggered on all shared axes when limits change, but currently only the primary axis emits the callback.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The `emit=False` parameter in line 1246 prevents shared axes from processing their callbacks.\n\n5. **Note**: The problem description mentions the bug is in `_base.py` but from my analysis, the actual implementation that needs fixing is in `axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` delegates to `axis._set_lim`.\n\nBased on my analysis, I can now identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. The bug is in the `_set_lim` method where shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted.\n\n**Locations to fix:**\n\n1. **Primary location (lines 1240-1248)**: The main logic where shared axes are processed with `emit=False`\n2. **Specific line 1246**: Where `emit=False` is explicitly passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion. This can be achieved by either:\n- Changing the logic to emit callbacks for shared axes\n- Moving callback processing outside the emit condition\n- Adding a mechanism to prevent recursion while still emitting callbacks\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug report and code investigation, I can identify the root cause and locations that need to be fixed.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the `_set_lim` method in `axis.py` (not `_base.py` as mentioned in the bug report). When axis limits are changed on a primary axis, the callback is emitted correctly. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed, preventing the `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on shared axes.\n\nThe bug report mentions the issue is in `_base.py`, but the actual implementation that delegates to the axis-level logic is in `axis.py`. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` calls `self.xaxis._set_lim()`, which contains the problematic logic.\n\n**Key Locations:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1240,\n            \"end_line\": 1248\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis location contains the core logic where:\n1. Line 1241: The callback is processed for the primary axis when `emit=True`\n2. Lines 1242-1248: Shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted\n3. Line 1246: The specific line where `emit=False` is passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion, as suggested in the bug report by moving the callback processing outside the emit condition or implementing a proper recursion prevention mechanism.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture. The bug report confirms my analysis and provides additional context:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The issue is actually in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` in the `set_xlim` method, not in `axis.py` as I initially thought.\n\n2. **Problem**: When `set_xlim` is called on a primary axis, shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on those shared axes.\n\n3. **User's Observation**: The user noted that setting `emit=True` causes recursion issues, but moving the callback processing outside the `if emit:` statement solves the problem.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The callback processing is inside the `if emit:` block, and shared axes are called with `emit=False`, so they never process their callbacks.\n\nLet me examine the actual `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` to understand the current implementation and provide precise suggestions.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", \"start_line\": 3570, \"end_line\": 3650 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\nTotal lines: 4601\nShowing lines 3570-3619:\n\n3570:     def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, *, emit=True, auto=False,\n3571:                  xmin=None, xmax=None):\n3572:         \"\"\"\n3573:         Set the x-axis view limits.\n3574: \n3575:         Parameters\n3576:         ----------\n3577:         left : float, optional\n3578:             The left xlim in data coordinates.

The user's observation about moving the callback processing outside the `if emit:` statement is the key insight.\n\nLet me examine if there are any shared axis methods to understand the complete picture:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_get_shared_axes\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_get_shared_axes' in file (showing first 5 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nLines 721-727:\n 721:     def isDefault_minfmt(self, value):\n 722:         self.minor._formatter_is_default = value\n 723: \n 724:     def _get_shared_axes(self):\n 725:         \"\"\"Return Grouper of shared axes for current axis.\"\"\"\n 726:         return self.axes._shared_axes[\n 727:             self._get_axis_name()].get_siblings(self.axes)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nLines 729-735:\n 729:     def _get_shared_axis(self):\n 730:         \"\"\"Return list of shared axis for current axis.\"\"\"\n 731:         name = self._get_axis_name()\n 732:         return [ax._axis_map[name] for ax in self._get_shared_axes()]\n 733: \n 734:     def _get_axis_name(self):\n 735:         \"\"\"Return the axis name.\"\"\"\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nLines 823-829:\n 823:         name = self._get_axis_name()\n 824:         old_default_lims = (self.get_major_locator()\n 825:                             .nonsingular(-np.inf, np.inf))\n 826:         for ax in self._get_shared_axes():\n 827:             ax._axis_map[name]._set_scale(value, **kwargs)\n 828:             ax._update_transScale()\n 829:             ax.stale = True\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nLines 1232-1238:\n1232: \n1233:         self.set_view_interval(v0, v1, ignore=True)\n1234:         # Mark viewlims as no longer stale without triggering an autoscale.\n1235:         for ax in self._get_shared_axes():\n1236:             ax._stale_viewlims[name] = False\n1237:         if auto is not None:\n1238:             self._set_autoscale_on(bool(auto))\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nLines 1240-1246:\n1240:         if emit:\n1241:             self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n1242:             # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n1243:             for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n1244:                 if other is not self.axes:\n1245:                     other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n1246:                         v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug and the code structure, I can now provide precise repair suggestions. The issue is in the `_set_lim` method in `axis.py` where shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted on those axes.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe current implementation processes callbacks only when `emit=True`, but shared axes are called with `emit=False` to prevent recursion. However, this also prevents legitimate callbacks from being triggered on shared axes, which is the bug users are experiencing.\n\n**Repair Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Location: `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`, lines 1240-1248**\n   - **Current Problem**: Callbacks are processed inside the `if emit:` block, and shared axes are called with `emit=False`, preventing their callbacks from firing.\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Move the callback processing for shared axes outside the `if emit:` block to ensure callbacks are always triggered on shared axes, while maintaining the recursion prevention by keeping `emit=False` for the recursive calls.\n   - **Implementation**: \n     ```python\n     if emit:\n         self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n         # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n         for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n             if other is not self.axes:\n                 other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                     v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)\n                 if other.figure != self.figure:\n                     other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\n     \n     # Process callbacks for shared axes outside emit condition\n     # to ensure they always fire while avoiding recursion\n     if emit:\n         for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n             if other is not self.axes:\n                 other.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", other)\n     ```\n\n2. **Alternative approach (lines 1240-1248)**:\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Restructure the logic to separate the limit setting from callback processing, ensuring callbacks fire for all shared axes without recursion.\n   - **Implementation**:\n     ```python\n     if emit:\n         self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n     \n     # Update shared axes limits (without emit to prevent recursion)\n     for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n         if other is not self.axes:\n             other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                 v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)\n             if other.figure != self.figure:\n                 other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\n             # Process callback for shared axis after limit is set\n             if emit:\n                 other.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", other)\n     ```\n\n**Key Design Considerations:**\n- Maintain recursion prevention by keeping `emit=False` in the recursive `_set_lim` calls\n- Ensure callbacks are triggered on all shared axes when the primary axis changes\n- Preserve the existing behavior for non-shared axes\n- Maintain framework design patterns and API compliance\n\nThe preferred solution is the second approach as it clearly separates limit setting from callback processing and ensures callbacks fire for all affected axes while preventing infinite recursion.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py lines 1240-1248\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        if emit:\n            self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n            # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n            for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n                if other is not self.axes:\n                    other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                        v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)\n                    if other.figure != self.figure:\n                        other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nxlim_changed not emitted on shared axis\n<!--To help us understand and resolve your issue, please fill out the form to the best of your ability.-->\r\n<!--You can feel free to delete the sections that do not apply.-->\r\n\r\n### Bug report\r\n\r\n**Bug summary**\r\n\r\nWhen an axis is shared with another its registered \"xlim_changed\" callbacks does not get called when the change is induced by a shared axis (via sharex=). \r\n\r\nIn _base.py the set_xlim for sibling axis are called with emit=False:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmatplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py:\r\n\r\n/.../\r\ndef set_xlim(...)\r\n/.../\r\n        if emit:\r\n            self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)\r\n            # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one\r\n            for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):\r\n                if other is not self:\r\n                    other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,\r\n                                   emit=False, auto=auto)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm very new to matplotlib, so perhaps there is a good reason for this? emit=False seems to disable both continued \"inheritance\" of axis (why?) and triggering of change callbacks (looking at the code above).\r\n\r\nIt seems like one would at least want to trigger the xlim_changed callbacks as they would be intended to react to any change in axis limits.\r\n\r\nEdit: Setting emit=True seems to introduce a recursion issue (not sure why but as inheritance seems to be passed along anyway it doesn't really matter). Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n",

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Bug Analysis and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the matplotlib project related to the `xlim_changed` callback not being emitted on shared axes when axis limits are changed.\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib`\n- **Result**: Identified the matplotlib project structure with key directories including `lib/`, `src/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. Code Analysis - Axes Implementation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `set_xlim` method (lines 3570-3646) which delegates to `self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)`\n\n### 3. Code Analysis - Axis Implementation  \n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `_set_lim` method (lines 1179-1251) which contains the core logic for setting axis limits\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### Current Behavior (Lines 1240-1248 in axis.py):\n```python\nif emit:\n    self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n    # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n    for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n        if other is not self.axes:\n            other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)  # ← BUG: emit=False\n```\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. When `set_xlim` is called on the primary axis with `emit=True`, the callback is processed correctly\n2. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed\n3. This prevents the `xlim_changed` callback from being emitted on shared axes\n4. Users expecting callbacks on all shared axes don't receive them\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Method Flow:\n1. `Axes.set_xlim()` → calls `Axis._set_lim()` with `emit` parameter\n2. `Axis._set_lim()` processes the callback if `emit=True`\n3. For shared axes, it calls `_set_lim()` again but with `emit=False`\n\n### Current Implementation Logic:\n- The `emit=False` for shared axes appears to be intentional to avoid duplicate callback processing\n- However, this creates inconsistent behavior where callbacks aren't fired for shared axes\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n- ✅ Located the bug in the `_set_lim` method in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- ✅ Identified the specific line causing the issue (line 1246: `emit=False`)\n- ✅ Understood the method flow and callback processing mechanism\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. **Fix Implementation**: Modify the shared axes callback logic to emit callbacks appropriately\n2. **Test the Fix**: Create test cases to verify the fix works correctly\n3. **Consider Edge Cases**: Ensure the fix doesn't cause duplicate callbacks or other issues\n4. **Validate**: Test with actual matplotlib usage scenarios\n\n## Recommended Fix Strategy\n\nThe bug fix should modify lines 1242-1248 in `axis.py` to ensure callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding duplicates. The solution likely involves:\n1. Processing callbacks for shared axes with `emit=True`\n2. Potentially adding logic to prevent duplicate callback processing\n3.

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method, specifically at lines 1240-1248.\n\n2. **Current Behavior**: \n   - When `emit=True`, the callback is processed for the primary axis (line 1241)\n   - For shared axes, `_set_lim` is called with `emit=False` (line 1246), preventing callbacks from being emitted on shared axes\n\n3. **Problem**: Users expect `xlim_changed` callbacks to be triggered on all shared axes when limits change, but currently only the primary axis emits the callback.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The `emit=False` parameter in line 1246 prevents shared axes from processing their callbacks.\n\n5. **Note**: The problem description mentions the bug is in `_base.py` but from my analysis, the actual implementation that needs fixing is in `axis.py` in the `_set_lim` method. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` delegates to `axis._set_lim`.\n\nBased on my analysis, I can now identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. The bug is in the `_set_lim` method where shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted.\n\n**Locations to fix:**\n\n1. **Primary location (lines 1240-1248)**: The main logic where shared axes are processed with `emit=False`\n2. **Specific line 1246**: Where `emit=False` is explicitly passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion. This can be achieved by either:\n- Changing the logic to emit callbacks for shared axes\n- Moving callback processing outside the emit condition\n- Adding a mechanism to prevent recursion while still emitting callbacks\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug report and code investigation, I can identify the root cause and locations that need to be fixed.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the `_set_lim` method in `axis.py` (not `_base.py` as mentioned in the bug report). When axis limits are changed on a primary axis, the callback is emitted correctly. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed, preventing the `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on shared axes.\n\nThe bug report mentions the issue is in `_base.py`, but the actual implementation that delegates to the axis-level logic is in `axis.py`. The `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` calls `self.xaxis._set_lim()`, which contains the problematic logic.\n\n**Key Locations:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1240,\n            \"end_line\": 1248\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis location contains the core logic where:\n1. Line 1241: The callback is processed for the primary axis when `emit=True`\n2. Lines 1242-1248: Shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted\n3. Line 1246: The specific line where `emit=False` is passed to shared axes\n\nThe fix should ensure that callbacks are emitted for shared axes while avoiding infinite recursion, as suggested in the bug report by moving the callback processing outside the emit condition or implementing a proper recursion prevention mechanism.\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture. The bug report confirms my analysis and provides additional context:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: The issue is actually in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` in the `set_xlim` method, not in `axis.py` as I initially thought.\n\n2. **Problem**: When `set_xlim` is called on a primary axis, shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing `xlim_changed` callbacks from being triggered on those shared axes.\n\n3. **User's Observation**: The user noted that setting `emit=True` causes recursion issues, but moving the callback processing outside the `if emit:` statement solves the problem.\n\n4. **Root Cause**: The callback processing is inside the `if emit:` block, and shared axes are called with `emit=False`, so they never process their callbacks.\n\nLet me examine the actual `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` to understand the current implementation and provide precise suggestions.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", \"start_line\": 3570, \"end_line\": 3650 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\nTotal lines: 4601\nShowing lines 3570-3619:\n\n3570:     def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, *, emit=True, auto=False,\n3571:                  xmin=None, xmax=None):\n3572:         \"\"\"\n3573:         Set the x-axis view limits.\n3574: \n3575:         Parameters\n3576:         ----------\n3577:         left : float, optional\n3578:             The left xlim in data coordinates.

Let me analyze the context from both files:\n\n1. **In `_base.py`**: The `set_xlim` method (line 3646) delegates to `self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)`\n\n2. **In `axis.py`**: The `_set_lim` method contains the problematic logic where shared axes are called with `emit=False`\n\nThe bug report mentions the issue is in `_base.py`, but looking at the current code, it seems the logic has been moved to `axis.py`. The user's observation about moving the callback processing outside the `if emit:` statement is the key insight.\n\nLet me examine if there are any shared axis methods to understand the complete picture:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_get_shared_axes\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_get_shared_axes' in file (showing first 5 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nLines 721-727:\n 721:     def isDefault_minfmt(self, value):\n 722:         self.minor._formatter_is_default = value\n 723: \n 724:     def _get_shared_axes(self):\n 725:         \"\"\"Return Grouper of shared axes for current axis.\"\"\"\n 726:         return self.axes._shared_axes[\n 727:             self._get_axis_name()].get_siblings(self.axes)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nLines 729-735:\n 729:     def _get_shared_axis(self):\n 730:         \"\"\"Return list of shared axis for current axis.\"\"\"\n 731:         name = self._get_axis_name()\n 732:         return [ax._axis_map[name] for ax in self._get_shared_axes()]\n 733: \n 734:     def _get_axis_name(self):\n 735:         \"\"\"Return the axis name.\"\"\"\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nLines 823-829:\n 823:         name = self._get_axis_name()\n 824:         old_default_lims = (self.get_major_locator()\n 825:                             .nonsingular(-np.inf, np.inf))\n 826:         for ax in self._get_shared_axes():\n 827:             ax._axis_map[name]._set_scale(value, **kwargs)\n 828:             ax._update_transScale()\n 829:             ax.stale = True\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nLines 1232-1238:\n1232: \n1233:         self.set_view_interval(v0, v1, ignore=True)\n1234:         # Mark viewlims as no longer stale without triggering an autoscale.\n1235:         for ax in self._get_shared_axes():\n1236:             ax._stale_viewlims[name] = False\n1237:         if auto is not None:\n1238:             self._set_autoscale_on(bool(auto))\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nLines 1240-1246:\n1240:         if emit:\n1241:             self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n1242:             # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n1243:             for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n1244:                 if other is not self.axes:\n1245:                     other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n1246:                         v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug and the code structure, I can now provide precise repair suggestions. The issue is in the `_set_lim` method in `axis.py` where shared axes are updated with `emit=False`, preventing callbacks from being emitted on those axes.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe current implementation processes callbacks only when `emit=True`, but shared axes are called with `emit=False` to prevent recursion. However, this also prevents legitimate callbacks from being triggered on shared axes, which is the bug users are experiencing.\n\n**Repair Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Location: `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`, lines 1240-1248**\n   - **Current Problem**: Callbacks are processed inside the `if emit:` block, and shared axes are called with `emit=False`, preventing their callbacks from firing.\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Move the callback processing for shared axes outside the `if emit:` block to ensure callbacks are always triggered on shared axes, while maintaining the recursion prevention by keeping `emit=False` for the recursive calls.\n   - **Implementation**: \n     ```python\n     if emit:\n         self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n         # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n         for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n             if other is not self.axes:\n                 other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                     v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)\n                 if other.figure != self.figure:\n                     other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\n     \n     # Process callbacks for shared axes outside emit condition\n     # to ensure they always fire while avoiding recursion\n     if emit:\n         for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n             if other is not self.axes:\n                 other.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", other)\n     ```\n\n2. **Alternative approach (lines 1240-1248)**:\n   - **Suggested Fix**: Restructure the logic to separate the limit setting from callback processing, ensuring callbacks fire for all shared axes without recursion.\n   - **Implementation**:\n     ```python\n     if emit:\n         self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n     \n     # Update shared axes limits (without emit to prevent recursion)\n     for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n         if other is not self.axes:\n             other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                 v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)\n             if other.figure != self.figure:\n                 other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\n             # Process callback for shared axis after limit is set\n             if emit:\n                 other.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", other)\n     ```\n\n**Key Design Considerations:**\n- Maintain recursion prevention by keeping `emit=False` in the recursive `_set_lim` calls\n- Ensure callbacks are triggered on all shared axes when the primary axis changes\n- Preserve the existing behavior for non-shared axes\n- Maintain framework design patterns and API compliance\n\nThe preferred solution is the second approach as it clearly separates limit setting from callback processing and ensures callbacks fire for all affected axes while preventing infinite recursion.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py lines 1240-1248\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        if emit:\n            self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n            # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n            for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n                if other is not self.axes:\n                    other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                        v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)\n                    if other.figure != self.figure:\n                        other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\nAssistant: Looking at the code segment provided, I can see that this is indeed the location where the bug occurs. The current implementation has the callback processing inside the `if emit:` block, and shared axes are called with `emit=False`, which prevents callbacks from being triggered on shared axes.\n\nHowever, I notice there's a discrepancy between the code shown and what I found in my analysis:\n\n1. **Code Location**: The code segment shows the logic is in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py` lines 1240-1248, which matches my analysis.\n\n2. **Bug Report Reference**: The bug report mentions the issue is in `_base.py` with a `set_xlim` method that calls `other.set_xlim()`, but the actual current implementation delegates to `axis._set_lim()`.\n\n3. **Current Implementation**: The code segment shows the correct current implementation where `other._axis_map[name]._set_lim()` is called with `emit=False`.\n\nThe location is ready for fixing because:\n\n- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Callbacks are processed only when `emit=True`, but shared axes are updated with `emit=False`\n- ✅ **Clear Fix Strategy**: Move callback processing outside the `if emit:` block or add separate callback processing for shared axes\n- ✅ **Recursion Prevention**: The fix can maintain `emit=False` for the recursive calls while still processing callbacks\n- ✅ **Framework Compliance**: The fix preserves existing behavior while adding the missing callback functionality\n\nThe user's observation in the bug report is correct: \"Moving the callback call to outside of the 'if emit:'-statement seems to solve the issue.\" This aligns perfectly with the suggested fix approach.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\nUser: [Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py lines 1240-1248\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import datetime\n  import functools\n  import logging\n  from numbers import Real\n  import numpy as np\n  import matplotlib as mpl\n  from matplotlib import _api, cbook\n  import matplotlib.artist as martist\n  import matplotlib.colors as mcolors\n  import matplotlib.lines as mlines\n  import matplotlib.scale as mscale\n  import matplotlib.text as mtext\n  import matplotlib.ticker as mticker\n  import matplotlib.transforms as mtransforms\n  import matplotlib.units as munits\n  import dateutil.tz\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C] 1230:         v0, v1 = self.limit_range_for_scale(v0, v1)\n[C] 1231:         v0, v1 = sorted([v0, v1], reverse=bool(reverse))\n[C] 1232: \n[C] 1233:         self.set_view_interval(v0, v1, ignore=True)\n[C] 1234:         # Mark viewlims as no longer stale without triggering an autoscale.\n[C] 1235:         for ax in self._get_shared_axes():\n[C] 1236:             ax._stale_viewlims[name] = False\n[C] 1237:         if auto is not None:\n[C] 1238:             self._set_autoscale_on(bool(auto))\n[C] 1239: \n[R] 1240:         if emit:\n[R] 1241:             self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n[R] 1242:             # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n[R] 1243:             for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n[R] 1244:                 if other is not self.axes:\n[R] 1245:                     other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n[R] 1246:                         v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)\n[R] 1247:                     if other.figure != self.figure:\n[R] 1248:                         other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\n[C] 1249: \n[C] 1250:         self.stale = True\n[C] 1251:         return v0, v1\n[C] 1252: \n[C] 1253:     def _set_artist_props(self, a):\n[C] 1254:         if a is None:\n[C] 1255:             return\n[C] 1256:         a.set_figure(self.figure)\n[C] 1257: \n[C] 1258:     def _update_ticks(self):\n\nYou must pay close attention to **indentation** — especially the relative indentation level between the patch and its parent scope (for example, the containing class or function).\n⚠️ **Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n⚠️ **Do not combine fixes for different locations into one block** — every location's fix should be in a **separate** ```python```code block.\n\nHere are the suggestions from the Suggester:\nS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug and the code structure, I can now provide precise repair suggestions.

    "response": "# Bug Analysis and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the matplotlib project related to the `xlim_changed` callback not being emitted on shared axes when axis limits are changed.\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib`\n- **Result**: Identified the matplotlib project structure with key directories including `lib/`, `src/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. Code Analysis - Axes Implementation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `set_xlim` method (lines 3570-3646) which delegates to `self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)`\n\n### 3. Code Analysis - Axis Implementation  \n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `_set_lim` method (lines 1179-1251) which contains the core logic for setting axis limits\n\n### 4. Complete Method Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on axis.py lines 1179-1280\n- **Result**: Found the complete `_set_lim` method implementation showing the exact bug location\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### Current Behavior (Lines 1240-1248 in axis.py):\n```python\nif emit:\n    self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n    # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n    for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n        if other is not self.axes:\n            other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)  # ← BUG: emit=False\n            if other.figure != self.figure:\n                other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\n```\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. When `set_xlim` is called on the primary axis with `emit=True`, the callback is processed correctly\n2. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed\n3. This prevents the `xlim_changed` callback from being emitted on shared axes\n4. Users expecting callbacks on all shared axes don't receive them\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Method Flow:\n1. `Axes.set_xlim()` → calls `Axis._set_lim()` with `emit` parameter\n2. `Axis._set_lim()` processes the callback if `emit=True`\n3.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Bug Analysis and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the matplotlib project related to the `xlim_changed` callback not being emitted on shared axes when axis limits are changed.\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib`\n- **Result**: Identified the matplotlib project structure with key directories including `lib/`, `src/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. Code Analysis - Axes Implementation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `set_xlim` method (lines 3570-3646) which delegates to `self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)`\n\n### 3. Code Analysis - Axis Implementation  \n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the `_set_lim` method (lines 1179-1251) which contains the core logic for setting axis limits\n\n### 4. Complete Method Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on axis.py lines 1179-1280\n- **Result**: Found the complete `_set_lim` method implementation showing the exact bug location\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### Current Behavior (Lines 1240-1248 in axis.py):\n```python\nif emit:\n    self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n    # Call all of the other axes that are shared with this one\n    for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n        if other is not self.axes:\n            other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(\n                v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)  # ← BUG: emit=False\n            if other.figure != self.figure:\n                other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\n```\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. When `set_xlim` is called on the primary axis with `emit=True`, the callback is processed correctly\n2. However, when updating shared axes, `emit=False` is explicitly passed\n3. This prevents the `xlim_changed` callback from being emitted on shared axes\n4. Users expecting callbacks on all shared axes don't receive them\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Method Flow:\n1. `Axes.set_xlim()` → calls `Axis._set_lim()` with `emit` parameter\n2. `Axis._set_lim()` processes the callback if `emit=True`\n3. For shared axes, it calls `_set_lim()` again but with `emit=False`\n\n### Current Implementation Logic:\n- The `emit=False` for shared axes appears to be intentional to avoid infinite recursion\n- However, this creates inconsistent behavior where callbacks aren't fired for shared axes\n\n## Repair Strategy Development\n\n### 5. Shared Axes Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for `_get_shared_axes` in axis.py\n- **Result**: Found the shared axes mechanism and confirmed the callback processing logic\n\n### 6. Location Confirmation and Fix Proposal\n- **Status**: PROPOSE LOCATION confirmed\n- **Primary Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`, lines 1240-1248\n- **Root Cause**: Callbacks are processed inside the `if emit:` block, but shared axes are called with `emit=False`\n\n## Proposed Fix Strategy\n\n### Two Alternative Approaches Identified:\n\n**Approach 1**: Move callback processing for shared axes outside the `if emit:` block\n```python\nif emit:\n    self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n    # Update shared axes with emit=False to prevent recursion\n    for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n        if other is not self.axes:\n            other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)\n            if other.figure != self.figure:\n                other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\n\n# Process callbacks for shared axes outside emit condition\nif emit:\n    for other in self._get_shared_axes():\n        if other is not self.axes:\n            other.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", other)\n```\n\n**Approach 2** (Preferred): Restructure to separate limit setting from callback processing\n```python\nif emit:\n    self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)\n\n# Update shared axes limits (without emit to prevent recursion)\nfor other in self._get_shared_axes():\n    if other is not self.axes:\n        other._axis_map[name]._set_lim(v0, v1, emit=False, auto=auto)\n        if other.figure != self.figure:\n            other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()\n        # Process callback for shared axis after limit is set\n        if emit:\n            other.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", other)\n```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n- ✅ Located the exact bug in the `_set_lim` method in `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`\n- ✅ Identified the specific lines causing the issue (lines 1240-1248)\n- ✅ Understood the complete method flow and callback processing mechanism\n- ✅ Analyzed shared axes implementation and recursion prevention logic\n- ✅ Developed two comprehensive fix strategies\n- ✅ Confirmed location is ready for fixing with **CONTINUE TO FIX** status\n\n### Ready for Implementation:\n- **Target Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py`, lines 1240-1248\n- **Fix Strategy**: Approach 2 (separate limit setting from callback processing)\n- **Key Design Principles**: \n  - Maintain recursion prevention by keeping `emit=False` in recursive calls\n  - Ensure callbacks are triggered on all shared axes when primary axis changes\n  - Preserve existing behavior for non-shared axes\n  - Maintain framework design patterns and API compliance\n\n### Next Step:\nReady to implement the patch using the preferred Approach 2 strategy to fix the callback emission bug for shared axes.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axis.py\nStart line: 1240\nEnd line: 1248\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug and the code structure, I can now provide precise repair suggestions.
