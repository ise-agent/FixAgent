Root Cause Identification\n- **Problem Location**: `_compare_eq_sequence()` function in `/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`\n- **Issue**: When comparing byte strings of different lengths, the function uses `saferepr(left[len_right])` or `saferepr(right[len_left])` to show extra items\n- **Bug Mechanism**: For byte strings, indexing returns integer values (ASCII ordinals) rather than character representations\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Current Problematic Code Flow:\n1. Assertion comparison triggers in line 131-132 where `issequence(left) and issequence(right)` is true for byte strings\n2. `_compare_eq_sequence()` is called to handle the comparison\n3. When lengths differ, lines 271/275 extract extra items using indexing: `left[len_right]` or `right[len_left]`\n4. For byte strings, this indexing returns integer ASCII values instead of byte characters\n5. `saferepr()` then displays these integers, showing \"52\" instead of \"b'4'\"\n\n### Key Code Locations:\n- **Main comparison logic**: `/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, lines 129-135\n- **Sequence comparison function**: `/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, lines 256-286\n- **Problematic lines**: 271, 275, 283-284\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Root cause analysis and bug location identification\n- ✅ **Completed**: Understanding of the code flow and problem mechanism\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Ready to implement fix\n- ⏳ **Pending**: Fix implementation, testing, and validation\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify `_compare_eq_sequence()` to detect byte strings and handle them appropriately\n2. **Possible Solutions**:\n   - Add special handling for `bytes` type before the generic sequence comparison\n   - Modify the extra item extraction to preserve byte character representation\n   - Consider using slice notation `[start:start+1]` instead of indexing for bytes\n3. **Testing**: Create test cases to verify the fix works correctly\n4. **Validation**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality for other sequence types\n\n## Important Technical Considerations\n- The fix should maintain backward compatibility with existing sequence comparison behavior\n- Need to distinguish between `bytes` objects and other sequence types\n- The solution should preserve the helpful diff information while fixing the display issue\n- Consider edge cases like empty byte strings and mixed-type comparisons\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nPerfect! I found the issue. The problem is in the assertion utility code where it's treating byte strings as sequences and showing the ASCII ordinal values instead of the actual byte characters. Let me examine the specific function that handles sequence comparisons.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\", \"start_line\": 250, \"end_line\": 300 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nTotal lines: 391\nShowing lines 250-299:\n\n 250:     explanation.extend(\n 251:         line.strip() for line in difflib.ndiff(left_formatting, right_formatting)\n 252:     )\n 253:     return explanation\n 254: \n 255: \n 256: def _compare_eq_sequence(left, right, verbose=0):\n 257:     explanation = []\n 258:     len_left = len(left)\n 259:     len_right = len(right)\n 260:     for i in range(min(len_left, len_right)):\n 261:         if left[i] != right[i]:\n 262:             explanation += [\n 263:                 \"At index {} diff: {!r} != {!r}\".format(i, left[i], right[i])\n 264:             ]\n 265:             break\n 266:     len_diff = len_left - len_right\n 267: \n 268:     if len_diff:\n 269:         if len_diff > 0:\n 270:             dir_with_more = \"Left\"\n 271:             extra = saferepr(left[len_right])\n 272:         else:\n 273:             len_diff = 0 - len_diff\n 274:             dir_with_more = \"Right\"\n 275:             extra = saferepr(right[len_left])\n 276: \n 277:         if len_diff == 1:\n 278:             explanation += [\n 279:                 \"{} contains one more item: {}\".format(dir_with_more, extra)\n 280:             ]\n 281:         else:\n 282:             explanation += [\n 283:                 \"%s contains %d more items, first extra item: %s\"\n 284:                 % (dir_with_more, len_diff, extra)\n 285:             ]\n 286:     return explanation\n 287: \n 288: \n 289: def _compare_eq_set(left, right, verbose=0):\n 290:     explanation = []\n 291:     diff_left = left - right\n 292:     diff_right = right - left\n 293:     if diff_left:\n 294:         explanation.append(\"Extra items in the left set:\")\n 295:         for item in diff_left:\n 296:             explanation.append(saferepr(item))\n 297:     if diff_right:\n 298:         explanation.append(\"Extra items in the right set:\")\n 299:         for item in diff_right:\n\nNow I can see the issue clearly!

The problem is in the `_compare_eq_sequence` function. When comparing byte strings, pytest treats them as sequences and when showing the \"first extra item\", it's displaying the raw byte value (ASCII ordinal) instead of the character representation.\n\nLet me look at how the comparison logic determines which comparison function to use:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_compare_eq_sequence\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_compare_eq_sequence' in directory (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nLines 129-135:\n 129:                 explanation = _diff_text(left, right, verbose)\n 130:             else:\n 131:                 if issequence(left) and issequence(right):\n 132:                     explanation = _compare_eq_sequence(left, right, verbose)\n 133:                 elif isset(left) and isset(right):\n 134:                     explanation = _compare_eq_set(left, right, verbose)\n 135:                 elif isdict(left) and isdict(right):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nLines 253-259:\n 253:     return explanation\n 254: \n 255: \n 256: def _compare_eq_sequence(left, right, verbose=0):\n 257:     explanation = []\n 258:     len_left = len(left)\n 259:     len_right = len(right)\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the bug. The issue is that when comparing byte strings of different lengths, pytest treats them as sequences and shows the ASCII ordinal value of the extra byte instead of the byte character representation.\n\nLet me check what the `issequence` function considers as sequences to understand why byte strings are being handled this way:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"def issequence\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'def issequence' in directory (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nLines 81-87:\n  81:     return result\n  82: \n  83: \n  84: def issequence(x):\n  85:     return isinstance(x, Sequence) and not isinstance(x, str)\n  86: \n  87: \n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: The `issequence()` function returns `True` for `bytes` objects because they inherit from `Sequence`, but when `_compare_eq_sequence()` indexes into a bytes object (e.g., `left[len_right]`), it returns an integer (ASCII ordinal) rather than a byte character.\n\n2. **Bug Location**: In `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`:\n   - Line 85: `issequence()` treats bytes as sequences\n   - Lines 131-132: The comparison logic routes bytes to `_compare_eq_sequence()`\n   - Lines 271 and 275: The problematic indexing that extracts raw byte values\n   - Lines 283-284: Where the confusing message is displayed\n\n3. **The Fix**: We need to add special handling for bytes objects before they get processed as generic sequences.

The routing logic (#2) and message formatting (#4) will automatically benefit from the other fixes without requiring changes.",

When lengths differ, lines 271/275 extract extra items using indexing: `left[len_right]` or `right[len_left]`\n4. For byte strings, this indexing returns integer ASCII values instead of byte characters\n5. `saferepr()` then displays these integers, showing \"52\" instead of \"b'4'\"\n\n### Key Code Locations:\n- **Main comparison logic**: `/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, lines 129-135\n- **Sequence comparison function**: `/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, lines 256-286\n- **Problematic lines**: 271, 275, 283-284\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Root cause analysis and bug location identification\n- ✅ **Completed**: Understanding of the code flow and problem mechanism\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Ready to implement fix\n- ⏳ **Pending**: Fix implementation, testing, and validation\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify `_compare_eq_sequence()` to detect byte strings and handle them appropriately\n2. **Possible Solutions**:\n   - Add special handling for `bytes` type before the generic sequence comparison\n   - Modify the extra item extraction to preserve byte character representation\n   - Consider using slice notation `[start:start+1]` instead of indexing for bytes\n3. **Testing**: Create test cases to verify the fix works correctly\n4. **Validation**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality for other sequence types\n\n## Important Technical Considerations\n- The fix should maintain backward compatibility with existing sequence comparison behavior\n- Need to distinguish between `bytes` objects and other sequence types\n- The solution should preserve the helpful diff information while fixing the display issue\n- Consider edge cases like empty byte strings and mixed-type comparisons\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nStart line: 84\nEnd line: 86\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nStart line: 129\nEnd line: 135\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nStart line: 268\nEnd line: 276\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nStart line: 277\nEnd line: 285\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nStart line: 260\nEnd line: 265\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug locations, here are my coordinated repair suggestions to fix the confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings:\n\n1. **[Lines 84-86] `issequence()` function**: Modify to exclude bytes objects from being treated as generic sequences:\n   ```python\n   def issequence(x):\n       return isinstance(x, Sequence) and not isinstance(x, (str, bytes))\n   ```\n   This prevents bytes from being routed to the problematic sequence comparison logic and allows them to be handled by the more appropriate text diff comparison.\n\n2. **[Lines 129-135] Main comparison routing logic**: This location will automatically benefit from fix #1, as bytes objects will no longer satisfy `issequence(left) and issequence(right)` and will fall through to the text comparison logic that already handles bytes properly with `_diff_text()`.\n\n3. **[Lines 268-276] Extra item extraction in `_compare_eq_sequence()`**: Add bytes detection as a safety net:\n   ```python\n   if len_diff:\n       if len_diff > 0:\n           dir_with_more = \"Left\"\n           if isinstance(left, bytes):\n               extra = saferepr(left[len_right:len_right+1])  # Get byte slice instead of ordinal\n           else:\n               extra = saferepr(left[len_right])\n       else:\n           len_diff = 0 - len_diff\n           dir_with_more = \"Right\"\n           if isinstance(right, bytes):\n               extra = saferepr(right[len_left:len_left+1])  # Get byte slice instead of ordinal\n           else:\n               extra = saferepr(right[len_left])\n   ```\n\n4. **[Lines 277-285] Error message formatting**: This location will automatically display the correct representation once fix #3 provides proper byte character representation instead of ASCII ordinals.\n\n5. **[Lines 260-265] Individual item comparison**: Add similar bytes handling for consistency:\n   ```python\n   for i in range(min(len_left, len_right)):\n       if left[i] != right[i]:\n           if isinstance(left, bytes):\n               left_item = left[i:i+1]\n               right_item = right[i:i+1]\n           else:\n               left_item = left[i]\n               right_item = right[i]\n           explanation += [\n               \"At index {} diff: {!r} != {!r}\".format(i, left_item, right_item)\n           ]\n           break\n   ```\n\n**Coordination Strategy**: Fix #1 is the primary solution that prevents bytes from entering the problematic sequence comparison path entirely. Fixes #3 and #5 serve as defensive programming to handle any edge cases where bytes might still reach the sequence comparison logic. The routing logic (#2) and message formatting (#4) will automatically benefit from the other fixes without requiring changes.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nPerfect! I found the issue. The problem is in the assertion utility code where it's treating byte strings as sequences and showing the ASCII ordinal values instead of the actual byte characters. Let me examine the specific function that handles sequence comparisons.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\", \"start_line\": 250, \"end_line\": 300 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nTotal lines: 391\nShowing lines 250-299:\n\n 250:     explanation.extend(\n 251:         line.strip() for line in difflib.ndiff(left_formatting, right_formatting)\n 252:     )\n 253:     return explanation\n 254: \n 255: \n 256: def _compare_eq_sequence(left, right, verbose=0):\n 257:     explanation = []\n 258:     len_left = len(left)\n 259:     len_right = len(right)\n 260:     for i in range(min(len_left, len_right)):\n 261:         if left[i] != right[i]:\n 262:             explanation += [\n 263:                 \"At index {} diff: {!r} != {!r}\".format(i, left[i], right[i])\n 264:             ]\n 265:             break\n 266:     len_diff = len_left - len_right\n 267: \n 268:     if len_diff:\n 269:         if len_diff > 0:\n 270:             dir_with_more = \"Left\"\n 271:             extra = saferepr(left[len_right])\n 272:         else:\n 273:             len_diff = 0 - len_diff\n 274:             dir_with_more = \"Right\"\n 275:             extra = saferepr(right[len_left])\n 276: \n 277:         if len_diff == 1:\n 278:             explanation += [\n 279:                 \"{} contains one more item: {}\".format(dir_with_more, extra)\n 280:             ]\n 281:         else:\n 282:             explanation += [\n 283:                 \"%s contains %d more items, first extra item: %s\"\n 284:                 % (dir_with_more, len_diff, extra)\n 285:             ]\n 286:     return explanation\n 287: \n 288: \n 289: def _compare_eq_set(left, right, verbose=0):\n 290:     explanation = []\n 291:     diff_left = left - right\n 292:     diff_right = right - left\n 293:     if diff_left:\n 294:         explanation.append(\"Extra items in the left set:\")\n 295:         for item in diff_left:\n 296:             explanation.append(saferepr(item))\n 297:     if diff_right:\n 298:         explanation.append(\"Extra items in the right set:\")\n 299:         for item in diff_right:\n\nNow I can see the issue clearly! The problem is in the `_compare_eq_sequence` function. When comparing byte strings, pytest treats them as sequences and when showing the \"first extra item\", it's displaying the raw byte value (ASCII ordinal) instead of the character representation.\n\nLet me look at how the comparison logic determines which comparison function to use:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_compare_eq_sequence\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_compare_eq_sequence' in directory (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nLines 129-135:\n 129:                 explanation = _diff_text(left, right, verbose)\n 130:             else:\n 131:                 if issequence(left) and issequence(right):\n 132:                     explanation = _compare_eq_sequence(left, right, verbose)\n 133:                 elif isset(left) and isset(right):\n 134:                     explanation = _compare_eq_set(left, right, verbose)\n 135:                 elif isdict(left) and isdict(right):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nLines 253-259:\n 253:     return explanation\n 254: \n 255: \n 256: def _compare_eq_sequence(left, right, verbose=0):\n 257:     explanation = []\n 258:     len_left = len(left)\n 259:     len_right = len(right)\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the bug. The issue is that when comparing byte strings of different lengths, pytest treats them as sequences and shows the ASCII ordinal value of the extra byte instead of the byte character representation.\n\nLet me check what the `issequence` function considers as sequences to understand why byte strings are being handled this way:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"def issequence\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'def issequence' in directory (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nLines 81-87:\n  81:     return result\n  82: \n  83: \n  84: def issequence(x):\n  85:     return isinstance(x, Sequence) and not isinstance(x, str)\n  86: \n  87: \n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: The `issequence()` function returns `True` for `bytes` objects because they inherit from `Sequence`, but when `_compare_eq_sequence()` indexes into a bytes object (e.g., `left[len_right]`), it returns an integer (ASCII ordinal) rather than a byte character.\n\n2. **Bug Location**: In `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`:\n   - Line 85: `issequence()` treats bytes as sequences\n   - Lines 131-132: The comparison logic routes bytes to `_compare_eq_sequence()`\n   - Lines 271 and 275: The problematic indexing that extracts raw byte values\n   - Lines 283-284: Where the confusing message is displayed\n\n3. **The Fix**: We need to add special handling for bytes objects before they get processed as generic sequences. The fix should be in the comparison routing logic (around lines 131-132) to handle bytes specially, or modify `_compare_eq_sequence()` to detect bytes and handle them appropriately.\n\nThe bug manifests in multiple related locations that need to be addressed together. I have enough information to identify the precise locations.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations:\n\n1. **Line 85**: `issequence()` function - This function incorrectly treats bytes as sequences without considering the special indexing behavior of bytes objects.\n\n2. **Lines 131-132**: Main comparison routing logic - This is where bytes objects get incorrectly routed to sequence comparison instead of getting special handling.\n\n3. **Lines 271 and 275**: Extra item extraction in `_compare_eq_sequence()` - These lines use direct indexing on bytes objects, which returns ASCII ordinals instead of byte characters.\n\n4. **Lines 283-284**: Error message formatting - Where the confusing ASCII ordinal values are displayed in the assertion failure message.\n\n5. **Lines 262-264**: Individual item comparison within sequences - This also affects how individual byte differences are displayed during sequence comparison.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where pytest displays confusing ASCII ordinal values (like \"52\" instead of \"b'4'\") when comparing byte strings of different lengths, I've identified the root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe bug occurs because pytest treats byte strings as sequences, and when indexing into a bytes object to show the \"first extra item\", it returns an integer (ASCII ordinal) rather than a byte character representation.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 84,\n            \"end_line\": 86\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 129,\n            \"end_line\": 135\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 268,\n            \"end_line\": 276\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 277,\n            \"end_line\": 285\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 260,\n            \"end_line\": 265\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug locations, here are my coordinated repair suggestions to fix the confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings:\n\n1. **[Lines 84-86] `issequence()` function**: Modify to exclude bytes objects from being treated as generic sequences:\n   ```python\n   def issequence(x):\n       return isinstance(x, Sequence) and not isinstance(x, (str, bytes))\n   ```\n   This prevents bytes from being routed to the problematic sequence comparison logic and allows them to be handled by the more appropriate text diff comparison.\n\n2. **[Lines 129-135] Main comparison routing logic**: This location will automatically benefit from fix #1, as bytes objects will no longer satisfy `issequence(left) and issequence(right)` and will fall through to the text comparison logic that already handles bytes properly with `_diff_text()`.\n\n3. **[Lines 268-276] Extra item extraction in `_compare_eq_sequence()`**: Add bytes detection as a safety net:\n   ```python\n   if len_diff:\n       if len_diff > 0:\n           dir_with_more = \"Left\"\n           if isinstance(left, bytes):\n               extra = saferepr(left[len_right:len_right+1])  # Get byte slice instead of ordinal\n           else:\n               extra = saferepr(left[len_right])\n       else:\n           len_diff = 0 -

Assertion Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: `/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Located the problematic function `_compare_eq_sequence()` (lines 256-286)\n  - Found the specific line causing the issue: line 283-284 where \"first extra item\" is displayed\n  - Identified that byte strings are treated as sequences, causing individual bytes to be shown as ASCII ordinals\n\n### 3. Root Cause Identification\n- **Problem Location**: `_compare_eq_sequence()` function in `/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`\n- **Issue**: When comparing byte strings of different lengths, the function uses `saferepr(left[len_right])` or `saferepr(right[len_left])` to show extra items\n- **Bug Mechanism**: For byte strings, indexing returns integer values (ASCII ordinals) rather than character representations\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Current Problematic Code Flow:\n1. Assertion comparison triggers in line 131-132 where `issequence(left) and issequence(right)` is true for byte strings\n2. `_compare_eq_sequence()` is called to handle the comparison\n3. When lengths differ, lines 271/275 extract extra items using indexing: `left[len_right]` or `right[len_left]`\n4. For byte strings, this indexing returns integer ASCII values instead of byte characters\n5. `saferepr()` then displays these integers, showing \"52\" instead of \"b'4'\"\n\n### Key Code Locations:\n- **Main comparison logic**: `/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, lines 129-135\n- **Sequence comparison function**: `/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, lines 256-286\n- **Problematic lines**: 271, 275, 283-284\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Root cause analysis and bug location identification\n- ✅ **Completed**: Understanding of the code flow and problem mechanism\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Ready to implement fix\n- ⏳ **Pending**: Fix implementation, testing, and validation\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify `_compare_eq_sequence()` to detect byte strings and handle them appropriately\n2. **Possible Solutions**:\n   - Add special handling for `bytes` type before the generic sequence comparison\n   - Modify the extra item extraction to preserve byte character representation\n   - Consider using slice notation `[start:start+1]` instead of indexing for bytes\n3. **Testing**: Create test cases to verify the fix works correctly\n4. **Validation**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality for other sequence types\n\n## Important Technical Considerations\n- The fix should maintain backward compatibility with existing sequence comparison behavior\n- Need to distinguish between `bytes` objects and other sequence types\n- The solution should preserve the helpful diff information while fixing the display issue\n- Consider edge cases like empty byte strings and mixed-type comparisons\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nStart line: 84\nEnd line: 86\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nStart line: 129\nEnd line: 135\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nStart line: 268\nEnd line: 276\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nStart line: 277\nEnd line: 285\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nStart line: 260\nEnd line: 265\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug locations, here are my coordinated repair suggestions to fix the confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings:\n\n1. **[Lines 84-86] `issequence()` function**: Modify to exclude bytes objects from being treated as generic sequences:\n   ```python\n   def issequence(x):\n       return isinstance(x, Sequence) and not isinstance(x, (str, bytes))\n   ```\n   This prevents bytes from being routed to the problematic sequence comparison logic and allows them to be handled by the more appropriate text diff comparison.\n\n2. **[Lines 129-135] Main comparison routing logic**: This location will automatically benefit from fix #1, as bytes objects will no longer satisfy `issequence(left) and issequence(right)` and will fall through to the text comparison logic that already handles bytes properly with `_diff_text()`.\n\n3. **[Lines 268-276] Extra item extraction in `_compare_eq_sequence()`**: Add bytes detection as a safety net:\n   ```python\n   if len_diff:\n       if len_diff > 0:\n           dir_with_more = \"Left\"\n           if isinstance(left, bytes):\n               extra = saferepr(left[len_right:len_right+1])  # Get byte slice instead of ordinal\n           else:\n               extra = saferepr(left[len_right])\n       else:\n           len_diff = 0 - len_diff\n           dir_with_more = \"Right\"\n           if isinstance(right, bytes):\n               extra = saferepr(right[len_left:len_left+1])  # Get byte slice instead of ordinal\n           else:\n               extra = saferepr(right[len_left])\n   ```\n\n4. **[Lines 277-285] Error message formatting**: This location will automatically display the correct representation once fix #3 provides proper byte character representation instead of ASCII ordinals.\n\n5. **[Lines 260-265] Individual item comparison**: Add similar bytes handling for consistency:\n   ```python\n   for i in range(min(len_left, len_right)):\n       if left[i] != right[i]:\n           if isinstance(left, bytes):\n               left_item = left[i:i+1]\n               right_item = right[i:i+1]\n           else:\n               left_item = left[i]\n               right_item = right[i]\n           explanation += [\n               \"At index {} diff: {!r} != {!r}\".format(i, left_item, right_item)\n           ]\n           break\n   ```\n\n**Coordination Strategy**: Fix #1 is the primary solution that prevents bytes from entering the problematic sequence comparison path entirely. Fixes #3 and #5 serve as defensive programming to handle any edge cases where bytes might still reach the sequence comparison logic. The routing logic (#2) and message formatting (#4) will automatically benefit from the other fixes without requiring changes.\nNote that the Patch provided should be a direct substitution of the location code by the Locator.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nPerfect! I found the issue. The problem is in the assertion utility code where it's treating byte strings as sequences and showing the ASCII ordinal values instead of the actual byte characters. Let me examine the specific function that handles sequence comparisons.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\", \"start_line\": 250, \"end_line\": 300 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nTotal lines: 391\nShowing lines 250-299:\n\n 250:     explanation.extend(\n 251:         line.strip() for line in difflib.ndiff(left_formatting, right_formatting)\n 252:     )\n 253:     return explanation\n 254: \n 255: \n 256: def _compare_eq_sequence(left, right, verbose=0):\n 257:     explanation = []\n 258:     len_left = len(left)\n 259:     len_right = len(right)\n 260:     for i in range(min(len_left, len_right)):\n 261:         if left[i] != right[i]:\n 262:             explanation += [\n 263:                 \"At index {} diff: {!r} != {!r}\".format(i, left[i], right[i])\n 264:             ]\n 265:             break\n 266:     len_diff = len_left - len_right\n 267: \n 268:     if len_diff:\n 269:         if len_diff > 0:\n 270:             dir_with_more = \"Left\"\n 271:             extra = saferepr(left[len_right])\n 272:         else:\n 273:             len_diff = 0 - len_diff\n 274:             dir_with_more = \"Right\"\n 275:             extra = saferepr(right[len_left])\n 276: \n 277:         if len_diff == 1:\n 278:             explanation += [\n 279:                 \"{} contains one more item: {}\".format(dir_with_more, extra)\n 280:             ]\n 281:         else:\n 282:             explanation += [\n 283:                 \"%s contains %d more items, first extra item: %s\"\n 284:                 % (dir_with_more, len_diff, extra)\n 285:             ]\n 286:     return explanation\n 287: \n 288: \n 289: def _compare_eq_set(left, right, verbose=0):\n 290:     explanation = []\n 291:     diff_left = left - right\n 292:     diff_right = right - left\n 293:     if diff_left:\n 294:         explanation.append(\"Extra items in the left set:\")\n 295:         for item in diff_left:\n 296:             explanation.append(saferepr(item))\n 297:     if diff_right:\n 298:         explanation.append(\"Extra items in the right set:\")\n 299:         for item in diff_right:\n\nNow I can see the issue clearly! The problem is in the `_compare_eq_sequence` function. When comparing byte strings, pytest treats them as sequences and when showing the \"first extra item\", it's displaying the raw byte value (ASCII ordinal) instead of the character representation.\n\nLet me look at how the comparison logic determines which comparison function to use:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_compare_eq_sequence\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_compare_eq_sequence' in directory (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nLines 129-135:\n 129:                 explanation = _diff_text(left, right, verbose)\n 130:             else:\n 131:                 if issequence(left) and issequence(right):\n 132:                     explanation = _compare_eq_sequence(left, right, verbose)\n 133:                 elif isset(left) and isset(right):\n 134:                     explanation = _compare_eq_set(left, right, verbose)\n 135:                 elif isdict(left) and isdict(right):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nLines 253-259:\n 253:     return explanation\n 254: \n 255: \n 256: def _compare_eq_sequence(left, right, verbose=0):\n 257:     explanation = []\n 258:     len_left = len(left)\n 259:     len_right = len(right)\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the bug. The issue is that when comparing byte strings of different lengths, pytest treats them as sequences and shows the ASCII ordinal value of the extra byte instead of the byte character representation.\n\nLet me check what the `issequence` function considers as sequences to understand why byte strings are being handled this way:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"def issequence\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'def issequence' in directory (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\nLines 81-87:\n  81:     return result\n  82: \n  83: \n  84: def issequence(x):\n  85:     return isinstance(x, Sequence) and not isinstance(x, str)\n  86: \n  87: \n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: The `issequence()` function returns `True` for `bytes` objects because they inherit from `Sequence`, but when `_compare_eq_sequence()` indexes into a bytes object (e.g., `left[len_right]`), it returns an integer (ASCII ordinal) rather than a byte character.\n\n2. **Bug Location**: In `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`:\n   - Line 85: `issequence()` treats bytes as sequences\n   - Lines 131-132: The comparison logic routes bytes to `_compare_eq_sequence()`\n   - Lines 271 and 275: The problematic indexing that extracts raw byte values\n   - Lines 283-284: Where the confusing message is displayed\n\n3. **The Fix**: We need to add special handling for bytes objects before they get processed as generic sequences. The fix should be in the comparison routing logic (around lines 131-132) to handle bytes specially, or modify `_compare_eq_sequence()` to detect bytes and handle them appropriately.\n\nThe bug manifests in multiple related locations that need to be addressed together. I have enough information to identify the precise locations.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations:\n\n1. **Line 85**: `issequence()` function - This function incorrectly treats bytes as sequences without considering the special indexing behavior of bytes objects.\n\n2. **Lines 131-132**: Main comparison routing logic - This is where bytes objects get incorrectly routed to sequence comparison instead of getting special handling.\n\n3. **Lines 271 and 275**: Extra item extraction in `_compare_eq_sequence()` - These lines use direct indexing on bytes objects, which returns ASCII ordinals instead of byte characters.\n\n4. **Lines 283-284**: Error message formatting - Where the confusing ASCII ordinal values are displayed in the assertion failure message.\n\n5. **Lines 262-264**: Individual item comparison within sequences - This also affects how individual byte differences are displayed during sequence comparison.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where pytest displays confusing ASCII ordinal values (like \"52\" instead of \"b'4'\") when comparing byte strings of different lengths, I've identified the root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe bug occurs because pytest treats byte strings as sequences, and when indexing into a bytes object to show the \"first extra item\", it returns an integer (ASCII ordinal) rather than a byte character representation.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 84,\n            \"end_line\": 86\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 129,\n            \"end_line\": 135\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 268,\n            \"end_line\": 276\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 277,\n            \"end_line\": 285\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/util.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 260,\n            \"end_line\": 265\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug locations, here are my coordinated repair suggestions to fix the confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings:\n\n1. **[Lines 84-86] `issequence()` function**: Modify to exclude bytes objects from being treated as generic sequences:\n   ```python\n   def issequence(x):\n       return isinstance(x, Sequence) and not isinstance(x, (str, bytes))\n   ```\n   This prevents bytes from being routed to the problematic sequence comparison logic and allows them to be handled by the more appropriate text diff comparison.\n\n2. **[Lines 129-135] Main comparison routing logic**: This location will automatically benefit from fix #1, as bytes objects will no longer satisfy `issequence(left) and issequence(right)` and will fall through to the text comparison logic that already handles bytes properly with `_diff_text()`.\n\n3. **[Lines 268-276] Extra item extraction in `_compare_eq_sequence()`**: Add bytes detection as a safety net:\n   ```python\n   if len_diff:\n       if len_diff > 0:\n           dir_with_more = \"Left\"\n           if isinstance(left, bytes):\n               extra = saferepr(left[len_right:len_right+1])  # Get byte slice instead of ordinal\n           else:\n               extra = saferepr(left[len_right])\n       else:\n           len_diff = 0 -

Fixes #3 and #5 serve as defensive programming to handle any edge cases where bytes might still reach the sequence comparison logic. The routing logic (#2) and message formatting (#4) will automatically benefit from the other fixes without requiring changes.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",
