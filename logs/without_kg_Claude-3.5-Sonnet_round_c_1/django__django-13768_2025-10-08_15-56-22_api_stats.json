This makes debugging difficult since developers have no visibility into receiver failures unless they explicitly check the method's return values.\n\n### Impact\n- Exceptions are silently caught and stored in response tuples\n- No logging occurs, making debugging invisible to error monitoring tools\n- Developers miss critical receiver failures that could indicate application issues\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**",

Now I have all the context I need. Looking at the test `test_send_robust_fail()` in lines 164-171, I can see that:\n\n1. The test creates a receiver that raises a `ValueError('this')`\n2. It calls `send_robust()` and expects the exception to be returned in the result\n3. The test verifies that the exception is properly caught and returned as `(receiver, exception)` tuple\n\nThis confirms the current behavior: exceptions are caught and returned but NOT logged. The bug is exactly as described - there's no logging of these exceptions, making debugging difficult for developers.\n\nNow let me examine the exact location where the fix needs to be applied:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\", \"start_line\": 205, \"end_line\": 215 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\nTotal lines: 294\nShowing lines 205-215:\n\n 205:         # Return a list of tuple pairs [(receiver, response), ... ].\n 206:         responses = []\n 207:         for receiver in self._live_receivers(sender):\n 208:             try:\n 209:                 response = receiver(signal=self, sender=sender, **named)\n 210:             except Exception as err:\n 211:                 responses.append((receiver, err))\n 212:             else:\n 213:                 responses.append((receiver, response))\n 214:         return responses\n 215: \n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have complete understanding of the bug and its location. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`, lines 208-211\n2. **Current Behavior**: The `send_robust()` method catches all exceptions from signal receivers but only stores them in the response list without logging\n3. **Problem**: Developers have no visibility into these exceptions unless they explicitly check return values, making debugging difficult\n4. **Expected Fix**: Add logging to the except clause so exceptions appear in error handling tools like Sentry\n\n**Code Context:**\n- Lines 208-211 contain the problematic exception handling\n- Line 210: `except Exception as err:` - catches the exception\n- Line 211: `responses.append((receiver, err))` - stores but doesn't log\n- The fix needs to add a `logger.exception()` call between lines 210-211\n\n**Required Changes:**\n1. **Import logging** (after line 3): `import logging`\n2. **Create logger instance** (after imports): `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`\n3. **Add logging call** (between lines 210-211): `logger.exception(\"Exception in signal receiver\")`\n\n**Test Coverage:**\n- `test_send_robust_fail()` confirms current behavior works correctly\n- The fix won't break existing functionality since it only adds logging\n- Current return behavior (storing exceptions in response list) will be preserved\n\nI have sufficient information to identify the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Location Analysis\n\nBased on my investigation of the Django signal system, I have identified the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n### Primary Bug Location\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`\n**Lines 210-211**: The exception handling block in `send_robust()` method\n```python\nexcept Exception as err:\n    responses.append((receiver, err))  # BUG: Exception stored but not logged\n```\n\n### Required Fix Locations\n\n1. **Import Section (Line 4)**: Add logging import\n   - **Location**: After line 3, before line 4\n   - **Fix**: Add `import logging`\n\n2. **Logger Instance Creation (Line 8)**: Create logger instance  \n   - **Location**: After line 7, before line 8\n   - **Fix**: Add `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`\n\n3. **Exception Logging (Line 211)**: Add logging call in except clause\n   - **Location**: Between lines 210-211 \n   - **Fix**: Add `logger.exception(\"Exception in signal receiver\")`\n\n### Root Cause\nThe `send_robust()` method is designed to catch all exceptions from signal receivers and continue processing, but it fails to log these exceptions. This makes debugging difficult since developers have no visibility into receiver failures unless they explicitly check the method's return values.\n\n### Impact\n- Exceptions are silently caught and stored in response tuples\n- No logging occurs, making debugging invisible to error monitoring tools\n- Developers miss critical receiver failures that could indicate application issues\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nLog exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()\nDescription\n\t\nAs pointed out by ​Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list.

Now I have all the context I need. Looking at the test `test_send_robust_fail()` in lines 164-171, I can see that:\n\n1. The test creates a receiver that raises a `ValueError('this')`\n2. It calls `send_robust()` and expects the exception to be returned in the result\n3. The test verifies that the exception is properly caught and returned as `(receiver, exception)` tuple\n\nThis confirms the current behavior: exceptions are caught and returned but NOT logged. The bug is exactly as described - there's no logging of these exceptions, making debugging difficult for developers.\n\nNow let me examine the exact location where the fix needs to be applied:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\", \"start_line\": 205, \"end_line\": 215 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\nTotal lines: 294\nShowing lines 205-215:\n\n 205:         # Return a list of tuple pairs [(receiver, response), ... ].\n 206:         responses = []\n 207:         for receiver in self._live_receivers(sender):\n 208:             try:\n 209:                 response = receiver(signal=self, sender=sender, **named)\n 210:             except Exception as err:\n 211:                 responses.append((receiver, err))\n 212:             else:\n 213:                 responses.append((receiver, response))\n 214:         return responses\n 215: \n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have complete understanding of the bug and its location. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`, lines 208-211\n2. **Current Behavior**: The `send_robust()` method catches all exceptions from signal receivers but only stores them in the response list without logging\n3. **Problem**: Developers have no visibility into these exceptions unless they explicitly check return values, making debugging difficult\n4. **Expected Fix**: Add logging to the except clause so exceptions appear in error handling tools like Sentry\n\n**Code Context:**\n- Lines 208-211 contain the problematic exception handling\n- Line 210: `except Exception as err:` - catches the exception\n- Line 211: `responses.append((receiver, err))` - stores but doesn't log\n- The fix needs to add a `logger.exception()` call between lines 210-211\n\n**Required Changes:**\n1. **Import logging** (after line 3): `import logging`\n2. **Create logger instance** (after imports): `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`\n3. **Add logging call** (between lines 210-211): `logger.exception(\"Exception in signal receiver\")`\n\n**Test Coverage:**\n- `test_send_robust_fail()` confirms current behavior works correctly\n- The fix won't break existing functionality since it only adds logging\n- Current return behavior (storing exceptions in response list) will be preserved\n\nI have sufficient information to identify the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Location Analysis\n\nBased on my investigation of the Django signal system, I have identified the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n### Primary Bug Location\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`\n**Lines 210-211**: The exception handling block in `send_robust()` method\n```python\nexcept Exception as err:\n    responses.append((receiver, err))  # BUG: Exception stored but not logged\n```\n\n### Required Fix Locations\n\n1. **Import Section (Line 4)**: Add logging import\n   - **Location**: After line 3, before line 4\n   - **Fix**: Add `import logging`\n\n2. **Logger Instance Creation (Line 8)**: Create logger instance  \n   - **Location**: After line 7, before line 8\n   - **Fix**: Add `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`\n\n3. **Exception Logging (Line 211)**: Add logging call in except clause\n   - **Location**: Between lines 210-211 \n   - **Fix**: Add `logger.exception(\"Exception in signal receiver\")`\n\n### Root Cause\nThe `send_robust()` method is designed to catch all exceptions from signal receivers and continue processing, but it fails to log these exceptions. This makes debugging difficult since developers have no visibility into receiver failures unless they explicitly check the method's return values.\n\n### Impact\n- Exceptions are silently caught and stored in response tuples\n- No logging occurs, making debugging invisible to error monitoring tools\n- Developers miss critical receiver failures that could indicate application issues\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my thorough analysis of the Django signal system and the specific bug described in the problem statement, I have identified the precise locations where the logging functionality needs to be added to fix the issue in `Signal.send_robust()`.\n\nThe bug is that exceptions raised by signal receivers are caught but not logged, making debugging difficult for developers. The fix requires adding logging import and exception logging in the except clause.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1,\n            \"end_line\": 7\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 208,\n            \"end_line\": 213\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe problem statement the project is:\nLog exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()\nDescription\n\t\nAs pointed out by ​Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n",

Adding a `logger.exception()` call in the except clause to log the exception\n\nLet me check if there are any tests related to this functionality to understand the expected behavior better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"send_robust\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'send_robust' in directory (showing first 8 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 143-149:\n 143:         a_signal.disconnect(dispatch_uid=\"uid\")\n 144:         self.assertTestIsClean(a_signal)\n 145: \n 146:     def test_send_robust_success(self):\n 147:         a_signal.connect(receiver_1_arg)\n 148:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 149:         self.assertEqual(result, [(receiver_1_arg, 'test')])\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 145-151:\n 145: \n 146:     def test_send_robust_success(self):\n 147:         a_signal.connect(receiver_1_arg)\n 148:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 149:         self.assertEqual(result, [(receiver_1_arg, 'test')])\n 150:         a_signal.disconnect(receiver_1_arg)\n 151:         self.assertTestIsClean(a_signal)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 150-156:\n 150:         a_signal.disconnect(receiver_1_arg)\n 151:         self.assertTestIsClean(a_signal)\n 152: \n 153:     def test_send_robust_no_receivers(self):\n 154:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 155:         self.assertEqual(result, [])\n 156: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 151-157:\n 151:         self.assertTestIsClean(a_signal)\n 152: \n 153:     def test_send_robust_no_receivers(self):\n 154:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 155:         self.assertEqual(result, [])\n 156: \n 157:     def test_send_robust_ignored_sender(self):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 154-160:\n 154:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 155:         self.assertEqual(result, [])\n 156: \n 157:     def test_send_robust_ignored_sender(self):\n 158:         a_signal.connect(receiver_1_arg)\n 159:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 160:         self.assertEqual(result, [(receiver_1_arg, 'test')])\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 156-162:\n 156: \n 157:     def test_send_robust_ignored_sender(self):\n 158:         a_signal.connect(receiver_1_arg)\n 159:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 160:         self.assertEqual(result, [(receiver_1_arg, 'test')])\n 161:         a_signal.disconnect(receiver_1_arg)\n 162:         self.assertTestIsClean(a_signal)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 161-167:\n 161:         a_signal.disconnect(receiver_1_arg)\n 162:         self.assertTestIsClean(a_signal)\n 163: \n 164:     def test_send_robust_fail(self):\n 165:         def fails(val, **kwargs):\n 166:             raise ValueError('this')\n 167:         a_signal.connect(fails)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 165-171:\n 165:         def fails(val, **kwargs):\n 166:             raise ValueError('this')\n 167:         a_signal.connect(fails)\n 168:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val=\"test\")\n 169:         err = result[0][1]\n 170:         self.assertIsInstance(err, ValueError)\n 171:         self.assertEqual(err.args, ('this',))\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect! Now I have all the context I need. Looking at the test `test_send_robust_fail()` in lines 164-171, I can see that:\n\n1. The test creates a receiver that raises a `ValueError('this')`\n2. It calls `send_robust()` and expects the exception to be returned in the result\n3. The test verifies that the exception is properly caught and returned as `(receiver, exception)` tuple\n\nThis confirms the current behavior: exceptions are caught and returned but NOT logged. The bug is exactly as described - there's no logging of these exceptions, making debugging difficult for developers.\n\nNow let me examine the exact location where the fix needs to be applied:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\", \"start_line\": 205, \"end_line\": 215 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\nTotal lines: 294\nShowing lines 205-215:\n\n 205:         # Return a list of tuple pairs [(receiver, response), ... ].\n 206:         responses = []\n 207:         for receiver in self._live_receivers(sender):\n 208:             try:\n 209:                 response = receiver(signal=self, sender=sender, **named)\n 210:             except Exception as err:\n 211:                 responses.append((receiver, err))\n 212:             else:\n 213:                 responses.append((receiver, response))\n 214:         return responses\n 215: \n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have complete understanding of the bug and its location. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`, lines 208-211\n2. **Current Behavior**: The `send_robust()` method catches all exceptions from signal receivers but only stores them in the response list without logging\n3. **Problem**: Developers have no visibility into these exceptions unless they explicitly check return values, making debugging difficult\n4. **Expected Fix**: Add logging to the except clause so exceptions appear in error handling tools like Sentry\n\n**Code Context:**\n- Lines 208-211 contain the problematic exception handling\n- Line 210: `except Exception as err:` - catches the exception\n- Line 211: `responses.append((receiver, err))` - stores but doesn't log\n- The fix needs to add a `logger.exception()` call between lines 210-211\n\n**Required Changes:**\n1. **Import logging** (after line 3): `import logging`\n2. **Create logger instance** (after imports): `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`\n3. **Add logging call** (between lines 210-211): `logger.exception(\"Exception in signal receiver\")`\n\n**Test Coverage:**\n- `test_send_robust_fail()` confirms current behavior works correctly\n- The fix won't break existing functionality since it only adds logging\n- Current return behavior (storing exceptions in response list) will be preserved\n\nI have sufficient information to identify the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Location Analysis\n\nBased on my investigation of the Django signal system, I have identified the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n### Primary Bug Location\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`\n**Lines 210-211**: The exception handling block in `send_robust()` method\n```python\nexcept Exception as err:\n    responses.append((receiver, err))  # BUG: Exception stored but not logged\n```\n\n### Required Fix Locations\n\n1. **Import Section (Line 4)**: Add logging import\n   - **Location**: After line 3, before line 4\n   - **Fix**: Add `import logging`\n\n2. **Logger Instance Creation (Line 8)**: Create logger instance  \n   - **Location**: After line 7, before line 8\n   - **Fix**: Add `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`\n\n3. **Exception Logging (Line 211)**: Add logging call in except clause\n   - **Location**: Between lines 210-211 \n   - **Fix**: Add `logger.exception(\"Exception in signal receiver\")`\n\n### Root Cause\nThe `send_robust()` method is designed to catch all exceptions from signal receivers and continue processing, but it fails to log these exceptions. This makes debugging difficult since developers have no visibility into receiver failures unless they explicitly check the method's return values.\n\n### Impact\n- Exceptions are silently caught and stored in response tuples\n- No logging occurs, making debugging invisible to error monitoring tools\n- Developers miss critical receiver failures that could indicate application issues\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my thorough analysis of the Django signal system and the specific bug described in the problem statement, I have identified the precise locations where the logging functionality needs to be added to fix the issue in `Signal.send_robust()`.\n\nThe bug is that exceptions raised by signal receivers are caught but not logged, making debugging difficult for developers. The fix requires adding logging import and exception logging in the except clause.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1,\n            \"end_line\": 7\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 208,\n            \"end_line\": 213\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem statement confirms exactly what I identified:\n\n1. **Issue**: `Signal.send_robust()` doesn't log exceptions raised in receivers\n2. **Impact**: Users can't see these exceptions in error handling tools like Sentry\n3. **Solution**: Add `logger.exception()` call in the except clause of `send_robust()`\n4. **Rationale**: Django logs exceptions in other similar situations (like missing template variables), so this would be consistent\n\nThe two suspicious locations provided by the Locator are:\n1. **Lines 1-7**: Import section - where we need to add `import logging`\n2. **Lines 208-213**: The `send_robust()` exception handling block - where we need to add the logging call\n\nThis matches perfectly with my analysis. The fix needs to:\n1. Add logging import at the top\n2. Add logger.exception() call in the except clause (around line 210-211)\n\nI have all the information needed to propose specific repair suggestions.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django signal system and the specific problem statement, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for the two interconnected bug locations:\n\n**1. [Lines 1-7 - Import Section]**: Add logging import to enable exception logging functionality\n   - **Action**: Insert `import logging` after line 3 (after `import weakref`)\n   - **Rationale**: This provides the logging module needed for the exception logging in location 2\n   - **Coordination**: This import directly supports the logging call that will be added in the exception handler\n\n**2. [Lines 208-213 - Exception Handler]**: Add logger.exception() call to log caught exceptions\n   - **Action**: Insert `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` after the imports section (around line 8)\n   - **Action**: Insert `logger.exception(\"Exception in signal receiver\")` between lines 210-211 (right after `except Exception as err:` and before `responses.append((receiver, err))`)\n   - **Rationale**: This logs exceptions to make them visible in error handling tools like Sentry, while preserving the existing behavior of storing exceptions in the response list\n   - **Coordination**: This depends on the logging import from location 1 and maintains backward compatibility by keeping the existing `responses.append((receiver, err))` behavior\n\n**Interconnection**: These fixes work together as a cohesive solution - the import enables the logging functionality, and the exception logging provides the visibility that developers need while maintaining Django's existing robust exception handling pattern. The fix follows Django's established pattern of logging exceptions in similar situations (like missing template variables) and allows users to see receiver exceptions in their monitoring tools.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py lines 1-7\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport threading\nimport warnings\nimport weakref\n\nfrom django.utils.deprecation import RemovedInDjango40Warning\nfrom django.utils.inspect import func_accepts_kwargs\n\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py lines 208-213\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            try:\n                response = receiver(signal=self, sender=sender, **named)\n            except Exception as err:\n                responses.append((receiver, err))\n            else:\n                responses.append((receiver, response))\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nLog exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()\nDescription\n\t\nAs pointed out by ​Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nLooking at the two code segments provided, I can see:\n\n**Location 1 (Lines 1-7)**: The import section shows the current imports:\n- `import threading`\n- `import warnings` \n- `import weakref`\n- Django utility imports\n\nThis is where I need to add `import logging` to enable the logging functionality.\n\n**Location 2 (Lines 208-213)**: The exception handling block in `send_robust()`:\n```python\ntry:\n    response = receiver(signal=self, sender=sender, **named)\nexcept Exception as err:\n    responses.append((receiver, err))  # BUG: No logging here\nelse:\n    responses.append((receiver, response))\n```\n\nThis is exactly where the bug is - exceptions are caught and stored but not logged.

Adding a `logger.exception()` call in the except clause to log the exception\n\nLet me check if there are any tests related to this functionality to understand the expected behavior better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"send_robust\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/tests\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'send_robust' in directory (showing first 8 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 143-149:\n 143:         a_signal.disconnect(dispatch_uid=\"uid\")\n 144:         self.assertTestIsClean(a_signal)\n 145: \n 146:     def test_send_robust_success(self):\n 147:         a_signal.connect(receiver_1_arg)\n 148:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 149:         self.assertEqual(result, [(receiver_1_arg, 'test')])\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 145-151:\n 145: \n 146:     def test_send_robust_success(self):\n 147:         a_signal.connect(receiver_1_arg)\n 148:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 149:         self.assertEqual(result, [(receiver_1_arg, 'test')])\n 150:         a_signal.disconnect(receiver_1_arg)\n 151:         self.assertTestIsClean(a_signal)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 150-156:\n 150:         a_signal.disconnect(receiver_1_arg)\n 151:         self.assertTestIsClean(a_signal)\n 152: \n 153:     def test_send_robust_no_receivers(self):\n 154:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 155:         self.assertEqual(result, [])\n 156: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 151-157:\n 151:         self.assertTestIsClean(a_signal)\n 152: \n 153:     def test_send_robust_no_receivers(self):\n 154:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 155:         self.assertEqual(result, [])\n 156: \n 157:     def test_send_robust_ignored_sender(self):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 154-160:\n 154:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 155:         self.assertEqual(result, [])\n 156: \n 157:     def test_send_robust_ignored_sender(self):\n 158:         a_signal.connect(receiver_1_arg)\n 159:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 160:         self.assertEqual(result, [(receiver_1_arg, 'test')])\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 156-162:\n 156: \n 157:     def test_send_robust_ignored_sender(self):\n 158:         a_signal.connect(receiver_1_arg)\n 159:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val='test')\n 160:         self.assertEqual(result, [(receiver_1_arg, 'test')])\n 161:         a_signal.disconnect(receiver_1_arg)\n 162:         self.assertTestIsClean(a_signal)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 161-167:\n 161:         a_signal.disconnect(receiver_1_arg)\n 162:         self.assertTestIsClean(a_signal)\n 163: \n 164:     def test_send_robust_fail(self):\n 165:         def fails(val, **kwargs):\n 166:             raise ValueError('this')\n 167:         a_signal.connect(fails)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/tests/dispatch/tests.py\nLines 165-171:\n 165:         def fails(val, **kwargs):\n 166:             raise ValueError('this')\n 167:         a_signal.connect(fails)\n 168:         result = a_signal.send_robust(sender=self, val=\"test\")\n 169:         err = result[0][1]\n 170:         self.assertIsInstance(err, ValueError)\n 171:         self.assertEqual(err.args, ('this',))\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect! Now I have all the context I need. Looking at the test `test_send_robust_fail()` in lines 164-171, I can see that:\n\n1. The test creates a receiver that raises a `ValueError('this')`\n2. It calls `send_robust()` and expects the exception to be returned in the result\n3. The test verifies that the exception is properly caught and returned as `(receiver, exception)` tuple\n\nThis confirms the current behavior: exceptions are caught and returned but NOT logged. The bug is exactly as described - there's no logging of these exceptions, making debugging difficult for developers.\n\nNow let me examine the exact location where the fix needs to be applied:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\", \"start_line\": 205, \"end_line\": 215 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\nTotal lines: 294\nShowing lines 205-215:\n\n 205:         # Return a list of tuple pairs [(receiver, response), ... ].\n 206:         responses = []\n 207:         for receiver in self._live_receivers(sender):\n 208:             try:\n 209:                 response = receiver(signal=self, sender=sender, **named)\n 210:             except Exception as err:\n 211:                 responses.append((receiver, err))\n 212:             else:\n 213:                 responses.append((receiver, response))\n 214:         return responses\n 215: \n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have complete understanding of the bug and its location. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`, lines 208-211\n2. **Current Behavior**: The `send_robust()` method catches all exceptions from signal receivers but only stores them in the response list without logging\n3. **Problem**: Developers have no visibility into these exceptions unless they explicitly check return values, making debugging difficult\n4. **Expected Fix**: Add logging to the except clause so exceptions appear in error handling tools like Sentry\n\n**Code Context:**\n- Lines 208-211 contain the problematic exception handling\n- Line 210: `except Exception as err:` - catches the exception\n- Line 211: `responses.append((receiver, err))` - stores but doesn't log\n- The fix needs to add a `logger.exception()` call between lines 210-211\n\n**Required Changes:**\n1. **Import logging** (after line 3): `import logging`\n2. **Create logger instance** (after imports): `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`\n3. **Add logging call** (between lines 210-211): `logger.exception(\"Exception in signal receiver\")`\n\n**Test Coverage:**\n- `test_send_robust_fail()` confirms current behavior works correctly\n- The fix won't break existing functionality since it only adds logging\n- Current return behavior (storing exceptions in response list) will be preserved\n\nI have sufficient information to identify the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Location Analysis\n\nBased on my investigation of the Django signal system, I have identified the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n### Primary Bug Location\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`\n**Lines 210-211**: The exception handling block in `send_robust()` method\n```python\nexcept Exception as err:\n    responses.append((receiver, err))  # BUG: Exception stored but not logged\n```\n\n### Required Fix Locations\n\n1. **Import Section (Line 4)**: Add logging import\n   - **Location**: After line 3, before line 4\n   - **Fix**: Add `import logging`\n\n2. **Logger Instance Creation (Line 8)**: Create logger instance  \n   - **Location**: After line 7, before line 8\n   - **Fix**: Add `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`\n\n3. **Exception Logging (Line 211)**: Add logging call in except clause\n   - **Location**: Between lines 210-211 \n   - **Fix**: Add `logger.exception(\"Exception in signal receiver\")`\n\n### Root Cause\nThe `send_robust()` method is designed to catch all exceptions from signal receivers and continue processing, but it fails to log these exceptions. This makes debugging difficult since developers have no visibility into receiver failures unless they explicitly check the method's return values.\n\n### Impact\n- Exceptions are silently caught and stored in response tuples\n- No logging occurs, making debugging invisible to error monitoring tools\n- Developers miss critical receiver failures that could indicate application issues\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my thorough analysis of the Django signal system and the specific bug described in the problem statement, I have identified the precise locations where the logging functionality needs to be added to fix the issue in `Signal.send_robust()`.\n\nThe bug is that exceptions raised by signal receivers are caught but not logged, making debugging difficult for developers. The fix requires adding logging import and exception logging in the except clause.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1,\n            \"end_line\": 7\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 208,\n            \"end_line\": 213\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem statement confirms exactly what I identified:\n\n1. **Issue**: `Signal.send_robust()` doesn't log exceptions raised in receivers\n2. **Impact**: Users can't see these exceptions in error handling tools like Sentry\n3. **Solution**: Add `logger.exception()` call in the except clause of `send_robust()`\n4. **Rationale**: Django logs exceptions in other similar situations (like missing template variables), so this would be consistent\n\nThe two suspicious locations provided by the Locator are:\n1. **Lines 1-7**: Import section - where we need to add `import logging`\n2. **Lines 208-213**: The `send_robust()` exception handling block - where we need to add the logging call\n\nThis matches perfectly with my analysis. The fix needs to:\n1. Add logging import at the top\n2. Add logger.exception() call in the except clause (around line 210-211)\n\nI have all the information needed to propose specific repair suggestions.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django signal system and the specific problem statement, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for the two interconnected bug locations:\n\n**1. [Lines 1-7 - Import Section]**: Add logging import to enable exception logging functionality\n   - **Action**: Insert `import logging` after line 3 (after `import weakref`)\n   - **Rationale**: This provides the logging module needed for the exception logging in location 2\n   - **Coordination**: This import directly supports the logging call that will be added in the exception handler\n\n**2. [Lines 208-213 - Exception Handler]**: Add logger.exception() call to log caught exceptions\n   - **Action**: Insert `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` after the imports section (around line 8)\n   - **Action**: Insert `logger.exception(\"Exception in signal receiver\")` between lines 210-211 (right after `except Exception as err:` and before `responses.append((receiver, err))`)\n   - **Rationale**: This logs exceptions to make them visible in error handling tools like Sentry, while preserving the existing behavior of storing exceptions in the response list\n   - **Coordination**: This depends on the logging import from location 1 and maintains backward compatibility by keeping the existing `responses.append((receiver, err))` behavior\n\n**Interconnection**: These fixes work together as a cohesive solution - the import enables the logging functionality, and the exception logging provides the visibility that developers need while maintaining Django's existing robust exception handling pattern. The fix follows Django's established pattern of logging exceptions in similar situations (like missing template variables) and allows users to see receiver exceptions in their monitoring tools.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py lines 1-7\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nimport threading\nimport warnings\nimport weakref\n\nfrom django.utils.deprecation import RemovedInDjango40Warning\nfrom django.utils.inspect import func_accepts_kwargs\n\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py lines 208-213\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            try:\n                response = receiver(signal=self, sender=sender, **named)\n            except Exception as err:\n                responses.append((receiver, err))\n            else:\n                responses.append((receiver, response))\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n#REFLECT\nLooking at the two code segments provided, I can see:\n\n**Location 1 (Lines 1-7)**: The import section shows the current imports:\n- `import threading`\n- `import warnings` \n- `import weakref`\n- Django utility imports\n\nThis is where I need to add `import logging` to enable the logging functionality.\n\n**Location 2 (Lines 208-213)**: The exception handling block in `send_robust()`:\n```python\ntry:\n    response = receiver(signal=self, sender=sender, **named)\nexcept Exception as err:\n    responses.append((receiver, err))  # BUG: No logging here\nelse:\n    responses.append((receiver, response))\n```\n\nThis is exactly where the bug is - exceptions are caught and stored but not logged.

The fix is straightforward:\n1. Add logging import in location 1\n2. Add logger instance creation after imports\n3.

Add `import logging` in the import section (Location 1)\n2. Create a logger instance after the imports\n3. Add `logger.exception(\"Exception in signal receiver\")` in the except clause (Location 2)\n\nThis will make exceptions visible in error handling tools like Sentry while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing behavior of storing exceptions in the response list.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py lines 1-7\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import threading\n  import warnings\n  import weakref\n  from django.utils.deprecation import RemovedInDjango40Warning\n  from django.utils.inspect import func_accepts_kwargs\n  from django.conf import settings\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[R]    1: import threading\n[R]    2: import warnings\n[R]    3: import weakref\n[R]    4: \n[R]    5: from django.utils.deprecation import RemovedInDjango40Warning\n[R]    6: from django.utils.inspect import func_accepts_kwargs\n[R]    7: \n[C]    8: \n[C]    9: def _make_id(target):\n[C]   10:     if hasattr(target, '__func__'):\n[C]   11:         return (id(target.__self__), id(target.__func__))\n[C]   12:     return id(target)\n[C]   13: \n[C]   14: \n[C]   15: NONE_ID = _make_id(None)\n[C]   16: \n[C]   17: # A marker for caching\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py lines 208-213\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import threading\n  import warnings\n  import weakref\n  from django.utils.deprecation import RemovedInDjango40Warning\n  from django.utils.inspect import func_accepts_kwargs\n  from django.conf import settings\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  198:         If any receiver raises an error (specifically any subclass of\n[C]  199:         Exception), return the error instance as the result for that receiver.\n[C]  200:         \"\"\"\n[C]  201:         if not self.receivers or self.sender_receivers_cache.get(sender) is NO_RECEIVERS:\n[C]  202:             return []\n[C]  203: \n[C]  204:         # Call each receiver with whatever arguments it can accept.\n[C]  205:         # Return a list of tuple pairs [(receiver, response), ... ].\n[C]  206:         responses = []\n[C]  207:         for receiver in self._live_receivers(sender):\n[R]  208:             try:\n[R]  209:                 response = receiver(signal=self, sender=sender, **named)\n[R]  210:             except Exception as err:\n[R]  211:                 responses.append((receiver, err))\n[R]  212:             else:\n[R]  213:                 responses.append((receiver, response))\n[C]  214:         return responses\n[C]  215: \n[C]  216:     def _clear_dead_receivers(self):\n[C]  217:         # Note: caller is assumed to hold self.lock.\n[C]  218:         if self._dead_receivers:\n[C]  219:             self._dead_receivers = False\n[C]  220:             self.receivers = [\n[C]  221:                 r for r in self.receivers\n[C]  222:                 if not(isinstance(r[1], weakref.ReferenceType) and r[1]() is None)\n[C]  223:             ]\n\nYou must pay close attention to **indentation** — especially the relative indentation level between the patch and its parent scope (for example, the containing class or function).\n⚠️ **Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n⚠️ **Do not combine fixes for different locations into one block** — every location's fix should be in a **separate** ```python```code block.\n\nHere are the suggestions from the Suggester:\n#REFLECT\nPerfect!

Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there.
