    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug. Looking at the `_get_assertion_exprs` function, I can see the issue:\n\n**The Problem**: In Python 3.9, when pytest encounters an assertion followed by a decorator (like `@t`), the tokenizer is incorrectly including the decorator line in the assertion expression. This happens in lines 605-607 where the function adds any new line that hasn't been seen before.\n\n**Root Cause**: The logic at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis condition adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and it's now including the decorator line `@t` as part of the token stream for the assertion, causing it to be added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Fix Needed**: The function should stop collecting lines when it encounters a decorator or other non-assertion related tokens. The current logic doesn't have a proper termination condition for when to stop collecting assertion-related lines.\n\nLet me examine how this function is called and what tokens are being processed to understand the exact flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_get_assertion_exprs\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/\" }",

The issue appears to be related to how pytest calculates and extracts line numbers for assertion error reporting.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: \n  - Located pytest source code in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/`\n  - Identified assertion handling code in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/`\n  - Found key files: `rewrite.py`, `util.py`, `truncate.py`, `__init__.py`\n\n### 2. Assertion Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Located the `_get_assertion_exprs()` function in `rewrite.py` (lines 556-609)\n  - This function is responsible for extracting assertion expressions and determining which lines to include in error messages\n  - Uses tokenization to parse source code and track assertion statements\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### Critical Function: `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n- **Purpose**: Returns a mapping from line numbers to assertion test expressions\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, lines 556-609\n- **Key Logic**:\n  - Uses `tokenize.tokenize()` to parse source code\n  - Tracks assertion statements by looking for `tokenize.NAME` tokens with value \"assert\"\n  - Maintains depth tracking for parentheses/brackets to handle multi-line assertions\n  - Collects lines in a `lines` list and tracks `seen_lines` to avoid duplicates\n  - **Critical Issue Area**: Lines 605-607 handle adding new lines when `lineno not in seen_lines`\n\n### Potential Bug Location\nThe bug likely occurs in the line collection logic (lines 605-607):\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis logic may be incorrectly including decorator lines that precede assertion statements in Python 3.9 due to changes in how Python 3.9 handles line number attribution for decorated functions.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Project structure mapped\n- Assertion handling code located\n- Key function `_get_assertion_exprs()` identified\n- Understanding of tokenization-based line extraction approach\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Detailed analysis of line number calculation logic\n- Need to understand Python 3.9-specific changes that might affect tokenization\n\n### ⏳ Next Steps Required\n1. **Create test case** to reproduce the bug with decorator + assertion scenario\n2. **Analyze tokenization behavior** differences between Python versions\n3. **Debug line collection logic** in `_get_assertion_exprs()` \n4. **Implement fix** to properly filter out decorator lines from assertion error messages\n5. **Test fix** across different Python versions\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: For project structure navigation\n- `read_file_lines`: For examining specific code sections\n- `search_code_with_context`: For finding line number-related code\n\n## Key Technical Context\nThe bug appears to be in pytest's assertion rewriting system, specifically in how it determines which source code lines to include when displaying assertion failures.

Looking at the `_get_assertion_exprs` function, I can see the issue:\n\n**The Problem**: In Python 3.9, when pytest encounters an assertion followed by a decorator (like `@t`), the tokenizer is incorrectly including the decorator line in the assertion expression. This happens in lines 605-607 where the function adds any new line that hasn't been seen before.\n\n**Root Cause**: The logic at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis condition adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and it's now including the decorator line `@t` as part of the token stream for the assertion, causing it to be added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Fix Needed**: The function should stop collecting lines when it encounters a decorator or other non-assertion related tokens. The current logic doesn't have a proper termination condition for when to stop collecting assertion-related lines.\n\nLet me examine how this function is called and what tokens are being processed to understand the exact flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_get_assertion_exprs\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_get_assertion_exprs' in directory (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 555-561:\n 555: \n 556: \n 557: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n 558: def _get_assertion_exprs(src: bytes) -> Dict[int, str]:\n 559:     \"\"\"Return a mapping from {lineno: \"assertion test expression\"}.\"\"\"\n 560:     ret: Dict[int, str] = {}\n 561: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 903-909:\n 903: \n 904:             # Passed\n 905:             fmt_pass = self.helper(\"_format_explanation\", msg)\n 906:             orig = _get_assertion_exprs(self.source)[assert_.lineno]\n 907:             hook_call_pass = ast.Expr(\n 908:                 self.helper(\n 909:                     \"_call_assertion_pass\",\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1.

The issue is likely related to Python 3.9's changes in line number attribution for decorated functions, causing pytest to incorrectly include decorator lines in assertion error output.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nLet me examine the `_get_assertion_exprs` function more closely, as this seems to be where pytest extracts assertion expressions and determines which lines to include in error messages:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\", \"start_line\": 556, \"end_line\": 620 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nTotal lines: 1134\nShowing lines 556-605:\n\n 556: \n 557: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n 558: def _get_assertion_exprs(src: bytes) -> Dict[int, str]:\n 559:     \"\"\"Return a mapping from {lineno: \"assertion test expression\"}.\"\"\"\n 560:     ret: Dict[int, str] = {}\n 561: \n 562:     depth = 0\n 563:     lines: List[str] = []\n 564:     assert_lineno: Optional[int] = None\n 565:     seen_lines: Set[int] = set()\n 566: \n 567:     def _write_and_reset() -> None:\n 568:         nonlocal depth, lines, assert_lineno, seen_lines\n 569:         assert assert_lineno is not None\n 570:         ret[assert_lineno] = \"\".join(lines).rstrip().rstrip(\"\\\\\")\n 571:         depth = 0\n 572:         lines = []\n 573:         assert_lineno = None\n 574:         seen_lines = set()\n 575: \n 576:     tokens = tokenize.tokenize(io.BytesIO(src).readline)\n 577:     for tp, source, (lineno, offset), _, line in tokens:\n 578:         if tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\":\n 579:             assert_lineno = lineno\n 580:         elif assert_lineno is not None:\n 581:             # keep track of depth for the assert-message `,` lookup\n 582:             if tp == tokenize.OP and source in \"([{\":\n 583:                 depth += 1\n 584:             elif tp == tokenize.OP and source in \")]}\":\n 585:                 depth -= 1\n 586: \n 587:             if not lines:\n 588:                 lines.append(line[offset:])\n 589:                 seen_lines.add(lineno)\n 590:             # a non-nested comma separates the expression from the message\n 591:             elif depth == 0 and tp == tokenize.OP and source == \",\":\n 592:                 # one line assert with message\n 593:                 if lineno in seen_lines and len(lines) == 1:\n 594:                     offset_in_trimmed = offset + len(lines[-1]) - len(line)\n 595:                     lines[-1] = lines[-1][:offset_in_trimmed]\n 596:                 # multi-line assert with message\n 597:                 elif lineno in seen_lines:\n 598:                     lines[-1] = lines[-1][:offset]\n 599:                 # multi line assert with escapd newline before message\n 600:                 else:\n 601:                     lines.append(line[:offset])\n 602:                 _write_and_reset()\n 603:             elif tp in {tokenize.NEWLINE, tokenize.ENDMARKER}:\n 604:                 _write_and_reset()\n 605:             elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n\nNow let me continue reading the `_get_assertion_exprs` function to see how it handles line collection:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\", \"start_line\": 605, \"end_line\": 620 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nTotal lines: 1134\nShowing lines 605-620:\n\n 605:             elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n 606:                 lines.append(line)\n 607:                 seen_lines.add(lineno)\n 608: \n 609:     return ret\n 610: \n 611: \n 612: class AssertionRewriter(ast.NodeVisitor):\n 613:     \"\"\"Assertion rewriting implementation.\n 614: \n 615:     The main entrypoint is to call .run() with an ast.Module instance,\n 616:     this will then find all the assert statements and rewrite them to\n 617:     provide intermediate values and a detailed assertion error.

Looking at the `_get_assertion_exprs` function, I can see the issue:\n\n**The Problem**: In Python 3.9, when pytest encounters an assertion followed by a decorator (like `@t`), the tokenizer is incorrectly including the decorator line in the assertion expression. This happens in lines 605-607 where the function adds any new line that hasn't been seen before.\n\n**Root Cause**: The logic at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis condition adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and it's now including the decorator line `@t` as part of the token stream for the assertion, causing it to be added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Fix Needed**: The function should stop collecting lines when it encounters a decorator or other non-assertion related tokens. The current logic doesn't have a proper termination condition for when to stop collecting assertion-related lines.\n\nLet me examine how this function is called and what tokens are being processed to understand the exact flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_get_assertion_exprs\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_get_assertion_exprs' in directory (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 555-561:\n 555: \n 556: \n 557: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n 558: def _get_assertion_exprs(src: bytes) -> Dict[int, str]:\n 559:     \"\"\"Return a mapping from {lineno: \"assertion test expression\"}.\"\"\"\n 560:     ret: Dict[int, str] = {}\n 561: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 903-909:\n 903: \n 904:             # Passed\n 905:             fmt_pass = self.helper(\"_format_explanation\", msg)\n 906:             orig = _get_assertion_exprs(self.source)[assert_.lineno]\n 907:             hook_call_pass = ast.Expr(\n 908:                 self.helper(\n 909:                     \"_call_assertion_pass\",\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nNow let me look at how the assertion expressions are used in the error formatting to understand the complete flow:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_format_explanation\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_format_explanation' in directory (showing first 4 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 33-39:\n  33: from _pytest._version import version\n  34: from _pytest.assertion import util\n  35: from _pytest.assertion.util import (  # noqa: F401\n  36:     format_explanation as _format_explanation,\n  37: )\n  38: from _pytest.config import Config\n  39: from _pytest.main import Session\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 894-900:\n 894:             err_explanation = ast.BinOp(ast.Str(gluestr), ast.Add(), msg)\n 895:             err_msg = ast.BinOp(assertmsg, ast.Add(), err_explanation)\n 896:             err_name = ast.Name(\"AssertionError\", ast.Load())\n 897:             fmt = self.helper(\"_format_explanation\", err_msg)\n 898:             exc = ast.Call(err_name, [fmt], [])\n 899:             raise_ = ast.Raise(exc, None)\n 900:             statements_fail = []\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 902-908:\n 902:             statements_fail.append(raise_)\n 903: \n 904:             # Passed\n 905:             fmt_pass = self.helper(\"_format_explanation\", msg)\n 906:             orig = _get_assertion_exprs(self.source)[assert_.lineno]\n 907:             hook_call_pass = ast.Expr(\n 908:                 self.helper(\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 942-948:\n 942:                 explanation = \"assert \" + explanation\n 943:             template = ast.BinOp(assertmsg, ast.Add(), ast.Str(explanation))\n 944:             msg = self.pop_format_context(template)\n 945:             fmt = self.helper(\"_format_explanation\", msg)\n 946:             err_name = ast.Name(\"AssertionError\", ast.Load())\n 947:             exc = ast.Call(err_name, [fmt], [])\n 948:             raise_ = ast.Raise(exc, None)\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1.

The issue is likely related to Python 3.9's changes in line number attribution for decorated functions, causing pytest to incorrectly include decorator lines in assertion error output.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nLet me examine the `_get_assertion_exprs` function more closely, as this seems to be where pytest extracts assertion expressions and determines which lines to include in error messages:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\", \"start_line\": 556, \"end_line\": 620 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nTotal lines: 1134\nShowing lines 556-605:\n\n 556: \n 557: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n 558: def _get_assertion_exprs(src: bytes) -> Dict[int, str]:\n 559:     \"\"\"Return a mapping from {lineno: \"assertion test expression\"}.\"\"\"\n 560:     ret: Dict[int, str] = {}\n 561: \n 562:     depth = 0\n 563:     lines: List[str] = []\n 564:     assert_lineno: Optional[int] = None\n 565:     seen_lines: Set[int] = set()\n 566: \n 567:     def _write_and_reset() -> None:\n 568:         nonlocal depth, lines, assert_lineno, seen_lines\n 569:         assert assert_lineno is not None\n 570:         ret[assert_lineno] = \"\".join(lines).rstrip().rstrip(\"\\\\\")\n 571:         depth = 0\n 572:         lines = []\n 573:         assert_lineno = None\n 574:         seen_lines = set()\n 575: \n 576:     tokens = tokenize.tokenize(io.BytesIO(src).readline)\n 577:     for tp, source, (lineno, offset), _, line in tokens:\n 578:         if tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\":\n 579:             assert_lineno = lineno\n 580:         elif assert_lineno is not None:\n 581:             # keep track of depth for the assert-message `,` lookup\n 582:             if tp == tokenize.OP and source in \"([{\":\n 583:                 depth += 1\n 584:             elif tp == tokenize.OP and source in \")]}\":\n 585:                 depth -= 1\n 586: \n 587:             if not lines:\n 588:                 lines.append(line[offset:])\n 589:                 seen_lines.add(lineno)\n 590:             # a non-nested comma separates the expression from the message\n 591:             elif depth == 0 and tp == tokenize.OP and source == \",\":\n 592:                 # one line assert with message\n 593:                 if lineno in seen_lines and len(lines) == 1:\n 594:                     offset_in_trimmed = offset + len(lines[-1]) - len(line)\n 595:                     lines[-1] = lines[-1][:offset_in_trimmed]\n 596:                 # multi-line assert with message\n 597:                 elif lineno in seen_lines:\n 598:                     lines[-1] = lines[-1][:offset]\n 599:                 # multi line assert with escapd newline before message\n 600:                 else:\n 601:                     lines.append(line[:offset])\n 602:                 _write_and_reset()\n 603:             elif tp in {tokenize.NEWLINE, tokenize.ENDMARKER}:\n 604:                 _write_and_reset()\n 605:             elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n\nNow let me continue reading the `_get_assertion_exprs` function to see how it handles line collection:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\", \"start_line\": 605, \"end_line\": 620 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nTotal lines: 1134\nShowing lines 605-620:\n\n 605:             elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n 606:                 lines.append(line)\n 607:                 seen_lines.add(lineno)\n 608: \n 609:     return ret\n 610: \n 611: \n 612: class AssertionRewriter(ast.NodeVisitor):\n 613:     \"\"\"Assertion rewriting implementation.\n 614: \n 615:     The main entrypoint is to call .run() with an ast.Module instance,\n 616:     this will then find all the assert statements and rewrite them to\n 617:     provide intermediate values and a detailed assertion error.

Looking at the `_get_assertion_exprs` function, I can see the issue:\n\n**The Problem**: In Python 3.9, when pytest encounters an assertion followed by a decorator (like `@t`), the tokenizer is incorrectly including the decorator line in the assertion expression. This happens in lines 605-607 where the function adds any new line that hasn't been seen before.\n\n**Root Cause**: The logic at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis condition adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and it's now including the decorator line `@t` as part of the token stream for the assertion, causing it to be added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Fix Needed**: The function should stop collecting lines when it encounters a decorator or other non-assertion related tokens. The current logic doesn't have a proper termination condition for when to stop collecting assertion-related lines.\n\nLet me examine how this function is called and what tokens are being processed to understand the exact flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_get_assertion_exprs\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_get_assertion_exprs' in directory (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 555-561:\n 555: \n 556: \n 557: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n 558: def _get_assertion_exprs(src: bytes) -> Dict[int, str]:\n 559:     \"\"\"Return a mapping from {lineno: \"assertion test expression\"}.\"\"\"\n 560:     ret: Dict[int, str] = {}\n 561: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 903-909:\n 903: \n 904:             #

Assertion Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Located the `_get_assertion_exprs()` function in `rewrite.py` (lines 556-609)\n  - This function is responsible for extracting assertion expressions and determining which lines to include in error messages\n  - Uses tokenization to parse source code and track assertion statements\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### Critical Function: `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n- **Purpose**: Returns a mapping from line numbers to assertion test expressions\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, lines 556-609\n- **Key Logic**:\n  - Uses `tokenize.tokenize()` to parse source code\n  - Tracks assertion statements by looking for `tokenize.NAME` tokens with value \"assert\"\n  - Maintains depth tracking for parentheses/brackets to handle multi-line assertions\n  - Collects lines in a `lines` list and tracks `seen_lines` to avoid duplicates\n  - **Critical Issue Area**: Lines 605-607 handle adding new lines when `lineno not in seen_lines`\n\n### Potential Bug Location\nThe bug likely occurs in the line collection logic (lines 605-607):\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis logic may be incorrectly including decorator lines that precede assertion statements in Python 3.9 due to changes in how Python 3.9 handles line number attribution for decorated functions.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Project structure mapped\n- Assertion handling code located\n- Key function `_get_assertion_exprs()` identified\n- Understanding of tokenization-based line extraction approach\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Detailed analysis of line number calculation logic\n- Need to understand Python 3.9-specific changes that might affect tokenization\n\n### ⏳ Next Steps Required\n1. **Create test case** to reproduce the bug with decorator + assertion scenario\n2. **Analyze tokenization behavior** differences between Python versions\n3. **Debug line collection logic** in `_get_assertion_exprs()` \n4. **Implement fix** to properly filter out decorator lines from assertion error messages\n5. **Test fix** across different Python versions\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: For project structure navigation\n- `read_file_lines`: For examining specific code sections\n- `search_code_with_context`: For finding line number-related code\n\n## Key Technical Context\nThe bug appears to be in pytest's assertion rewriting system, specifically in how it determines which source code lines to include when displaying assertion failures. The issue is likely related to Python 3.9's changes in line number attribution for decorated functions, causing pytest to incorrectly include decorator lines in assertion error output.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nLet me examine the `_get_assertion_exprs` function more closely, as this seems to be where pytest extracts assertion expressions and determines which lines to include in error messages:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\", \"start_line\": 556, \"end_line\": 620 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nTotal lines: 1134\nShowing lines 556-605:\n\n 556: \n 557: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n 558: def _get_assertion_exprs(src: bytes) -> Dict[int, str]:\n 559:     \"\"\"Return a mapping from {lineno: \"assertion test expression\"}.\"\"\"\n 560:     ret: Dict[int, str] = {}\n 561: \n 562:     depth = 0\n 563:     lines: List[str] = []\n 564:     assert_lineno: Optional[int] = None\n 565:     seen_lines: Set[int] = set()\n 566: \n 567:     def _write_and_reset() -> None:\n 568:         nonlocal depth, lines, assert_lineno, seen_lines\n 569:         assert assert_lineno is not None\n 570:         ret[assert_lineno] = \"\".join(lines).rstrip().rstrip(\"\\\\\")\n 571:         depth = 0\n 572:         lines = []\n 573:         assert_lineno = None\n 574:         seen_lines = set()\n 575: \n 576:     tokens = tokenize.tokenize(io.BytesIO(src).readline)\n 577:     for tp, source, (lineno, offset), _, line in tokens:\n 578:         if tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\":\n 579:             assert_lineno = lineno\n 580:         elif assert_lineno is not None:\n 581:             # keep track of depth for the assert-message `,` lookup\n 582:             if tp == tokenize.OP and source in \"([{\":\n 583:                 depth += 1\n 584:             elif tp == tokenize.OP and source in \")]}\":\n 585:                 depth -= 1\n 586: \n 587:             if not lines:\n 588:                 lines.append(line[offset:])\n 589:                 seen_lines.add(lineno)\n 590:             # a non-nested comma separates the expression from the message\n 591:             elif depth == 0 and tp == tokenize.OP and source == \",\":\n 592:                 # one line assert with message\n 593:                 if lineno in seen_lines and len(lines) == 1:\n 594:                     offset_in_trimmed = offset + len(lines[-1]) - len(line)\n 595:                     lines[-1] = lines[-1][:offset_in_trimmed]\n 596:                 # multi-line assert with message\n 597:                 elif lineno in seen_lines:\n 598:                     lines[-1] = lines[-1][:offset]\n 599:                 # multi line assert with escapd newline before message\n 600:                 else:\n 601:                     lines.append(line[:offset])\n 602:                 _write_and_reset()\n 603:             elif tp in {tokenize.NEWLINE, tokenize.ENDMARKER}:\n 604:                 _write_and_reset()\n 605:             elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n\nNow let me continue reading the `_get_assertion_exprs` function to see how it handles line collection:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\", \"start_line\": 605, \"end_line\": 620 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nTotal lines: 1134\nShowing lines 605-620:\n\n 605:             elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n 606:                 lines.append(line)\n 607:                 seen_lines.add(lineno)\n 608: \n 609:     return ret\n 610: \n 611: \n 612: class AssertionRewriter(ast.NodeVisitor):\n 613:     \"\"\"Assertion rewriting implementation.\n 614: \n 615:     The main entrypoint is to call .run() with an ast.Module instance,\n 616:     this will then find all the assert statements and rewrite them to\n 617:     provide intermediate values and a detailed assertion error.

Looking at the `_get_assertion_exprs` function, I can see the issue:\n\n**The Problem**: In Python 3.9, when pytest encounters an assertion followed by a decorator (like `@t`), the tokenizer is incorrectly including the decorator line in the assertion expression. This happens in lines 605-607 where the function adds any new line that hasn't been seen before.\n\n**Root Cause**: The logic at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis condition adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and it's now including the decorator line `@t` as part of the token stream for the assertion, causing it to be added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Fix Needed**: The function should stop collecting lines when it encounters a decorator or other non-assertion related tokens. The current logic doesn't have a proper termination condition for when to stop collecting assertion-related lines.\n\nLet me examine how this function is called and what tokens are being processed to understand the exact flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_get_assertion_exprs\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_get_assertion_exprs' in directory (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 555-561:\n 555: \n 556: \n 557: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n 558: def _get_assertion_exprs(src: bytes) -> Dict[int, str]:\n 559:     \"\"\"Return a mapping from {lineno: \"assertion test expression\"}.\"\"\"\n 560:     ret: Dict[int, str] = {}\n 561: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 903-909:\n 903: \n 904:             #

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Summary: Pytest Bug Investigation - Extra Code Lines in Assertion Error Messages (Python 3.9)\n\n## Main Objective\nInvestigating and fixing a bug in pytest where assertion error messages incorrectly include extra code lines (specifically decorator lines like `@t`) when running on Python 3.9. The issue appears to be related to how pytest calculates and extracts line numbers for assertion error reporting.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: \n  - Located pytest source code in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/`\n  - Identified assertion handling code in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/`\n  - Found key files: `rewrite.py`, `util.py`, `truncate.py`, `__init__.py`\n\n### 2. Assertion Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Located the `_get_assertion_exprs()` function in `rewrite.py` (lines 556-609)\n  - This function is responsible for extracting assertion expressions and determining which lines to include in error messages\n  - Uses tokenization to parse source code and track assertion statements\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### Critical Function: `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n- **Purpose**: Returns a mapping from line numbers to assertion test expressions\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, lines 556-609\n- **Key Logic**:\n  - Uses `tokenize.tokenize()` to parse source code\n  - Tracks assertion statements by looking for `tokenize.NAME` tokens with value \"assert\"\n  - Maintains depth tracking for parentheses/brackets to handle multi-line assertions\n  - Collects lines in a `lines` list and tracks `seen_lines` to avoid duplicates\n  - **Critical Issue Area**: Lines 605-607 handle adding new lines when `lineno not in seen_lines`\n\n### Potential Bug Location\nThe bug likely occurs in the line collection logic (lines 605-607):\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis logic may be incorrectly including decorator lines that precede assertion statements in Python 3.9 due to changes in how Python 3.9 handles line number attribution for decorated functions.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Project structure mapped\n- Assertion handling code located\n- Key function `_get_assertion_exprs()` identified\n- Understanding of tokenization-based line extraction approach\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Detailed analysis of line number calculation logic\n- Need to understand Python 3.9-specific changes that might affect tokenization\n\n### ⏳ Next Steps Required\n1. **Create test case** to reproduce the bug with decorator + assertion scenario\n2. **Analyze tokenization behavior** differences between Python versions\n3. **Debug line collection logic** in `_get_assertion_exprs()` \n4. **Implement fix** to properly filter out decorator lines from assertion error messages\n5. **Test fix** across different Python versions\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: For project structure navigation\n- `read_file_lines`: For examining specific code sections\n- `search_code_with_context`: For finding line number-related code\n\n## Key Technical Context\nThe bug appears to be in pytest's assertion rewriting system, specifically in how it determines which source code lines to include when displaying assertion failures. The issue is likely related to Python 3.9's changes in line number attribution for decorated functions, causing pytest to incorrectly include decorator lines in assertion error output.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nLet me examine the `_get_assertion_exprs` function more closely, as this seems to be where pytest extracts assertion expressions and determines which lines to include in error messages:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\", \"start_line\": 556, \"end_line\": 620 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nTotal lines: 1134\nShowing lines 556-605:\n\n 556: \n 557: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n 558: def _get_assertion_exprs(src: bytes) -> Dict[int, str]:\n 559:     \"\"\"Return a mapping from {lineno: \"assertion test expression\"}.\"\"\"\n 560:     ret: Dict[int, str] = {}\n 561: \n 562:     depth = 0\n 563:     lines: List[str] = []\n 564:     assert_lineno: Optional[int] = None\n 565:     seen_lines: Set[int] = set()\n 566: \n 567:     def _write_and_reset() -> None:\n 568:         nonlocal depth, lines, assert_lineno, seen_lines\n 569:         assert assert_lineno is not None\n 570:         ret[assert_lineno] = \"\".join(lines).rstrip().rstrip(\"\\\\\")\n 571:         depth = 0\n 572:         lines = []\n 573:         assert_lineno = None\n 574:         seen_lines = set()\n 575: \n 576:     tokens = tokenize.tokenize(io.BytesIO(src).readline)\n 577:     for tp, source, (lineno, offset), _, line in tokens:\n 578:         if tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\":\n 579:             assert_lineno = lineno\n 580:         elif assert_lineno is not None:\n 581:             # keep track of depth for the assert-message `,` lookup\n 582:             if tp == tokenize.OP and source in \"([{\":\n 583:                 depth += 1\n 584:             elif tp == tokenize.OP and source in \")]}\":\n 585:                 depth -= 1\n 586: \n 587:             if not lines:\n 588:                 lines.append(line[offset:])\n 589:                 seen_lines.add(lineno)\n 590:             # a non-nested comma separates the expression from the message\n 591:             elif depth == 0 and tp == tokenize.OP and source == \",\":\n 592:                 # one line assert with message\n 593:                 if lineno in seen_lines and len(lines) == 1:\n 594:                     offset_in_trimmed = offset + len(lines[-1]) - len(line)\n 595:                     lines[-1] = lines[-1][:offset_in_trimmed]\n 596:                 # multi-line assert with message\n 597:                 elif lineno in seen_lines:\n 598:                     lines[-1] = lines[-1][:offset]\n 599:                 # multi line assert with escapd newline before message\n 600:                 else:\n 601:                     lines.append(line[:offset])\n 602:                 _write_and_reset()\n 603:             elif tp in {tokenize.NEWLINE, tokenize.ENDMARKER}:\n 604:                 _write_and_reset()\n 605:             elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n\nNow let me continue reading the `_get_assertion_exprs` function to see how it handles line collection:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\", \"start_line\": 605, \"end_line\": 620 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nTotal lines: 1134\nShowing lines 605-620:\n\n 605:             elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n 606:                 lines.append(line)\n 607:                 seen_lines.add(lineno)\n 608: \n 609:     return ret\n 610: \n 611: \n 612: class AssertionRewriter(ast.NodeVisitor):\n 613:     \"\"\"Assertion rewriting implementation.\n 614: \n 615:     The main entrypoint is to call .run() with an ast.Module instance,\n 616:     this will then find all the assert statements and rewrite them to\n 617:     provide intermediate values and a detailed assertion error.

Looking at the `_get_assertion_exprs` function, I can see the issue:\n\n**The Problem**: In Python 3.9, when pytest encounters an assertion followed by a decorator (like `@t`), the tokenizer is incorrectly including the decorator line in the assertion expression. This happens in lines 605-607 where the function adds any new line that hasn't been seen before.\n\n**Root Cause**: The logic at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis condition adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and it's now including the decorator line `@t` as part of the token stream for the assertion, causing it to be added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Fix Needed**: The function should stop collecting lines when it encounters a decorator or other non-assertion related tokens. The current logic doesn't have a proper termination condition for when to stop collecting assertion-related lines.\n\nLet me examine how this function is called and what tokens are being processed to understand the exact flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_get_assertion_exprs\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_get_assertion_exprs' in directory (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 555-561:\n 555: \n 556: \n 557: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n 558: def _get_assertion_exprs(src: bytes) -> Dict[int, str]:\n 559:     \"\"\"Return a mapping from {lineno: \"assertion test expression\"}.\"\"\"\n 560:     ret: Dict[int, str] = {}\n 561: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 903-909:\n 903: \n 904:             #

    "response": "Based on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I have identified the root cause of the bug and the specific locations that need to be fixed.\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\nThe issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. This function extracts assertion expressions from source code using tokenization, but it has a flaw in its line collection logic that manifests in Python 3.9.\n\n**Root Cause**: The condition at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis logic adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and when it encounters a decorator like `@t` after an assertion, it includes that decorator line as part of the token stream, causing it to be incorrectly added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Problem Flow**:\n1. Tokenizer encounters `assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)` \n2. Sets `assert_lineno` and starts collecting lines\n3. In Python 3.9, tokenizer continues and encounters the `@t` decorator on the next line\n4. The condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` is true\n5. The decorator line `@t` gets added to the assertion expression\n6. When the assertion fails, pytest displays both the assertion and the decorator line\n\n## Locations to Fix\n\n**Location 1: Lines 605-607** - Primary bug location\nThe overly permissive line collection logic that incorrectly includes decorator lines.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 578-579** - Related logic\nThe assertion detection logic that starts the line collection process.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 587-589** - Related logic  \nThe initial line collection logic that starts gathering assertion lines.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 603-604** - Related logic\nThe termination conditions that should properly end line collection.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 567-574** - Related logic\nThe `_write_and_reset` function that finalizes the collected assertion expression.\n\nThe fix should add proper termination conditions to stop collecting lines when encountering decorators or other non-assertion tokens, specifically targeting the logic at lines 605-607 to be more restrictive about what constitutes a valid continuation of an assertion expression.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**",

The issue appears to be related to how pytest calculates and extracts line numbers for assertion error reporting.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: \n  - Located pytest source code in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/`\n  - Identified assertion handling code in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/`\n  - Found key files: `rewrite.py`, `util.py`, `truncate.py`, `__init__.py`\n\n### 2. Assertion Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Located the `_get_assertion_exprs()` function in `rewrite.py` (lines 556-609)\n  - This function is responsible for extracting assertion expressions and determining which lines to include in error messages\n  - Uses tokenization to parse source code and track assertion statements\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### Critical Function: `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n- **Purpose**: Returns a mapping from line numbers to assertion test expressions\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, lines 556-609\n- **Key Logic**:\n  - Uses `tokenize.tokenize()` to parse source code\n  - Tracks assertion statements by looking for `tokenize.NAME` tokens with value \"assert\"\n  - Maintains depth tracking for parentheses/brackets to handle multi-line assertions\n  - Collects lines in a `lines` list and tracks `seen_lines` to avoid duplicates\n  - **Critical Issue Area**: Lines 605-607 handle adding new lines when `lineno not in seen_lines`\n\n### Potential Bug Location\nThe bug likely occurs in the line collection logic (lines 605-607):\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis logic may be incorrectly including decorator lines that precede assertion statements in Python 3.9 due to changes in how Python 3.9 handles line number attribution for decorated functions.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Project structure mapped\n- Assertion handling code located\n- Key function `_get_assertion_exprs()` identified\n- Understanding of tokenization-based line extraction approach\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Detailed analysis of line number calculation logic\n- Need to understand Python 3.9-specific changes that might affect tokenization\n\n### ⏳ Next Steps Required\n1. **Create test case** to reproduce the bug with decorator + assertion scenario\n2. **Analyze tokenization behavior** differences between Python versions\n3. **Debug line collection logic** in `_get_assertion_exprs()` \n4. **Implement fix** to properly filter out decorator lines from assertion error messages\n5. **Test fix** across different Python versions\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: For project structure navigation\n- `read_file_lines`: For examining specific code sections\n- `search_code_with_context`: For finding line number-related code\n\n## Key Technical Context\nThe bug appears to be in pytest's assertion rewriting system, specifically in how it determines which source code lines to include when displaying assertion failures. The issue is likely related to Python 3.9's changes in line number attribution for decorated functions, causing pytest to incorrectly include decorator lines in assertion error output.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: Let me examine the `_get_assertion_exprs` function more closely, as this seems to be where pytest extracts assertion expressions and determines which lines to include in error messages:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\", \"start_line\": 556, \"end_line\": 620 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nTotal lines: 1134\nShowing lines 556-605:\n\n 556: \n 557: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n 558: def _get_assertion_exprs(src: bytes) -> Dict[int, str]:\n 559:     \"\"\"Return a mapping from {lineno: \"assertion test expression\"}.\"\"\"\n 560:     ret: Dict[int, str] = {}\n 561: \n 562:     depth = 0\n 563:     lines: List[str] = []\n 564:     assert_lineno: Optional[int] = None\n 565:     seen_lines: Set[int] = set()\n 566: \n 567:     def _write_and_reset() -> None:\n 568:         nonlocal depth, lines, assert_lineno, seen_lines\n 569:         assert assert_lineno is not None\n 570:         ret[assert_lineno] = \"\".join(lines).rstrip().rstrip(\"\\\\\")\n 571:         depth = 0\n 572:         lines = []\n 573:         assert_lineno = None\n 574:         seen_lines = set()\n 575: \n 576:     tokens = tokenize.tokenize(io.BytesIO(src).readline)\n 577:     for tp, source, (lineno, offset), _, line in tokens:\n 578:         if tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\":\n 579:             assert_lineno = lineno\n 580:         elif assert_lineno is not None:\n 581:             # keep track of depth for the assert-message `,` lookup\n 582:             if tp == tokenize.OP and source in \"([{\":\n 583:                 depth += 1\n 584:             elif tp == tokenize.OP and source in \")]}\":\n 585:                 depth -= 1\n 586: \n 587:             if not lines:\n 588:                 lines.append(line[offset:])\n 589:                 seen_lines.add(lineno)\n 590:             # a non-nested comma separates the expression from the message\n 591:             elif depth == 0 and tp == tokenize.OP and source == \",\":\n 592:                 # one line assert with message\n 593:                 if lineno in seen_lines and len(lines) == 1:\n 594:                     offset_in_trimmed = offset + len(lines[-1]) - len(line)\n 595:                     lines[-1] = lines[-1][:offset_in_trimmed]\n 596:                 # multi-line assert with message\n 597:                 elif lineno in seen_lines:\n 598:                     lines[-1] = lines[-1][:offset]\n 599:                 # multi line assert with escapd newline before message\n 600:                 else:\n 601:                     lines.append(line[:offset])\n 602:                 _write_and_reset()\n 603:             elif tp in {tokenize.NEWLINE, tokenize.ENDMARKER}:\n 604:                 _write_and_reset()\n 605:             elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n\n\nAssistant: Now let me continue reading the `_get_assertion_exprs` function to see how it handles line collection:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\", \"start_line\": 605, \"end_line\": 620 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nTotal lines: 1134\nShowing lines 605-620:\n\n 605:             elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n 606:                 lines.append(line)\n 607:                 seen_lines.add(lineno)\n 608: \n 609:     return ret\n 610: \n 611: \n 612: class AssertionRewriter(ast.NodeVisitor):\n 613:     \"\"\"Assertion rewriting implementation.\n 614: \n 615:     The main entrypoint is to call .run() with an ast.Module instance,\n 616:     this will then find all the assert statements and rewrite them to\n 617:     provide intermediate values and a detailed assertion error.

Looking at the `_get_assertion_exprs` function, I can see the issue:\n\n**The Problem**: In Python 3.9, when pytest encounters an assertion followed by a decorator (like `@t`), the tokenizer is incorrectly including the decorator line in the assertion expression. This happens in lines 605-607 where the function adds any new line that hasn't been seen before.\n\n**Root Cause**: The logic at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis condition adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and it's now including the decorator line `@t` as part of the token stream for the assertion, causing it to be added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Fix Needed**: The function should stop collecting lines when it encounters a decorator or other non-assertion related tokens. The current logic doesn't have a proper termination condition for when to stop collecting assertion-related lines.\n\nLet me examine how this function is called and what tokens are being processed to understand the exact flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_get_assertion_exprs\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_get_assertion_exprs' in directory (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 555-561:\n 555: \n 556: \n 557: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n 558: def _get_assertion_exprs(src: bytes) -> Dict[int, str]:\n 559:     \"\"\"Return a mapping from {lineno: \"assertion test expression\"}.\"\"\"\n 560:     ret: Dict[int, str] = {}\n 561: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 903-909:\n 903: \n 904:             #

Let me examine the tokenization behavior more closely to understand exactly what's happening.

This function extracts assertion expressions from source code using tokenization, but it has a flaw in its line collection logic that manifests in Python 3.9.\n\n**Root Cause**: The condition at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis logic adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and when it encounters a decorator like `@t` after an assertion, it includes that decorator line as part of the token stream, causing it to be incorrectly added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Problem Flow**:\n1. Tokenizer encounters `assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)` \n2. Sets `assert_lineno` and starts collecting lines\n3. In Python 3.9, tokenizer continues and encounters the `@t` decorator on the next line\n4. The condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` is true\n5. The decorator line `@t` gets added to the assertion expression\n6. When the assertion fails, pytest displays both the assertion and the decorator line\n\n## Locations to Fix\n\n**Location 1: Lines 605-607** - Primary bug location\nThe overly permissive line collection logic that incorrectly includes decorator lines.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 578-579** - Related logic\nThe assertion detection logic that starts the line collection process.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 587-589** - Related logic  \nThe initial line collection logic that starts gathering assertion lines.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 603-604** - Related logic\nThe termination conditions that should properly end line collection.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 567-574** - Related logic\nThe `_write_and_reset` function that finalizes the collected assertion expression.\n\nThe fix should add proper termination conditions to stop collecting lines when encountering decorators or other non-assertion tokens, specifically targeting the logic at lines 605-607 to be more restrictive about what constitutes a valid continuation of an assertion expression.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that:\n1.

The issue appears to be related to how pytest calculates and extracts line numbers for assertion error reporting.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: \n  - Located pytest source code in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/`\n  - Identified assertion handling code in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/`\n  - Found key files: `rewrite.py`, `util.py`, `truncate.py`, `__init__.py`\n\n### 2. Assertion Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Located the `_get_assertion_exprs()` function in `rewrite.py` (lines 556-609)\n  - This function is responsible for extracting assertion expressions and determining which lines to include in error messages\n  - Uses tokenization to parse source code and track assertion statements\n\n### 3. Deep Code Analysis and Bug Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` (lines 556-620, 605-620)\n- **Critical Discovery**: Found the exact bug location and root cause\n- **Analysis Results**:\n  - Examined complete `_get_assertion_exprs()` function implementation\n  - Traced assertion expression formatting flow through `format_explanation` in `util.py`\n  - Identified how assertion expressions are used in error message generation\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### Critical Function: `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n- **Purpose**: Returns a mapping from line numbers to assertion test expressions\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, lines 556-609\n- **Key Logic**:\n  - Uses `tokenize.tokenize()` to parse source code\n  - Tracks assertion statements by looking for `tokenize.NAME` tokens with value \"assert\"\n  - Maintains depth tracking for parentheses/brackets to handle multi-line assertions\n  - Collects lines in a `lines` list and tracks `seen_lines` to avoid duplicates\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Overly Permissive Line Collection Logic\n\n**The Bug Location**: Lines 605-607 in `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\n**Problem Analysis**:\n- This condition adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before\n- In Python 3.9, tokenizer behavior changed and now includes decorator lines like `@t` in the token stream after assertions\n- The logic lacks proper termination conditions to stop collecting assertion-related lines\n- When encountering a decorator after an assertion, it incorrectly includes the decorator line in the assertion expression\n\n**Bug Flow in Python 3.9**:\n1. Tokenizer encounters `assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)`\n2. Sets `assert_lineno` and starts collecting lines  \n3. Tokenizer continues and encounters `@t` decorator on next line\n4. Condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` evaluates to true\n5. Decorator line `@t` gets added to assertion expression\n6. Assertion failure displays both assertion and decorator line incorrectly\n\n## **PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\n### Primary Bug Locations Identified:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 605-607** - **PRIMARY BUG LOCATION**\n- The overly permissive line collection logic that incorrectly includes decorator lines\n- **Fix Required**: Add proper termination conditions to stop collecting lines when encountering decorators or other non-assertion tokens\n\n**Location 2: Lines 578-579** - Related logic\n- The assertion detection logic that starts the line collection process\n\n**Location 3: Lines 587-589** - Related logic  \n- The initial line collection logic that starts gathering assertion lines\n\n**Location 4: Lines 603-604** - Related logic\n- The termination conditions that should properly end line collection\n\n**Location 5: Lines 567-574** - Related logic\n- The `_write_and_reset` function that finalizes the collected assertion expression\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Project structure mapped\n- Assertion handling code located\n- Key function `_get_assertion_exprs()` identified and fully analyzed\n- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Overly permissive line collection logic at lines 605-607\n- **BUG LOCATIONS PINPOINTED**: Specific lines requiring fixes identified\n- Understanding of tokenization-based line extraction approach\n- Traced assertion expression formatting flow through util.py\n- Analyzed Python 3.9-specific tokenization behavior changes\n\n### 🔄 Ready for Implementation\n- **Exact fix location identified**: Lines 605-607 in `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n- **Fix strategy determined**: Add proper termination conditions for line collection\n- **Impact assessment complete**: Changes needed in tokenization logic\n\n### ⏳ Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement fix** to add proper termination conditions in lines 605-607\n2. **Create test case** to reproduce the bug with decorator + assertion scenario  \n3. **Test fix** across different Python versions to ensure compatibility\n4. **Validate fix** doesn't break existing assertion error formatting\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: For project structure navigation\n- `read_file_lines`: For examining specific code sections (556-620, 605-620)\n- `search_code_with_context`: For finding assertion-related code patterns\n\n## Key Technical Context\nThe bug is definitively located in pytest's assertion rewriting system, specifically in the `_get_assertion_exprs()` function's line collection logic.

The issue is caused by Python 3.9's changes in tokenization behavior for decorated functions, causing pytest to incorrectly include decorator lines in assertion error output due to overly permissive line collection conditions at lines 605-607.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug. Let me examine the tokenization behavior more closely to understand exactly what's happening. The issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function where it's incorrectly including decorator lines in Python 3.9.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"tokenize.NAME\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'tokenize.NAME' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 575-581:\n 575: \n 576:     tokens = tokenize.tokenize(io.BytesIO(src).readline)\n 577:     for tp, source, (lineno, offset), _, line in tokens:\n 578:         if tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\":\n 579:             assert_lineno = lineno\n 580:         elif assert_lineno is not None:\n 581:             # keep track of depth for the assert-message `,` lookup\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nBased on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I have identified the root cause of the bug and the specific locations that need to be fixed.\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\nThe issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. This function extracts assertion expressions from source code using tokenization, but it has a flaw in its line collection logic that manifests in Python 3.9.\n\n**Root Cause**: The condition at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis logic adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and when it encounters a decorator like `@t` after an assertion, it includes that decorator line as part of the token stream, causing it to be incorrectly added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Problem Flow**:\n1. Tokenizer encounters `assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)` \n2. Sets `assert_lineno` and starts collecting lines\n3. In Python 3.9, tokenizer continues and encounters the `@t` decorator on the next line\n4. The condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` is true\n5. The decorator line `@t` gets added to the assertion expression\n6. When the assertion fails, pytest displays both the assertion and the decorator line\n\n## Locations to Fix\n\n**Location 1: Lines 605-607** - Primary bug location\nThe overly permissive line collection logic that incorrectly includes decorator lines.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 578-579** - Related logic\nThe assertion detection logic that starts the line collection process.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 587-589** - Related logic  \nThe initial line collection logic that starts gathering assertion lines.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 603-604** - Related logic\nThe termination conditions that should properly end line collection.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 567-574** - Related logic\nThe `_write_and_reset` function that finalizes the collected assertion expression.\n\nThe fix should add proper termination conditions to stop collecting lines when encountering decorators or other non-assertion tokens, specifically targeting the logic at lines 605-607 to be more restrictive about what constitutes a valid continuation of an assertion expression.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nError message prints extra code line when using assert in python3.9\n<!--\r\nThanks for submitting an issue!\r\n\r\nQuick check-list while reporting bugs:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] a detailed description of the bug or problem you are having\r\n- [x] output of `pip list` from the virtual environment you are using\r\n- [x] pytest and operating system versions\r\n- [ ] minimal example if possible\r\n### Description\r\nI have a test like this:\r\n```\r\nfrom pytest import fixture\r\n\r\n\r\ndef t(foo):\r\n    return foo\r\n\r\n\r\n@fixture\r\ndef foo():\r\n    return 1\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_right_statement(foo):\r\n    assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)\r\n\r\n    @t\r\n    def inner():\r\n        return 2\r\n\r\n    assert 2 == inner\r\n\r\n\r\n@t\r\ndef outer():\r\n    return 2\r\n```\r\nThe test \"test_right_statement\" fails at the first assertion,but print extra code (the \"t\" decorator) in error details, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n ============================= test session starts =============================\r\nplatform win32 -- Python 3.9.6, pytest-6.2.5, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 -- \r\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\r\nrootdir: \r\nplugins: allure-pytest-2.9.45\r\ncollecting ... collected 1 item\r\n\r\ntest_statement.py::test_right_statement FAILED                           [100%]\r\n\r\n================================== FAILURES ===================================\r\n____________________________ test_right_statement _____________________________\r\n\r\nfoo = 1\r\n\r\n    def test_right_statement(foo):\r\n>       assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)\r\n    \r\n        @t\r\nE       assert 1 == 75\r\nE         +1\r\nE         -75\r\n\r\ntest_statement.py:14: AssertionError\r\n=========================== short test summary info ===========================\r\nFAILED test_statement.py::test_right_statement -

Let me examine the tokenization behavior more closely to understand exactly what's happening. The issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function where it's incorrectly including decorator lines in Python 3.9.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"tokenize.NAME\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'tokenize.NAME' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nLines 575-581:\n 575: \n 576:     tokens = tokenize.tokenize(io.BytesIO(src).readline)\n 577:     for tp, source, (lineno, offset), _, line in tokens:\n 578:         if tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\":\n 579:             assert_lineno = lineno\n 580:         elif assert_lineno is not None:\n 581:             # keep track of depth for the assert-message `,` lookup\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nBased on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I have identified the root cause of the bug and the specific locations that need to be fixed.\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\nThe issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. This function extracts assertion expressions from source code using tokenization, but it has a flaw in its line collection logic that manifests in Python 3.9.\n\n**Root Cause**: The condition at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis logic adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and when it encounters a decorator like `@t` after an assertion, it includes that decorator line as part of the token stream, causing it to be incorrectly added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Problem Flow**:\n1. Tokenizer encounters `assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)` \n2. Sets `assert_lineno` and starts collecting lines\n3. In Python 3.9, tokenizer continues and encounters the `@t` decorator on the next line\n4. The condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` is true\n5. The decorator line `@t` gets added to the assertion expression\n6. When the assertion fails, pytest displays both the assertion and the decorator line\n\n## Locations to Fix\n\n**Location 1: Lines 605-607** - Primary bug location\nThe overly permissive line collection logic that incorrectly includes decorator lines.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 578-579** - Related logic\nThe assertion detection logic that starts the line collection process.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 587-589** - Related logic  \nThe initial line collection logic that starts gathering assertion lines.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 603-604** - Related logic\nThe termination conditions that should properly end line collection.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 567-574** - Related logic\nThe `_write_and_reset` function that finalizes the collected assertion expression.\n\nThe fix should add proper termination conditions to stop collecting lines when encountering decorators or other non-assertion tokens, specifically targeting the logic at lines 605-607 to be more restrictive about what constitutes a valid continuation of an assertion expression.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where pytest incorrectly includes extra code lines (specifically decorator lines like `@t`) in assertion error messages when running on Python 3.9, I have identified the root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function in the assertion rewriting module. The function uses tokenization to extract assertion expressions, but has overly permissive line collection logic that incorrectly includes decorator lines in Python 3.9 due to changes in tokenizer behavior.\n\nThe primary bug is at lines 605-607 where the condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts, without proper validation that the line is actually part of the assertion expression.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 605,\n            \"end_line\": 607\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 578,\n            \"end_line\": 579\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 587,\n            \"end_line\": 589\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 603,\n            \"end_line\": 604\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 567,\n            \"end_line\": 574\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe problem statement the project is:\nError message prints extra code line when using assert in python3.9\n<!--\r\nThanks for submitting an issue!\r\n\r\nQuick check-list while reporting bugs:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] a detailed description of the bug or problem you are having\r\n- [x] output of `pip list` from the virtual environment you are using\r\n- [x] pytest and operating system versions\r\n- [ ] minimal example if possible\r\n### Description\r\nI have a test like this:\r\n```\r\nfrom pytest import fixture\r\n\r\n\r\ndef t(foo):\r\n    return foo\r\n\r\n\r\n@fixture\r\ndef foo():\r\n    return 1\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_right_statement(foo):\r\n    assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)\r\n\r\n    @t\r\n    def inner():\r\n        return 2\r\n\r\n    assert 2 == inner\r\n\r\n\r\n@t\r\ndef outer():\r\n    return 2\r\n```\r\nThe test \"test_right_statement\" fails at the first assertion,but print extra code (the \"t\" decorator) in error details, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n ============================= test session starts =============================\r\nplatform win32 -- Python 3.9.6, pytest-6.2.5, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 -- \r\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\r\nrootdir: \r\nplugins: allure-pytest-2.9.45\r\ncollecting ... collected 1 item\r\n\r\ntest_statement.py::test_right_statement FAILED                           [100%]\r\n\r\n================================== FAILURES ===================================\r\n____________________________ test_right_statement _____________________________\r\n\r\nfoo = 1\r\n\r\n    def test_right_statement(foo):\r\n>       assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)\r\n    \r\n        @t\r\nE       assert 1 == 75\r\nE         +1\r\nE         -75\r\n\r\ntest_statement.py:14: AssertionError\r\n=========================== short test summary info ===========================\r\nFAILED test_statement.py::test_right_statement -

Add validation that the line being collected is syntactically related to the assertion statement and not a separate code construct.\n\n4. **[Lines 603-604] - Termination Conditions**: Enhance the existing termination conditions to properly handle Python 3.9's tokenizer behavior.

Add a final filter to remove any lines that don't belong to the assertion (like decorator lines that may have been incorrectly collected) before writing the expression to the result mapping.\n\nThese coordinated changes will ensure that assertion expressions are properly bounded and don't include extraneous code lines like decorators, specifically addressing the Python 3.9 tokenizer behavior changes while maintaining compatibility with earlier Python versions.",

The issue appears to be related to how pytest calculates and extracts line numbers for assertion error reporting.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: \n  - Located pytest source code in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/`\n  - Identified assertion handling code in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/`\n  - Found key files: `rewrite.py`, `util.py`, `truncate.py`, `__init__.py`\n\n### 2. Assertion Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Located the `_get_assertion_exprs()` function in `rewrite.py` (lines 556-609)\n  - This function is responsible for extracting assertion expressions and determining which lines to include in error messages\n  - Uses tokenization to parse source code and track assertion statements\n\n### 3. Deep Code Analysis and Bug Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` (lines 556-620, 605-620)\n- **Critical Discovery**: Found the exact bug location and root cause\n- **Analysis Results**:\n  - Examined complete `_get_assertion_exprs()` function implementation\n  - Traced assertion expression formatting flow through `format_explanation` in `util.py`\n  - Identified how assertion expressions are used in error message generation\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### Critical Function: `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n- **Purpose**: Returns a mapping from line numbers to assertion test expressions\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, lines 556-609\n- **Key Logic**:\n  - Uses `tokenize.tokenize()` to parse source code\n  - Tracks assertion statements by looking for `tokenize.NAME` tokens with value \"assert\"\n  - Maintains depth tracking for parentheses/brackets to handle multi-line assertions\n  - Collects lines in a `lines` list and tracks `seen_lines` to avoid duplicates\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Overly Permissive Line Collection Logic\n\n**The Bug Location**: Lines 605-607 in `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\n**Problem Analysis**:\n- This condition adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before\n- In Python 3.9, tokenizer behavior changed and now includes decorator lines like `@t` in the token stream after assertions\n- The logic lacks proper termination conditions to stop collecting assertion-related lines\n- When encountering a decorator after an assertion, it incorrectly includes the decorator line in the assertion expression\n\n**Bug Flow in Python 3.9**:\n1. Tokenizer encounters `assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)`\n2. Sets `assert_lineno` and starts collecting lines  \n3. Tokenizer continues and encounters `@t` decorator on next line\n4. Condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` evaluates to true\n5. Decorator line `@t` gets added to assertion expression\n6. Assertion failure displays both assertion and decorator line incorrectly\n\n## **PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\n### Primary Bug Locations Identified:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 605-607** - **PRIMARY BUG LOCATION**\n- The overly permissive line collection logic that incorrectly includes decorator lines\n- **Fix Required**: Add proper termination conditions to stop collecting lines when encountering decorators or other non-assertion tokens\n\n**Location 2: Lines 578-579** - Related logic\n- The assertion detection logic that starts the line collection process\n\n**Location 3: Lines 587-589** - Related logic  \n- The initial line collection logic that starts gathering assertion lines\n\n**Location 4: Lines 603-604** - Related logic\n- The termination conditions that should properly end line collection\n\n**Location 5: Lines 567-574** - Related logic\n- The `_write_and_reset` function that finalizes the collected assertion expression\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Project structure mapped\n- Assertion handling code located\n- Key function `_get_assertion_exprs()` identified and fully analyzed\n- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Overly permissive line collection logic at lines 605-607\n- **BUG LOCATIONS PINPOINTED**: Specific lines requiring fixes identified\n- Understanding of tokenization-based line extraction approach\n- Traced assertion expression formatting flow through util.py\n- Analyzed Python 3.9-specific tokenization behavior changes\n\n### 🔄 Ready for Implementation\n- **Exact fix location identified**: Lines 605-607 in `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n- **Fix strategy determined**: Add proper termination conditions for line collection\n- **Impact assessment complete**: Changes needed in tokenization logic\n\n### ⏳ Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement fix** to add proper termination conditions in lines 605-607\n2. **Create test case** to reproduce the bug with decorator + assertion scenario  \n3. **Test fix** across different Python versions to ensure compatibility\n4. **Validate fix** doesn't break existing assertion error formatting\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: For project structure navigation\n- `read_file_lines`: For examining specific code sections (556-620, 605-620)\n- `search_code_with_context`: For finding assertion-related code patterns\n\n## Key Technical Context\nThe bug is definitively located in pytest's assertion rewriting system, specifically in the `_get_assertion_exprs()` function's line collection logic.

This function extracts assertion expressions from source code using tokenization, but it has a flaw in its line collection logic that manifests in Python 3.9.\n\n**Root Cause**: The condition at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis logic adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and when it encounters a decorator like `@t` after an assertion, it includes that decorator line as part of the token stream, causing it to be incorrectly added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Problem Flow**:\n1. Tokenizer encounters `assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)` \n2. Sets `assert_lineno` and starts collecting lines\n3. In Python 3.9, tokenizer continues and encounters the `@t` decorator on the next line\n4. The condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` is true\n5. The decorator line `@t` gets added to the assertion expression\n6. When the assertion fails, pytest displays both the assertion and the decorator line\n\n## Locations to Fix\n\n**Location 1: Lines 605-607** - Primary bug location\nThe overly permissive line collection logic that incorrectly includes decorator lines.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 578-579** - Related logic\nThe assertion detection logic that starts the line collection process.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 587-589** - Related logic  \nThe initial line collection logic that starts gathering assertion lines.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 603-604** - Related logic\nThe termination conditions that should properly end line collection.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 567-574** - Related logic\nThe `_write_and_reset` function that finalizes the collected assertion expression.\n\nThe fix should add proper termination conditions to stop collecting lines when encountering decorators or other non-assertion tokens, specifically targeting the logic at lines 605-607 to be more restrictive about what constitutes a valid continuation of an assertion expression.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where pytest incorrectly includes extra code lines (specifically decorator lines like `@t`) in assertion error messages when running on Python 3.9, I have identified the root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function in the assertion rewriting module. The function uses tokenization to extract assertion expressions, but has overly permissive line collection logic that incorrectly includes decorator lines in Python 3.9 due to changes in tokenizer behavior.\n\nThe primary bug is at lines 605-607 where the condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts, without proper validation that the line is actually part of the assertion expression.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 605,\n            \"end_line\": 607\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 578,\n            \"end_line\": 579\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 587,\n            \"end_line\": 589\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 603,\n            \"end_line\": 604\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 567,\n            \"end_line\": 574\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete problem statement. The bug is exactly as I analyzed - in Python 3.9, pytest's assertion error messages incorrectly include extra code lines (specifically the `@t` decorator line) that should not be part of the assertion expression display.\n\nThe user provided a clear test case showing:\n1. In Python 3.9: The assertion error incorrectly shows both the assertion line AND the `@t` decorator line\n2. In Python 3.7: The assertion error correctly shows only the assertion line\n\nThis confirms my analysis that the issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function where the line collection logic is too permissive in Python 3.9 due to tokenizer behavior changes.\n\nI'm ready to propose specific repair suggestions for each of the identified bug locations.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **[Lines 605-607] - Primary Fix**: Replace the overly permissive line collection condition with proper validation logic. The current `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` should be enhanced to check if the token is actually part of the assertion expression. Add validation to ensure we only collect lines that contain assertion-related tokens (operators, operands, parentheses, etc.) and stop collection when encountering decorators (`@` symbol) or function definitions (`def` keyword).\n\n2. **[Lines 578-579] - Assertion Detection Enhancement**: Enhance the assertion detection logic to better track the scope of assertion expressions. When `tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\"` is detected, initialize additional state variables to track the expected end of the assertion (e.g., when we encounter a newline followed by non-continuation tokens).\n\n3. **[Lines 587-589] - Initial Line Collection Logic**: Strengthen the initial line collection logic to establish clearer boundaries for what constitutes the assertion expression. Add validation that the line being collected is syntactically related to the assertion statement and not a separate code construct.\n\n4. **[Lines 603-604] - Termination Conditions**: Enhance the existing termination conditions to properly handle Python 3.9's tokenizer behavior. Add specific checks for decorator tokens (`@` symbol) and function definition keywords (`def`) that should immediately terminate assertion line collection, preventing decorator lines from being included in assertion expressions.\n\n5. **[Lines 567-574] - Write and Reset Function**: Modify the `_write_and_reset` function to include additional validation before finalizing the collected assertion expression. Add a final filter to remove any lines that don't belong to the assertion (like decorator lines that may have been incorrectly collected) before writing the expression to the result mapping.\n\nThese coordinated changes will ensure that assertion expressions are properly bounded and don't include extraneous code lines like decorators, specifically addressing the Python 3.9 tokenizer behavior changes while maintaining compatibility with earlier Python versions.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py lines 605-607\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n                lines.append(line)\n                seen_lines.add(lineno)\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py lines 578-579\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        if tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\":\n            assert_lineno = lineno\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py lines 587-589\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if not lines:\n                lines.append(line[offset:])\n                seen_lines.add(lineno)\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py lines 603-604\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            elif tp in {tokenize.NEWLINE, tokenize.ENDMARKER}:\n                _write_and_reset()\n\n\n[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py lines 567-574\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def _write_and_reset() -> None:\n        nonlocal depth, lines, assert_lineno, seen_lines\n        assert assert_lineno is not None\n        ret[assert_lineno] = \"\".join(lines).rstrip().rstrip(\"\\\\\")\n        depth = 0\n        lines = []\n        assert_lineno = None\n        seen_lines = set()\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nError message prints extra code line when using assert in python3.9\n<!--\r\nThanks for submitting an issue!\r\n\r\nQuick check-list while reporting bugs:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] a detailed description of the bug or problem you are having\r\n- [x] output of `pip list` from the virtual environment you are using\r\n- [x] pytest and operating system versions\r\n- [ ] minimal example if possible\r\n### Description\r\nI have a test like this:\r\n```\r\nfrom pytest import fixture\r\n\r\n\r\ndef t(foo):\r\n    return foo\r\n\r\n\r\n@fixture\r\ndef foo():\r\n    return 1\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_right_statement(foo):\r\n    assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)\r\n\r\n    @t\r\n    def inner():\r\n        return 2\r\n\r\n    assert 2 == inner\r\n\r\n\r\n@t\r\ndef outer():\r\n    return 2\r\n```\r\nThe test \"test_right_statement\" fails at the first assertion,but print extra code (the \"t\" decorator) in error details, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n ============================= test session starts =============================\r\nplatform win32 -- Python 3.9.6, pytest-6.2.5, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 -- \r\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\r\nrootdir: \r\nplugins: allure-pytest-2.9.45\r\ncollecting ... collected 1 item\r\n\r\ntest_statement.py::test_right_statement FAILED                           [100%]\r\n\r\n================================== FAILURES ===================================\r\n____________________________ test_right_statement _____________________________\r\n\r\nfoo = 1\r\n\r\n    def test_right_statement(foo):\r\n>       assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)\r\n    \r\n        @t\r\nE       assert 1 == 75\r\nE         +1\r\nE         -75\r\n\r\ntest_statement.py:14: AssertionError\r\n=========================== short test summary info ===========================\r\nFAILED test_statement.py::test_right_statement -

The issue appears to be related to how pytest calculates and extracts line numbers for assertion error reporting.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: \n  - Located pytest source code in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/`\n  - Identified assertion handling code in `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/`\n  - Found key files: `rewrite.py`, `util.py`, `truncate.py`, `__init__.py`\n\n### 2. Assertion Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Located the `_get_assertion_exprs()` function in `rewrite.py` (lines 556-609)\n  - This function is responsible for extracting assertion expressions and determining which lines to include in error messages\n  - Uses tokenization to parse source code and track assertion statements\n\n### 3. Deep Code Analysis and Bug Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` (lines 556-620, 605-620)\n- **Critical Discovery**: Found the exact bug location and root cause\n- **Analysis Results**:\n  - Examined complete `_get_assertion_exprs()` function implementation\n  - Traced assertion expression formatting flow through `format_explanation` in `util.py`\n  - Identified how assertion expressions are used in error message generation\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### Critical Function: `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n- **Purpose**: Returns a mapping from line numbers to assertion test expressions\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, lines 556-609\n- **Key Logic**:\n  - Uses `tokenize.tokenize()` to parse source code\n  - Tracks assertion statements by looking for `tokenize.NAME` tokens with value \"assert\"\n  - Maintains depth tracking for parentheses/brackets to handle multi-line assertions\n  - Collects lines in a `lines` list and tracks `seen_lines` to avoid duplicates\n\n### **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Overly Permissive Line Collection Logic\n\n**The Bug Location**: Lines 605-607 in `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\n**Problem Analysis**:\n- This condition adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before\n- In Python 3.9, tokenizer behavior changed and now includes decorator lines like `@t` in the token stream after assertions\n- The logic lacks proper termination conditions to stop collecting assertion-related lines\n- When encountering a decorator after an assertion, it incorrectly includes the decorator line in the assertion expression\n\n**Bug Flow in Python 3.9**:\n1. Tokenizer encounters `assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)`\n2. Sets `assert_lineno` and starts collecting lines  \n3. Tokenizer continues and encounters `@t` decorator on next line\n4. Condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` evaluates to true\n5. Decorator line `@t` gets added to assertion expression\n6. Assertion failure displays both assertion and decorator line incorrectly\n\n## **PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\n### Primary Bug Locations Identified:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 605-607** - **PRIMARY BUG LOCATION**\n- The overly permissive line collection logic that incorrectly includes decorator lines\n- **Fix Required**: Add proper termination conditions to stop collecting lines when encountering decorators or other non-assertion tokens\n\n**Location 2: Lines 578-579** - Related logic\n- The assertion detection logic that starts the line collection process\n\n**Location 3: Lines 587-589** - Related logic  \n- The initial line collection logic that starts gathering assertion lines\n\n**Location 4: Lines 603-604** - Related logic\n- The termination conditions that should properly end line collection\n\n**Location 5: Lines 567-574** - Related logic\n- The `_write_and_reset` function that finalizes the collected assertion expression\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Project structure mapped\n- Assertion handling code located\n- Key function `_get_assertion_exprs()` identified and fully analyzed\n- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Overly permissive line collection logic at lines 605-607\n- **BUG LOCATIONS PINPOINTED**: Specific lines requiring fixes identified\n- Understanding of tokenization-based line extraction approach\n- Traced assertion expression formatting flow through util.py\n- Analyzed Python 3.9-specific tokenization behavior changes\n\n### 🔄 Ready for Implementation\n- **Exact fix location identified**: Lines 605-607 in `_get_assertion_exprs()`\n- **Fix strategy determined**: Add proper termination conditions for line collection\n- **Impact assessment complete**: Changes needed in tokenization logic\n\n### ⏳ Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement fix** to add proper termination conditions in lines 605-607\n2. **Create test case** to reproduce the bug with decorator + assertion scenario  \n3. **Test fix** across different Python versions to ensure compatibility\n4. **Validate fix** doesn't break existing assertion error formatting\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: For project structure navigation\n- `read_file_lines`: For examining specific code sections (556-620, 605-620)\n- `search_code_with_context`: For finding assertion-related code patterns\n\n## Key Technical Context\nThe bug is definitively located in pytest's assertion rewriting system, specifically in the `_get_assertion_exprs()` function's line collection logic. The issue is caused by Python 3.9's changes in tokenization behavior for decorated functions, causing pytest to incorrectly include decorator lines in assertion error output due to overly permissive line collection conditions at lines 605-607.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nStart line: 605\nEnd line: 607\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nStart line: 578\nEnd line: 579\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nStart line: 587\nEnd line: 589\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nStart line: 603\nEnd line: 604\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\nStart line: 567\nEnd line: 574\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete problem statement. The bug is exactly as I analyzed - in Python 3.9, pytest's assertion error messages incorrectly include extra code lines (specifically the `@t` decorator line) that should not be part of the assertion expression display.\n\nThe user provided a clear test case showing:\n1. In Python 3.9: The assertion error incorrectly shows both the assertion line AND the `@t` decorator line\n2. In Python 3.7: The assertion error correctly shows only the assertion line\n\nThis confirms my analysis that the issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function where the line collection logic is too permissive in Python 3.9 due to tokenizer behavior changes.\n\nI'm ready to propose specific repair suggestions for each of the identified bug locations.\n\nS\n\n1. **[Lines 605-607] - Primary Fix**: Replace the overly permissive line collection condition with proper validation logic. The current `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` should be enhanced to check if the token is actually part of the assertion expression.

This function extracts assertion expressions from source code using tokenization, but it has a flaw in its line collection logic that manifests in Python 3.9.\n\n**Root Cause**: The condition at lines 605-607 is too permissive:\n```python\nelif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n    lines.append(line)\n    seen_lines.add(lineno)\n```\n\nThis logic adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts (`lines` is not empty) and hasn't been seen before. In Python 3.9, the tokenizer behavior changed, and when it encounters a decorator like `@t` after an assertion, it includes that decorator line as part of the token stream, causing it to be incorrectly added to the assertion expression.\n\n**The Problem Flow**:\n1. Tokenizer encounters `assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)` \n2. Sets `assert_lineno` and starts collecting lines\n3. In Python 3.9, tokenizer continues and encounters the `@t` decorator on the next line\n4. The condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` is true\n5. The decorator line `@t` gets added to the assertion expression\n6. When the assertion fails, pytest displays both the assertion and the decorator line\n\n## Locations to Fix\n\n**Location 1: Lines 605-607** - Primary bug location\nThe overly permissive line collection logic that incorrectly includes decorator lines.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 578-579** - Related logic\nThe assertion detection logic that starts the line collection process.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 587-589** - Related logic  \nThe initial line collection logic that starts gathering assertion lines.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 603-604** - Related logic\nThe termination conditions that should properly end line collection.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 567-574** - Related logic\nThe `_write_and_reset` function that finalizes the collected assertion expression.\n\nThe fix should add proper termination conditions to stop collecting lines when encountering decorators or other non-assertion tokens, specifically targeting the logic at lines 605-607 to be more restrictive about what constitutes a valid continuation of an assertion expression.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where pytest incorrectly includes extra code lines (specifically decorator lines like `@t`) in assertion error messages when running on Python 3.9, I have identified the root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function in the assertion rewriting module. The function uses tokenization to extract assertion expressions, but has overly permissive line collection logic that incorrectly includes decorator lines in Python 3.9 due to changes in tokenizer behavior.\n\nThe primary bug is at lines 605-607 where the condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` adds ANY line that comes after an assertion starts, without proper validation that the line is actually part of the assertion expression.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 605,\n            \"end_line\": 607\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 578,\n            \"end_line\": 579\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 587,\n            \"end_line\": 589\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 603,\n            \"end_line\": 604\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 567,\n            \"end_line\": 574\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete problem statement. The bug is exactly as I analyzed - in Python 3.9, pytest's assertion error messages incorrectly include extra code lines (specifically the `@t` decorator line) that should not be part of the assertion expression display.\n\nThe user provided a clear test case showing:\n1. In Python 3.9: The assertion error incorrectly shows both the assertion line AND the `@t` decorator line\n2. In Python 3.7: The assertion error correctly shows only the assertion line\n\nThis confirms my analysis that the issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function where the line collection logic is too permissive in Python 3.9 due to tokenizer behavior changes.\n\nI'm ready to propose specific repair suggestions for each of the identified bug locations.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **[Lines 605-607] - Primary Fix**: Replace the overly permissive line collection condition with proper validation logic. The current `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` should be enhanced to check if the token is actually part of the assertion expression. Add validation to ensure we only collect lines that contain assertion-related tokens (operators, operands, parentheses, etc.) and stop collection when encountering decorators (`@` symbol) or function definitions (`def` keyword).\n\n2. **[Lines 578-579] - Assertion Detection Enhancement**: Enhance the assertion detection logic to better track the scope of assertion expressions. When `tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\"` is detected, initialize additional state variables to track the expected end of the assertion (e.g., when we encounter a newline followed by non-continuation tokens).\n\n3. **[Lines 587-589] - Initial Line Collection Logic**: Strengthen the initial line collection logic to establish clearer boundaries for what constitutes the assertion expression. Add validation that the line being collected is syntactically related to the assertion statement and not a separate code construct.\n\n4. **[Lines 603-604] - Termination Conditions**: Enhance the existing termination conditions to properly handle Python 3.9's tokenizer behavior. Add specific checks for decorator tokens (`@` symbol) and function definition keywords (`def`) that should immediately terminate assertion line collection, preventing decorator lines from being included in assertion expressions.\n\n5. **[Lines 567-574] - Write and Reset Function**: Modify the `_write_and_reset` function to include additional validation before finalizing the collected assertion expression. Add a final filter to remove any lines that don't belong to the assertion (like decorator lines that may have been incorrectly collected) before writing the expression to the result mapping.\n\nThese coordinated changes will ensure that assertion expressions are properly bounded and don't include extraneous code lines like decorators, specifically addressing the Python 3.9 tokenizer behavior changes while maintaining compatibility with earlier Python versions.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py lines 605-607\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n                lines.append(line)\n                seen_lines.add(lineno)\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py lines 578-579\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        if tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\":\n            assert_lineno = lineno\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py lines 587-589\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if not lines:\n                lines.append(line[offset:])\n                seen_lines.add(lineno)\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py lines 603-604\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            elif tp in {tokenize.NEWLINE, tokenize.ENDMARKER}:\n                _write_and_reset()\n\n\n[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py lines 567-574\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def _write_and_reset() -> None:\n        nonlocal depth, lines, assert_lineno, seen_lines\n        assert assert_lineno is not None\n        ret[assert_lineno] = \"\".join(lines).rstrip().rstrip(\"\\\\\")\n        depth = 0\n        lines = []\n        assert_lineno = None\n        seen_lines = set()\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n#REFLECT\nLooking at the provided code segments, I can see the exact implementation of the bug locations I identified. Let me analyze each location:\n\n**Location 1 (lines 605-607)**: This is indeed the primary bug location. The condition `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` is too permissive and will add any line that comes after an assertion starts, including decorator lines like `@t`.\n\n**Location 2 (lines 578-579)**: This is where assertion detection begins - when it finds `assert` token, it sets `assert_lineno`.\n\n**Location 3 (lines 587-589)**: This is where line collection starts for the assertion.\n\n**Location 4 (lines 603-604)**: This handles termination on NEWLINE/ENDMARKER tokens.\n\n**Location 5 (lines 567-574)**: This is the `_write_and_reset` function that finalizes the collected assertion expression.\n\nThe problem is clear: Location 1 needs to be more restrictive about what lines it includes. It should not include decorator lines (`@t`) that come after an assertion. The fix needs to add proper validation to check if the current token is actually part of the assertion expression before adding the line.\n\nThese locations are ready for fixing. The primary fix will be at Location 1 to add proper termination conditions, with supporting changes at the other locations to ensure proper coordination.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/pytest/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py lines 605-607\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import ast\n  import errno\n  import functools\n  import importlib.abc\n  import importlib.machinery\n  import importlib.util\n  import io\n  import itertools\n  import marshal\n  import os\n  import struct\n  import sys\n  import tokenize\n  import types\n  from pathlib import Path\n  from pathlib import PurePath\n  from typing import Callable\n  from typing import Dict\n  from typing import IO\n  from typing import Iterable\n  from typing import Iterator\n  from typing import List\n  from typing import Optional\n  from typing import Sequence\n  from typing import Set\n  from typing import Tuple\n  from typing import TYPE_CHECKING\n  from typing import Union\n  from _pytest._io.saferepr import DEFAULT_REPR_MAX_SIZE\n  from _pytest._io.saferepr import saferepr\n  from _pytest._version import version\n  from _pytest.assertion import util\n  from _pytest.assertion.util import (  # noqa: F401\n  from _pytest.config import Config\n  from _pytest.main import Session\n  from _pytest.pathlib import absolutepath\n  from _pytest.pathlib import fnmatch_ex\n  from _pytest.stash import StashKey\n  from _pytest.assertion import AssertionState\n  from _pytest.warning_types import PytestAssertRewriteWarning\n  from types import SimpleNamespace\n  from importlib.readers import FileReader\n  from atomicwrites import atomic_write\n  from _pytest.warning_types import PytestAssertRewriteWarning\n  import warnings\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  595:                     lines[-1] = lines[-1][:offset_in_trimmed]\n[C]  596:                 # multi-line assert with message\n[C]  597:                 elif lineno in seen_lines:\n[C]  598:                     lines[-1] = lines[-1][:offset]\n[C]  599:                 # multi line assert with escapd newline before message\n[C]  600:                 else:\n[C]  601:                     lines.append(line[:offset])\n[C]  602:                 _write_and_reset()\n[C]  603:             elif tp in {tokenize.NEWLINE, tokenize.ENDMARKER}:\n[C]  604:                 _write_and_reset()\n[R]  605:             elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:\n[R]  606:                 lines.append(line)\n[R]  607:                 seen_lines.add(lineno)\n[C]  608: \n[C]  609:     return ret\n[C]  610: \n[C]  611: \n[C]  612: class AssertionRewriter(ast.NodeVisitor):\n[C]  613:     \"\"\"Assertion rewriting implementation.\n[C]  614: \n[C]  615:     The main entrypoint is to call .run() with an ast.Module instance,\n[C]  616:     this will then find all the assert statements and rewrite them to\n[C]  617:     provide intermediate values and a detailed assertion error.

The bug is exactly as I analyzed - in Python 3.9, pytest's assertion error messages incorrectly include extra code lines (specifically the `@t` decorator line) that should not be part of the assertion expression display.\n\nThe user provided a clear test case showing:\n1. In Python 3.9: The assertion error incorrectly shows both the assertion line AND the `@t` decorator line\n2. In Python 3.7: The assertion error correctly shows only the assertion line\n\nThis confirms my analysis that the issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function where the line collection logic is too permissive in Python 3.9 due to tokenizer behavior changes.\n\nI'm ready to propose specific repair suggestions for each of the identified bug locations.\n\nS\n\n1. **[Lines 605-607] - Primary Fix**: Replace the overly permissive line collection condition with proper validation logic. The current `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` should be enhanced to check if the token is actually part of the assertion expression. Add validation to ensure we only collect lines that contain assertion-related tokens (operators, operands, parentheses, etc.) and stop collection when encountering decorators (`@` symbol) or function definitions (`def` keyword).\n\n2. **[Lines 578-579] - Assertion Detection Enhancement**: Enhance the assertion detection logic to better track the scope of assertion expressions. When `tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\"` is detected, initialize additional state variables to track the expected end of the assertion (e.g., when we encounter a newline followed by non-continuation tokens).\n\n3. **[Lines 587-589] - Initial Line Collection Logic**: Strengthen the initial line collection logic to establish clearer boundaries for what constitutes the assertion expression. Add validation that the line being collected is syntactically related to the assertion statement and not a separate code construct.\n\n4. **[Lines 603-604] - Termination Conditions**: Enhance the existing termination conditions to properly handle Python 3.9's tokenizer behavior. Add specific checks for decorator tokens (`@` symbol) and function definition keywords (`def`) that should immediately terminate assertion line collection, preventing decorator lines from being included in assertion expressions.\n\n5. **[Lines 567-574] - Write and Reset Function**: Modify the `_write_and_reset` function to include additional validation before finalizing the collected assertion expression. Add a final filter to remove any lines that don't belong to the assertion (like decorator lines that may have been incorrectly collected) before writing the expression to the result mapping.\n\nThese coordinated changes will ensure that assertion expressions are properly bounded and don't include extraneous code lines like decorators, specifically addressing the Python 3.9 tokenizer behavior changes while maintaining compatibility with earlier Python versions.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nError message prints extra code line when using assert in python3.9\n<!--\r\nThanks for submitting an issue!\r\n\r\nQuick check-list while reporting bugs:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] a detailed description of the bug or problem you are having\r\n- [x] output of `pip list` from the virtual environment you are using\r\n- [x] pytest and operating system versions\r\n- [ ] minimal example if possible\r\n### Description\r\nI have a test like this:\r\n```\r\nfrom pytest import fixture\r\n\r\n\r\ndef t(foo):\r\n    return foo\r\n\r\n\r\n@fixture\r\ndef foo():\r\n    return 1\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_right_statement(foo):\r\n    assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)\r\n\r\n    @t\r\n    def inner():\r\n        return 2\r\n\r\n    assert 2 == inner\r\n\r\n\r\n@t\r\ndef outer():\r\n    return 2\r\n```\r\nThe test \"test_right_statement\" fails at the first assertion,but print extra code (the \"t\" decorator) in error details, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n ============================= test session starts =============================\r\nplatform win32 -- Python 3.9.6, pytest-6.2.5, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1 -- \r\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\r\nrootdir: \r\nplugins: allure-pytest-2.9.45\r\ncollecting ... collected 1 item\r\n\r\ntest_statement.py::test_right_statement FAILED                           [100%]\r\n\r\n================================== FAILURES ===================================\r\n____________________________ test_right_statement _____________________________\r\n\r\nfoo = 1\r\n\r\n    def test_right_statement(foo):\r\n>       assert foo == (3 + 2) * (6 + 9)\r\n    \r\n        @t\r\nE       assert 1 == 75\r\nE         +1\r\nE         -75\r\n\r\ntest_statement.py:14: AssertionError\r\n=========================== short test summary info ===========================\r\nFAILED test_statement.py::test_right_statement -

In Python 3.7: The assertion error correctly shows only the assertion line\n\nThis confirms my analysis that the issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function where the line collection logic is too permissive in Python 3.9 due to tokenizer behavior changes.\n\nI'm ready to propose specific repair suggestions for each of the identified bug locations.\n\nS\n\n1. **[Lines 605-607] - Primary Fix**: Replace the overly permissive line collection condition with proper validation logic. The current `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` should be enhanced to check if the token is actually part of the assertion expression. Add validation to ensure we only collect lines that contain assertion-related tokens (operators, operands, parentheses, etc.) and stop collection when encountering decorators (`@` symbol) or function definitions (`def` keyword).\n\n2. **[Lines 578-579] - Assertion Detection Enhancement**: Enhance the assertion detection logic to better track the scope of assertion expressions. When `tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\"` is detected, initialize additional state variables to track the expected end of the assertion (e.g., when we encounter a newline followed by non-continuation tokens).\n\n3. **[Lines 587-589] - Initial Line Collection Logic**: Strengthen the initial line collection logic to establish clearer boundaries for what constitutes the assertion expression. Add validation that the line being collected is syntactically related to the assertion statement and not a separate code construct.\n\n4. **[Lines 603-604] - Termination Conditions**: Enhance the existing termination conditions to properly handle Python 3.9's tokenizer behavior. Add specific checks for decorator tokens (`@` symbol) and function definition keywords (`def`) that should immediately terminate assertion line collection, preventing decorator lines from being included in assertion expressions.\n\n5. **[Lines 567-574] - Write and Reset Function**: Modify the `_write_and_reset` function to include additional validation before finalizing the collected assertion expression. Add a final filter to remove any lines that don't belong to the assertion (like decorator lines that may have been incorrectly collected) before writing the expression to the result mapping.\n\nThese coordinated changes will ensure that assertion expressions are properly bounded and don't include extraneous code lines like decorators, specifically addressing the Python 3.9 tokenizer behavior changes while maintaining compatibility with earlier Python versions.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

The bug is exactly as I analyzed - in Python 3.9, pytest's assertion error messages incorrectly include extra code lines (specifically the `@t` decorator line) that should not be part of the assertion expression display.\n\nThe user provided a clear test case showing:\n1. In Python 3.9: The assertion error incorrectly shows both the assertion line AND the `@t` decorator line\n2. In Python 3.7: The assertion error correctly shows only the assertion line\n\nThis confirms my analysis that the issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function where the line collection logic is too permissive in Python 3.9 due to tokenizer behavior changes.\n\nI'm ready to propose specific repair suggestions for each of the identified bug locations.\n\nS\n\n1. **[Lines 605-607] - Primary Fix**: Replace the overly permissive line collection condition with proper validation logic. The current `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` should be enhanced to check if the token is actually part of the assertion expression. Add validation to ensure we only collect lines that contain assertion-related tokens (operators, operands, parentheses, etc.) and stop collection when encountering decorators (`@` symbol) or function definitions (`def` keyword).\n\n2. **[Lines 578-579] - Assertion Detection Enhancement**: Enhance the assertion detection logic to better track the scope of assertion expressions. When `tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\"` is detected, initialize additional state variables to track the expected end of the assertion (e.g., when we encounter a newline followed by non-continuation tokens).\n\n3. **[Lines 587-589] - Initial Line Collection Logic**: Strengthen the initial line collection logic to establish clearer boundaries for what constitutes the assertion expression. Add validation that the line being collected is syntactically related to the assertion statement and not a separate code construct.\n\n4. **[Lines 603-604] - Termination Conditions**: Enhance the existing termination conditions to properly handle Python 3.9's tokenizer behavior. Add specific checks for decorator tokens (`@` symbol) and function definition keywords (`def`) that should immediately terminate assertion line collection, preventing decorator lines from being included in assertion expressions.\n\n5. **[Lines 567-574] - Write and Reset Function**: Modify the `_write_and_reset` function to include additional validation before finalizing the collected assertion expression. Add a final filter to remove any lines that don't belong to the assertion (like decorator lines that may have been incorrectly collected) before writing the expression to the result mapping.\n\nThese coordinated changes will ensure that assertion expressions are properly bounded and don't include extraneous code lines like decorators, specifically addressing the Python 3.9 tokenizer behavior changes while maintaining compatibility with earlier Python versions.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

In Python 3.7: The assertion error correctly shows only the assertion line\n\nThis confirms my analysis that the issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function where the line collection logic is too permissive in Python 3.9 due to tokenizer behavior changes.\n\nI'm ready to propose specific repair suggestions for each of the identified bug locations.\n\nS\n\n1. **[Lines 605-607] - Primary Fix**: Replace the overly permissive line collection condition with proper validation logic. The current `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` should be enhanced to check if the token is actually part of the assertion expression. Add validation to ensure we only collect lines that contain assertion-related tokens (operators, operands, parentheses, etc.) and stop collection when encountering decorators (`@` symbol) or function definitions (`def` keyword).\n\n2. **[Lines 578-579] - Assertion Detection Enhancement**: Enhance the assertion detection logic to better track the scope of assertion expressions. When `tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\"` is detected, initialize additional state variables to track the expected end of the assertion (e.g., when we encounter a newline followed by non-continuation tokens).\n\n3. **[Lines 587-589] - Initial Line Collection Logic**: Strengthen the initial line collection logic to establish clearer boundaries for what constitutes the assertion expression. Add validation that the line being collected is syntactically related to the assertion statement and not a separate code construct.\n\n4. **[Lines 603-604] - Termination Conditions**: Enhance the existing termination conditions to properly handle Python 3.9's tokenizer behavior. Add specific checks for decorator tokens (`@` symbol) and function definition keywords (`def`) that should immediately terminate assertion line collection, preventing decorator lines from being included in assertion expressions.\n\n5. **[Lines 567-574] - Write and Reset Function**: Modify the `_write_and_reset` function to include additional validation before finalizing the collected assertion expression. Add a final filter to remove any lines that don't belong to the assertion (like decorator lines that may have been incorrectly collected) before writing the expression to the result mapping.\n\nThese coordinated changes will ensure that assertion expressions are properly bounded and don't include extraneous code lines like decorators, specifically addressing the Python 3.9 tokenizer behavior changes while maintaining compatibility with earlier Python versions.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

The current `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` should be enhanced to check if the token is actually part of the assertion expression. Add validation to ensure we only collect lines that contain assertion-related tokens (operators, operands, parentheses, etc.) and stop collection when encountering decorators (`@` symbol) or function definitions (`def` keyword).\n\n2. **[Lines 578-579] - Assertion Detection Enhancement**: Enhance the assertion detection logic to better track the scope of assertion expressions. When `tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\"` is detected, initialize additional state variables to track the expected end of the assertion (e.g., when we encounter a newline followed by non-continuation tokens).\n\n3. **[Lines 587-589] - Initial Line Collection Logic**: Strengthen the initial line collection logic to establish clearer boundaries for what constitutes the assertion expression. Add validation that the line being collected is syntactically related to the assertion statement and not a separate code construct.\n\n4. **[Lines 603-604] - Termination Conditions**: Enhance the existing termination conditions to properly handle Python 3.9's tokenizer behavior. Add specific checks for decorator tokens (`@` symbol) and function definition keywords (`def`) that should immediately terminate assertion line collection, preventing decorator lines from being included in assertion expressions.\n\n5. **[Lines 567-574] - Write and Reset Function**: Modify the `_write_and_reset` function to include additional validation before finalizing the collected assertion expression. Add a final filter to remove any lines that don't belong to the assertion (like decorator lines that may have been incorrectly collected) before writing the expression to the result mapping.\n\nThese coordinated changes will ensure that assertion expressions are properly bounded and don't include extraneous code lines like decorators, specifically addressing the Python 3.9 tokenizer behavior changes while maintaining compatibility with earlier Python versions.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

The bug is exactly as I analyzed - in Python 3.9, pytest's assertion error messages incorrectly include extra code lines (specifically the `@t` decorator line) that should not be part of the assertion expression display.\n\nThe user provided a clear test case showing:\n1. In Python 3.9: The assertion error incorrectly shows both the assertion line AND the `@t` decorator line\n2. In Python 3.7: The assertion error correctly shows only the assertion line\n\nThis confirms my analysis that the issue is in the `_get_assertion_exprs` function where the line collection logic is too permissive in Python 3.9 due to tokenizer behavior changes.\n\nI'm ready to propose specific repair suggestions for each of the identified bug locations.\n\nS\n\n1. **[Lines 605-607] - Primary Fix**: Replace the overly permissive line collection condition with proper validation logic. The current `elif lines and lineno not in seen_lines:` should be enhanced to check if the token is actually part of the assertion expression. Add validation to ensure we only collect lines that contain assertion-related tokens (operators, operands, parentheses, etc.) and stop collection when encountering decorators (`@` symbol) or function definitions (`def` keyword).\n\n2. **[Lines 578-579] - Assertion Detection Enhancement**: Enhance the assertion detection logic to better track the scope of assertion expressions. When `tp == tokenize.NAME and source == \"assert\"` is detected, initialize additional state variables to track the expected end of the assertion (e.g., when we encounter a newline followed by non-continuation tokens).\n\n3. **[Lines 587-589] - Initial Line Collection Logic**: Strengthen the initial line collection logic to establish clearer boundaries for what constitutes the assertion expression. Add validation that the line being collected is syntactically related to the assertion statement and not a separate code construct.\n\n4. **[Lines 603-604] - Termination Conditions**: Enhance the existing termination conditions to properly handle Python 3.9's tokenizer behavior. Add specific checks for decorator tokens (`@` symbol) and function definition keywords (`def`) that should immediately terminate assertion line collection, preventing decorator lines from being included in assertion expressions.\n\n5. **[Lines 567-574] - Write and Reset Function**: Modify the `_write_and_reset` function to include additional validation before finalizing the collected assertion expression. Add a final filter to remove any lines that don't belong to the assertion (like decorator lines that may have been incorrectly collected) before writing the expression to the result mapping.\n\nThese coordinated changes will ensure that assertion expressions are properly bounded and don't include extraneous code lines like decorators, specifically addressing the Python 3.9 tokenizer behavior changes while maintaining compatibility with earlier Python versions.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",
