The issue is in the `iter_modules_and_files` function where `path.resolve()` can encounter embedded null bytes in filesystem paths, particularly when dealing with symlinks or special filesystem conditions like network mounts.\n\nLooking at the current code vs the stack trace:\n- **Stack trace shows error at line 132**: `results.add(path.resolve().absolute())`  \n- **Current code at line 141**: `resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()`\n\nThe current code has a try-catch for `FileNotFoundError` but doesn't handle `ValueError` for embedded null bytes. The fix is to catch `ValueError` as well and skip problematic paths.\n\nLet me examine the exact lines that need to be fixed:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py\", \"start_line\": 135, \"end_line\": 150 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py\nTotal lines: 600\nShowing lines 135-150:\n\n 135:     results = set()\n 136:     for filename in itertools.chain(sys_file_paths, extra_files):\n 137:         if not filename:\n 138:             continue\n 139:         path = Path(filename)\n 140:         try:\n 141:             resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()\n 142:         except FileNotFoundError:\n 143:             # The module could have been removed, don't fail loudly if this\n 144:             # is the case.\n 145:             continue\n 146:         results.add(resolved_path)\n 147:     return frozenset(results)\n 148: \n 149: \n 150: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n\nBased on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I have identified the bug and its location. The issue is in the `iter_modules_and_files` function where `path.resolve()` can encounter embedded null bytes in filesystem paths, particularly when dealing with symlinks or special filesystem conditions like network mounts.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. The error occurs when pathlib's `resolve()` method encounters a filesystem path containing embedded null bytes\n2. This happens intermittently, likely when network mounts or special symlinks are present\n3. The current code only catches `FileNotFoundError` but not `ValueError` for embedded null bytes\n4. The stack trace shows the error at line 132, but the current code has evolved and the vulnerable code is now at line 141\n\n**Bug Location:**\nThe vulnerable code is in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py` in the `iter_modules_and_files` function, specifically in the exception handling block that processes file paths.\n\n**Locations to fix:**\n\n1. **Lines 140-146**: The main exception handling block needs to catch `ValueError` in addition to `FileNotFoundError` to handle embedded null bytes gracefully.\n\nThe fix involves expanding the exception handling to catch `ValueError` (which includes the \"embedded null byte\" error) and skip problematic paths instead of crashing the entire autoreload system.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAuto-reloading with StatReloader very intermittently throws \"ValueError: embedded null byte\".\nDescription\n\t\nRaising this mainly so that it's tracked, as I have no idea how to reproduce it, nor why it's happening.

The issue is in the `iter_modules_and_files` function where `path.resolve()` can encounter embedded null bytes in filesystem paths, particularly when dealing with symlinks or special filesystem conditions like network mounts.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. The error occurs when pathlib's `resolve()` method encounters a filesystem path containing embedded null bytes\n2. This happens intermittently, likely when network mounts or special symlinks are present\n3. The current code only catches `FileNotFoundError` but not `ValueError` for embedded null bytes\n4.

Now I can see the exact issue.

The current code has a try-catch for `FileNotFoundError` but doesn't handle `ValueError` for embedded null bytes.\n\nLet me examine the imports to understand what's available:\n\n#TOOL_CALL show_file_imports { \"python_file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\n['import functools\\n', 'import itertools\\n', 'import logging\\n', 'import os\\n', 'import signal\\n', 'import subprocess\\n', 'import sys\\n', 'import threading\\n', 'import time\\n', 'import traceback\\n', 'import weakref\\n', 'from collections import defaultdict\\n', 'from pathlib import Path\\n', 'from types import ModuleType\\n', 'from zipimport import zipimporter\\n', '\\nfrom django.apps import apps\\n', 'from django.core.signals import request_finished\\n', 'from django.dispatch import Signal\\n', 'from django.utils.functional import cached_property\\n', 'from django.utils.version import get_version_tuple\\n', '    import termios\\n', '    import pywatchman\\n', '    import django.__main__\\n', '        from django.urls import get_resolver\\n']\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug. The issue is in the `iter_modules_and_files` function where `path.resolve()` can encounter embedded null bytes in filesystem paths, particularly when dealing with symlinks or special filesystem conditions like network mounts.\n\nLooking at the current code vs the stack trace:\n- **Stack trace shows error at line 132**: `results.add(path.resolve().absolute())`  \n- **Current code at line 141**: `resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()`\n\nThe current code has a try-catch for `FileNotFoundError` but doesn't handle `ValueError` for embedded null bytes. The fix is to catch `ValueError` as well and skip problematic paths.\n\nLet me examine the exact lines that need to be fixed:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py\", \"start_line\": 135, \"end_line\": 150 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py\nTotal lines: 600\nShowing lines 135-150:\n\n 135:     results = set()\n 136:     for filename in itertools.chain(sys_file_paths, extra_files):\n 137:         if not filename:\n 138:             continue\n 139:         path = Path(filename)\n 140:         try:\n 141:             resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()\n 142:         except FileNotFoundError:\n 143:             # The module could have been removed, don't fail loudly if this\n 144:             # is the case.\n 145:             continue\n 146:         results.add(resolved_path)\n 147:     return frozenset(results)\n 148: \n 149: \n 150: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n\nBased on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I have identified the bug and its location. The issue is in the `iter_modules_and_files` function where `path.resolve()` can encounter embedded null bytes in filesystem paths, particularly when dealing with symlinks or special filesystem conditions like network mounts.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. The error occurs when pathlib's `resolve()` method encounters a filesystem path containing embedded null bytes\n2. This happens intermittently, likely when network mounts or special symlinks are present\n3. The current code only catches `FileNotFoundError` but not `ValueError` for embedded null bytes\n4. The stack trace shows the error at line 132, but the current code has evolved and the vulnerable code is now at line 141\n\n**Bug Location:**\nThe vulnerable code is in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py` in the `iter_modules_and_files` function, specifically in the exception handling block that processes file paths.\n\n**Locations to fix:**\n\n1. **Lines 140-146**: The main exception handling block needs to catch `ValueError` in addition to `FileNotFoundError` to handle embedded null bytes gracefully.\n\nThe fix involves expanding the exception handling to catch `ValueError` (which includes the \"embedded null byte\" error) and skip problematic paths instead of crashing the entire autoreload system.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I have identified the root cause of the bug. The issue is in the `iter_modules_and_files` function where `path.resolve()` encounters embedded null bytes in filesystem paths, particularly when dealing with symlinks or special filesystem conditions like network mounts.\n\nThe current code only catches `FileNotFoundError` but doesn't handle `ValueError` for embedded null bytes, causing the entire autoreload system to crash intermittently.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 140,\n            \"end_line\": 146\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe fix involves expanding the exception handling in the `iter_modules_and_files` function to catch `ValueError` (which includes the \"embedded null byte\" error) in addition to `FileNotFoundError`, allowing the system to skip problematic paths gracefully instead of crashing.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context. The problem statement confirms my analysis:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: The `ValueError: embedded null byte` occurs when pathlib's `resolve()` method encounters filesystem paths with embedded null bytes, particularly around `/Users` directory which likely has network mounts or special symlinks.\n\n2. **Stack Trace Analysis**: The error occurs at line 132 in `iter_modules_and_files` where `path.resolve().absolute()` is called, but in the current code I examined, this logic is now at lines 140-146 with slightly different implementation.\n\n3. **Current Implementation**: The code now uses `path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()` and has a try-catch for `FileNotFoundError` but doesn't handle `ValueError` for embedded null bytes.\n\n4. **Intermittent Nature**: The issue is intermittent because it depends on filesystem state - network mounts, symlink resolution, and timing of when certain paths are accessed.\n\nThe fix is clear: expand the exception handling to catch `ValueError` in addition to `FileNotFoundError` and skip problematic paths gracefully.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Lines 140-146 in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py`**: Expand the exception handling in the `iter_modules_and_files` function to catch `ValueError` (which includes \"embedded null byte\" errors) in addition to `FileNotFoundError`. This allows the autoreload system to skip problematic filesystem paths gracefully instead of crashing. The fix should change the except clause from `except FileNotFoundError:` to `except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError):` and update the comment to reflect that it also handles filesystem paths with embedded null bytes or other path resolution issues.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py lines 140-146\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        try:\n            resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            # The module could have been removed, don't fail loudly if this\n            # is the case.\n            continue\n        results.add(resolved_path)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAuto-reloading with StatReloader very intermittently throws \"ValueError: embedded null byte\".\nDescription\n\t\nRaising this mainly so that it's tracked, as I have no idea how to reproduce it, nor why it's happening.

Now I can see the exact issue. Looking at the code and the stack trace, I can identify the problem:\n\n1. **Current code at line 141**: `resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()`\n2. **Stack trace shows error at line 132**: `results.add(path.resolve().absolute())`\n\nThe issue is that `path.resolve()` can encounter embedded null bytes in filesystem paths, particularly when dealing with symlinks or special filesystem conditions. The current code has a try-catch for `FileNotFoundError` but doesn't handle `ValueError` for embedded null bytes.\n\nLet me examine the imports to understand what's available:\n\n#TOOL_CALL show_file_imports { \"python_file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\n['import functools\\n', 'import itertools\\n', 'import logging\\n', 'import os\\n', 'import signal\\n', 'import subprocess\\n', 'import sys\\n', 'import threading\\n', 'import time\\n', 'import traceback\\n', 'import weakref\\n', 'from collections import defaultdict\\n', 'from pathlib import Path\\n', 'from types import ModuleType\\n', 'from zipimport import zipimporter\\n', '\\nfrom django.apps import apps\\n', 'from django.core.signals import request_finished\\n', 'from django.dispatch import Signal\\n', 'from django.utils.functional import cached_property\\n', 'from django.utils.version import get_version_tuple\\n', '    import termios\\n', '    import pywatchman\\n', '    import django.__main__\\n', '        from django.urls import get_resolver\\n']\n\nAssistant: Now I have a clear understanding of the bug. The issue is in the `iter_modules_and_files` function where `path.resolve()` can encounter embedded null bytes in filesystem paths, particularly when dealing with symlinks or special filesystem conditions like network mounts.\n\nLooking at the current code vs the stack trace:\n- **Stack trace shows error at line 132**: `results.add(path.resolve().absolute())`  \n- **Current code at line 141**: `resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()`\n\nThe current code has a try-catch for `FileNotFoundError` but doesn't handle `ValueError` for embedded null bytes. The fix is to catch `ValueError` as well and skip problematic paths.\n\nLet me examine the exact lines that need to be fixed:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py\", \"start_line\": 135, \"end_line\": 150 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py\nTotal lines: 600\nShowing lines 135-150:\n\n 135:     results = set()\n 136:     for filename in itertools.chain(sys_file_paths, extra_files):\n 137:         if not filename:\n 138:             continue\n 139:         path = Path(filename)\n 140:         try:\n 141:             resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()\n 142:         except FileNotFoundError:\n 143:             # The module could have been removed, don't fail loudly if this\n 144:             # is the case.\n 145:             continue\n 146:         results.add(resolved_path)\n 147:     return frozenset(results)\n 148: \n 149: \n 150: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n\n\nAssistant: Based on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I have identified the bug and its location. The issue is in the `iter_modules_and_files` function where `path.resolve()` can encounter embedded null bytes in filesystem paths, particularly when dealing with symlinks or special filesystem conditions like network mounts.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. The error occurs when pathlib's `resolve()` method encounters a filesystem path containing embedded null bytes\n2. This happens intermittently, likely when network mounts or special symlinks are present\n3. The current code only catches `FileNotFoundError` but not `ValueError` for embedded null bytes\n4. The stack trace shows the error at line 132, but the current code has evolved and the vulnerable code is now at line 141\n\n**Bug Location:**\nThe vulnerable code is in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py` in the `iter_modules_and_files` function, specifically in the exception handling block that processes file paths.\n\n**Locations to fix:**\n\n1. **Lines 140-146**: The main exception handling block needs to catch `ValueError` in addition to `FileNotFoundError` to handle embedded null bytes gracefully.\n\nThe fix involves expanding the exception handling to catch `ValueError` (which includes the \"embedded null byte\" error) and skip problematic paths instead of crashing the entire autoreload system.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: **PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I have identified the root cause of the bug. The issue is in the `iter_modules_and_files` function where `path.resolve()` encounters embedded null bytes in filesystem paths, particularly when dealing with symlinks or special filesystem conditions like network mounts.\n\nThe current code only catches `FileNotFoundError` but doesn't handle `ValueError` for embedded null bytes, causing the entire autoreload system to crash intermittently.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 140,\n            \"end_line\": 146\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe fix involves expanding the exception handling in the `iter_modules_and_files` function to catch `ValueError` (which includes the \"embedded null byte\" error) in addition to `FileNotFoundError`, allowing the system to skip problematic paths gracefully instead of crashing.\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context. The problem statement confirms my analysis:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: The `ValueError: embedded null byte` occurs when pathlib's `resolve()` method encounters filesystem paths with embedded null bytes, particularly around `/Users` directory which likely has network mounts or special symlinks.\n\n2. **Stack Trace Analysis**: The error occurs at line 132 in `iter_modules_and_files` where `path.resolve().absolute()` is called, but in the current code I examined, this logic is now at lines 140-146 with slightly different implementation.\n\n3. **Current Implementation**: The code now uses `path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()` and has a try-catch for `FileNotFoundError` but doesn't handle `ValueError` for embedded null bytes.\n\n4. **Intermittent Nature**: The issue is intermittent because it depends on filesystem state - network mounts, symlink resolution, and timing of when certain paths are accessed.\n\nThe fix is clear: expand the exception handling to catch `ValueError` in addition to `FileNotFoundError` and skip problematic paths gracefully.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Lines 140-146 in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py`**: Expand the exception handling in the `iter_modules_and_files` function to catch `ValueError` (which includes \"embedded null byte\" errors) in addition to `FileNotFoundError`. This allows the autoreload system to skip problematic filesystem paths gracefully instead of crashing. The fix should change the except clause from `except FileNotFoundError:` to `except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError):` and update the comment to reflect that it also handles filesystem paths with embedded null bytes or other path resolution issues.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py lines 140-146\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        try:\n            resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            # The module could have been removed, don't fail loudly if this\n            # is the case.\n            continue\n        results.add(resolved_path)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\nAssistant: Looking at the code segment and the problem description, I can see that the current implementation has the right structure but needs to be expanded to handle the specific `ValueError: embedded null byte` issue described in the problem statement.\n\nThe current code:\n```python\ntry:\n    resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    # The module could have been removed, don't fail loudly if this\n    # is the case.\n    continue\n```\n\nThis only catches `FileNotFoundError`, but the stack trace clearly shows a `ValueError: embedded null byte` being thrown from `path.resolve()`. The issue occurs when pathlib encounters filesystem paths with embedded null bytes, particularly when dealing with symlinks or network mounts (as mentioned in the problem description about potential samba shares).\n\nThe fix is straightforward and aligns perfectly with the suggestion: expand the exception handling to catch `ValueError` in addition to `FileNotFoundError`, allowing the autoreload system to skip problematic paths gracefully instead of crashing.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\nUser: [Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py lines 140-146\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import functools\n  import itertools\n  import logging\n  import os\n  import signal\n  import subprocess\n  import sys\n  import threading\n  import time\n  import traceback\n  import weakref\n  from collections import defaultdict\n  from pathlib import Path\n  from types import ModuleType\n  from zipimport import zipimporter\n  from django.apps import apps\n  from django.core.signals import request_finished\n  from django.dispatch import Signal\n  from django.utils.functional import cached_property\n  from django.utils.version import get_version_tuple\n  import termios\n  import pywatchman\n  import django.__main__\n  from django.urls import get_resolver\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  130:         # this is the case, skip them.\n[C]  131:         if spec.has_location:\n[C]  132:             origin = spec.loader.archive if isinstance(spec.loader, zipimporter) else spec.origin\n[C]  133:             sys_file_paths.append(origin)\n[C]  134: \n[C]  135:     results = set()\n[C]  136:     for filename in itertools.chain(sys_file_paths, extra_files):\n[C]  137:         if not filename:\n[C]  138:             continue\n[C]  139:         path = Path(filename)\n[R]  140:         try:\n[R]  141:             resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()\n[R]  142:         except FileNotFoundError:\n[R]  143:             # The module could have been removed, don't fail loudly if this\n[R]  144:             # is the case.\n[R]  145:             continue\n[R]  146:         results.add(resolved_path)\n[C]  147:     return frozenset(results)\n[C]  148: \n[C]  149: \n[C]  150: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n[C]  151: def common_roots(paths):\n[C]  152:     \"\"\"\n[C]  153:     Return a tuple of common roots that are shared between the given paths.\n[C]  154:     File system watchers operate on directories and aren't cheap to create.\n[C]  155:     Try to find the minimum set of directories to watch that encompass all of\n[C]  156:     the files that need to be watched.\n\nYou must pay close attention to **indentation** — especially the relative indentation level between the patch and its parent scope (for example, the containing class or function).\n⚠️ **Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n⚠️ **Do not combine fixes for different locations into one block** — every location's fix should be in a **separate** ```python```code block.\n\nHere are the suggestions from the Suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context.

This allows the autoreload system to skip problematic filesystem paths gracefully instead of crashing. The fix should change the except clause from `except FileNotFoundError:` to `except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError):` and update the comment to reflect that it also handles filesystem paths with embedded null bytes or other path resolution issues.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py lines 140-146\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        try:\n            resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            # The module could have been removed, don't fail loudly if this\n            # is the case.\n            continue\n        results.add(resolved_path)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nLooking at the code segment and the problem description, I can see that the current implementation has the right structure but needs to be expanded to handle the specific `ValueError: embedded null byte` issue described in the problem statement.\n\nThe current code:\n```python\ntry:\n    resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    # The module could have been removed, don't fail loudly if this\n    # is the case.\n    continue\n```\n\nThis only catches `FileNotFoundError`, but the stack trace clearly shows a `ValueError: embedded null byte` being thrown from `path.resolve()`. The issue occurs when pathlib encounters filesystem paths with embedded null bytes, particularly when dealing with symlinks or network mounts (as mentioned in the problem description about potential samba shares).\n\nThe fix is straightforward and aligns perfectly with the suggestion: expand the exception handling to catch `ValueError` in addition to `FileNotFoundError`, allowing the autoreload system to skip problematic paths gracefully instead of crashing.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/utils/autoreload.py lines 140-146\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import functools\n  import itertools\n  import logging\n  import os\n  import signal\n  import subprocess\n  import sys\n  import threading\n  import time\n  import traceback\n  import weakref\n  from collections import defaultdict\n  from pathlib import Path\n  from types import ModuleType\n  from zipimport import zipimporter\n  from django.apps import apps\n  from django.core.signals import request_finished\n  from django.dispatch import Signal\n  from django.utils.functional import cached_property\n  from django.utils.version import get_version_tuple\n  import termios\n  import pywatchman\n  import django.__main__\n  from django.urls import get_resolver\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  130:         # this is the case, skip them.\n[C]  131:         if spec.has_location:\n[C]  132:             origin = spec.loader.archive if isinstance(spec.loader, zipimporter) else spec.origin\n[C]  133:             sys_file_paths.append(origin)\n[C]  134: \n[C]  135:     results = set()\n[C]  136:     for filename in itertools.chain(sys_file_paths, extra_files):\n[C]  137:         if not filename:\n[C]  138:             continue\n[C]  139:         path = Path(filename)\n[R]  140:         try:\n[R]  141:             resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()\n[R]  142:         except FileNotFoundError:\n[R]  143:             # The module could have been removed, don't fail loudly if this\n[R]  144:             # is the case.\n[R]  145:             continue\n[R]  146:         results.add(resolved_path)\n[C]  147:     return frozenset(results)\n[C]  148: \n[C]  149: \n[C]  150: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)\n[C]  151: def common_roots(paths):\n[C]  152:     \"\"\"\n[C]  153:     Return a tuple of common roots that are shared between the given paths.\n[C]  154:     File system watchers operate on directories and aren't cheap to create.\n[C]  155:     Try to find the minimum set of directories to watch that encompass all of\n[C]  156:     the files that need to be watched.\n\nYou must pay close attention to **indentation** — especially the relative indentation level between the patch and its parent scope (for example, the containing class or function).\n⚠️ **Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n⚠️ **Do not combine fixes for different locations into one block** — every location's fix should be in a **separate** ```python```code block.\n\nHere are the suggestions from the Suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context.
