What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

This violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\n## Key Findings from Code Exploration\n\n### Current MigrationRecorder Implementation\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70): Creates the migrations table without router checks\n  - `record_applied()` (lines 84-87): Records applied migrations without router checks\n  - `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92): Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n  - `applied_migrations()` (lines 72-82): Queries migrations without router checks\n  - `flush()` (lines 94-96): Deletes migration records without router checks\n\n### Django Router Pattern Analysis\nFrom examining other Django components, the standard pattern is:\n- Use `router.allow_migrate_model(db_alias, model)` to check if a model can be migrated\n- Use `router.allow_migrate(db_alias, app_label, **hints)` for general migration checks\n- Router utilities are available in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py`\n\n## Required Fix Strategy\nThe `MigrationRecorder` needs to be modified to:\n\n1. **Import the router**: Add `from django.db import router` \n2. **Check permissions before operations**: Add router checks in all methods that interact with the database\n3. **Handle router denials gracefully**: Return appropriate responses when router denies access\n\n## Specific Methods Requiring Modification\n1. `ensure_schema()` - Check before creating the migrations table\n2. `record_applied()` - Check before recording applied migrations\n3. `record_unapplied()` - Check before recording unapplied migrations  \n4. `applied_migrations()` - Check before querying migrations\n5. `flush()` - Check before deleting migration records\n6. `has_table()` - Potentially check before table introspection\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n- The Migration model is dynamically created with `app_label = 'migrations'`\n- Database alias is available via `self.connection.alias`\n- Router checks should use the pattern: `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)`\n\n## Current Status\n- **Completed**: Project structure exploration and bug identification\n- **Completed**: Analysis of current MigrationRecorder implementation\n- **Completed**: Research of Django's router patterns and conventions\n- **Next Steps**: Implement the router checks in MigrationRecorder methods and test the fix\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Mapped Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined MigrationRecorder source code\n- `search_code_with_context`: Found router usage patterns across Django codebase\n\nThe bug is clearly identified and the solution approach is well-defined. The next step is to implement the router checks in the MigrationRecorder class methods.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me look at the db router module to understand how allow_migrate should be used:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"router.allow_migrate\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'router.allow_migrate' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py\nLines 272-278:\n 272:     def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, **hints):\n 273:         for router in self.routers:\n 274:             try:\n 275:                 method = router.allow_migrate\n 276:             except AttributeError:\n 277:                 # If the router doesn't have a method, skip to the next one.\n 278:                 continue\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nLines 125-131:\n 125:                     for model in app_config.get_models():\n 126:                         if (\n 127:                             model._meta.can_migrate(self.connection) and\n 128:                             router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, model)\n 129:                         ):\n 130:                             queryset = model._base_manager.using(\n 131:                                 self.connection.alias,\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/executor.py\nLines 299-305:\n 299:             \"\"\"\n 300:             return (\n 301:                 model._meta.proxy or not model._meta.managed or not\n 302:                 router.allow_migrate(\n 303:                     self.connection.alias, migration.app_label,\n 304:                     model_name=model._meta.model_name,\n 305:                 )\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 101-107:\n 101:             state_operation.state_forwards(app_label, state)\n 102: \n 103:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 104:         if router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **self.hints):\n 105:             self._run_sql(schema_editor, self.sql)\n 106: \n 107:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 107-113:\n 107:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 108:         if self.reverse_sql is None:\n 109:             raise NotImplementedError(\"You cannot reverse this operation\")\n 110:         if router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **self.hints):\n 111:             self._run_sql(schema_editor, self.reverse_sql)\n 112: \n 113:     def describe(self):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 182-188:\n 182:         # RunPython has access to all models.

The next step is to implement the router checks in the MigrationRecorder class methods.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me look at the db router module to understand how allow_migrate should be used:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"router.allow_migrate\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'router.allow_migrate' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py\nLines 272-278:\n 272:     def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, **hints):\n 273:         for router in self.routers:\n 274:             try:\n 275:                 method = router.allow_migrate\n 276:             except AttributeError:\n 277:                 # If the router doesn't have a method, skip to the next one.\n 278:                 continue\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nLines 125-131:\n 125:                     for model in app_config.get_models():\n 126:                         if (\n 127:                             model._meta.can_migrate(self.connection) and\n 128:                             router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, model)\n 129:                         ):\n 130:                             queryset = model._base_manager.using(\n 131:                                 self.connection.alias,\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/executor.py\nLines 299-305:\n 299:             \"\"\"\n 300:             return (\n 301:                 model._meta.proxy or not model._meta.managed or not\n 302:                 router.allow_migrate(\n 303:                     self.connection.alias, migration.app_label,\n 304:                     model_name=model._meta.model_name,\n 305:                 )\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 101-107:\n 101:             state_operation.state_forwards(app_label, state)\n 102: \n 103:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 104:         if router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **self.hints):\n 105:             self._run_sql(schema_editor, self.sql)\n 106: \n 107:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 107-113:\n 107:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 108:         if self.reverse_sql is None:\n 109:             raise NotImplementedError(\"You cannot reverse this operation\")\n 110:         if router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **self.hints):\n 111:             self._run_sql(schema_editor, self.reverse_sql)\n 112: \n 113:     def describe(self):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 182-188:\n 182:         # RunPython has access to all models.

This causes Django to create migration tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids migrations.\n\n**Root Cause**: The MigrationRecorder methods (`ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`, `flush()`) perform database operations without checking `router.allow_migrate_model()` or `router.allow_migrate()`.\n\n**Key Technical Details**:\n1. From the router utils analysis, I see that `router.allow_migrate_model(db, model)` is the correct method to check if a model can be migrated to a specific database\n2. The pattern used throughout Django is to check `router.allow_migrate_model(connection.alias, model)` before performing database operations\n3. The MigrationRecorder has a dynamically created Migration model with `app_label = 'migrations'`\n\n**Locations to Fix**: I need to examine the specific methods in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` to identify the exact line ranges where router checks should be added.\n\nLet me now examine the current MigrationRecorder implementation to identify the precise locations that need modification.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from django.apps.registry import Apps\n   2: from django.db import DatabaseError, models\n   3: from django.utils.functional import classproperty\n   4: from django.utils.timezone import now\n   5: \n   6: from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n   7: \n   8: \n   9: class MigrationRecorder:\n  10:     \"\"\"\n  11:     Deal with storing migration records in the database.\n  12: \n  13:     Because this table is actually itself used for dealing with model\n  14:     creation, it's the one thing we can't do normally via migrations.\n  15:     We manually handle table creation/schema updating (using schema backend)\n  16:     and then have a floating model to do queries with.\n  17: \n  18:     If a migration is unapplied its row is removed from the table.

What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",
    "response": "Based on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I can now identify the precise locations where the bug exists. The MigrationRecorder class performs database operations without checking database router `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\nThe MigrationRecorder class has several methods that interact with the `django_migrations` table without respecting the database router's `allow_migrate` rules. According to the problem description, when a router returns `False` for `allow_migrate()`, Django should not create or modify the migrations table on that database connection.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe class lacks router permission checks before performing database operations. The router should be consulted using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` before any database operations.\n\n**Vulnerable Locations:**\n\n1. **Lines 59-70** (`ensure_schema` method): Creates the migrations table without checking if the router allows migrations on this database connection.\n\n2. **Lines 84-87** (`record_applied` method): Records applied migrations without router permission checks.\n\n3. **Lines 89-92** (`record_unapplied` method): Records unapplied migrations without router permission checks.\n\n4. **Lines 72-82** (`applied_migrations` method): Queries the migrations table without checking router permissions.\n\n5. **Lines 94-96** (`flush` method): Deletes migration records without router permission checks.\n\n**Required Fix:**\nThe class needs to import the router (`from django.db import router`) and add router checks using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` before performing any database operations. When the router denies access, methods should return appropriate default values or skip operations gracefully.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**",

This violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\n## Key Findings from Code Exploration\n\n### Current MigrationRecorder Implementation\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70): Creates the migrations table without router checks\n  - `record_applied()` (lines 84-87): Records applied migrations without router checks\n  - `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92): Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n  - `applied_migrations()` (lines 72-82): Queries migrations without router checks\n  - `flush()` (lines 94-96): Deletes migration records without router checks\n\n### Django Router Pattern Analysis\nFrom examining other Django components, the standard pattern is:\n- Use `router.allow_migrate_model(db_alias, model)` to check if a model can be migrated\n- Use `router.allow_migrate(db_alias, app_label, **hints)` for general migration checks\n- Router utilities are available in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py`\n\n## Required Fix Strategy\nThe `MigrationRecorder` needs to be modified to:\n\n1. **Import the router**: Add `from django.db import router` \n2. **Check permissions before operations**: Add router checks in all methods that interact with the database\n3. **Handle router denials gracefully**: Return appropriate responses when router denies access\n\n## Specific Methods Requiring Modification\n1. `ensure_schema()` - Check before creating the migrations table\n2. `record_applied()` - Check before recording applied migrations\n3. `record_unapplied()` - Check before recording unapplied migrations  \n4. `applied_migrations()` - Check before querying migrations\n5. `flush()` - Check before deleting migration records\n6. `has_table()` - Potentially check before table introspection\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n- The Migration model is dynamically created with `app_label = 'migrations'`\n- Database alias is available via `self.connection.alias`\n- Router checks should use the pattern: `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)`\n\n## Current Status\n- **Completed**: Project structure exploration and bug identification\n- **Completed**: Analysis of current MigrationRecorder implementation\n- **Completed**: Research of Django's router patterns and conventions\n- **Next Steps**: Implement the router checks in MigrationRecorder methods and test the fix\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Mapped Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined MigrationRecorder source code\n- `search_code_with_context`: Found router usage patterns across Django codebase\n\nThe bug is clearly identified and the solution approach is well-defined. The next step is to implement the router checks in the MigrationRecorder class methods.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me look at the db router module to understand how allow_migrate should be used:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"router.allow_migrate\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'router.allow_migrate' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py\nLines 272-278:\n 272:     def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, **hints):\n 273:         for router in self.routers:\n 274:             try:\n 275:                 method = router.allow_migrate\n 276:             except AttributeError:\n 277:                 # If the router doesn't have a method, skip to the next one.\n 278:                 continue\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nLines 125-131:\n 125:                     for model in app_config.get_models():\n 126:                         if (\n 127:                             model._meta.can_migrate(self.connection) and\n 128:                             router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, model)\n 129:                         ):\n 130:                             queryset = model._base_manager.using(\n 131:                                 self.connection.alias,\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/executor.py\nLines 299-305:\n 299:             \"\"\"\n 300:             return (\n 301:                 model._meta.proxy or not model._meta.managed or not\n 302:                 router.allow_migrate(\n 303:                     self.connection.alias, migration.app_label,\n 304:                     model_name=model._meta.model_name,\n 305:                 )\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 101-107:\n 101:             state_operation.state_forwards(app_label, state)\n 102: \n 103:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 104:         if router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **self.hints):\n 105:             self._run_sql(schema_editor, self.sql)\n 106: \n 107:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 107-113:\n 107:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 108:         if self.reverse_sql is None:\n 109:             raise NotImplementedError(\"You cannot reverse this operation\")\n 110:         if router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **self.hints):\n 111:             self._run_sql(schema_editor, self.reverse_sql)\n 112: \n 113:     def describe(self):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 182-188:\n 182:         # RunPython has access to all models.

This causes Django to create migration tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids migrations.\n\n**Root Cause**: The MigrationRecorder methods (`ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`, `flush()`) perform database operations without checking `router.allow_migrate_model()` or `router.allow_migrate()`.\n\n**Key Technical Details**:\n1. From the router utils analysis, I see that `router.allow_migrate_model(db, model)` is the correct method to check if a model can be migrated to a specific database\n2. The pattern used throughout Django is to check `router.allow_migrate_model(connection.alias, model)` before performing database operations\n3. The MigrationRecorder has a dynamically created Migration model with `app_label = 'migrations'`\n\n**Locations to Fix**: I need to examine the specific methods in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` to identify the exact line ranges where router checks should be added.\n\nLet me now examine the current MigrationRecorder implementation to identify the precise locations that need modification.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from django.apps.registry import Apps\n   2: from django.db import DatabaseError, models\n   3: from django.utils.functional import classproperty\n   4: from django.utils.timezone import now\n   5: \n   6: from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n   7: \n   8: \n   9: class MigrationRecorder:\n  10:     \"\"\"\n  11:     Deal with storing migration records in the database.\n  12: \n  13:     Because this table is actually itself used for dealing with model\n  14:     creation, it's the one thing we can't do normally via migrations.\n  15:     We manually handle table creation/schema updating (using schema backend)\n  16:     and then have a floating model to do queries with.\n  17: \n  18:     If a migration is unapplied its row is removed from the table.

The MigrationRecorder class performs database operations without checking database router `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\nThe MigrationRecorder class has several methods that interact with the `django_migrations` table without respecting the database router's `allow_migrate` rules. According to the problem description, when a router returns `False` for `allow_migrate()`, Django should not create or modify the migrations table on that database connection.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe class lacks router permission checks before performing database operations. The router should be consulted using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` before any database operations.\n\n**Vulnerable Locations:**\n\n1. **Lines 59-70** (`ensure_schema` method): Creates the migrations table without checking if the router allows migrations on this database connection.\n\n2. **Lines 84-87** (`record_applied` method): Records applied migrations without router permission checks.\n\n3. **Lines 89-92** (`record_unapplied` method): Records unapplied migrations without router permission checks.\n\n4. **Lines 72-82** (`applied_migrations` method): Queries the migrations table without checking router permissions.\n\n5. **Lines 94-96** (`flush` method): Deletes migration records without router permission checks.\n\n**Required Fix:**\nThe class needs to import the router (`from django.db import router`) and add router checks using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` before performing any database operations. When the router denies access, methods should return appropriate default values or skip operations gracefully.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django MigrationRecorder Bug Fix Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nFix a bug in Django's `MigrationRecorder` class where it doesn't respect database router `allow_migrate` rules when creating, querying, or modifying the `django_migrations` table.\n\n## Problem Analysis\nThe `MigrationRecorder` class in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` performs database operations on the `django_migrations` table without checking if the database router allows migrations for this model. This violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\n## Key Findings from Code Exploration\n\n### Current MigrationRecorder Implementation\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70): Creates the migrations table without router checks\n  - `record_applied()` (lines 84-87): Records applied migrations without router checks\n  - `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92): Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n  - `applied_migrations()` (lines 72-82): Queries migrations without router checks\n  - `flush()` (lines 94-96): Deletes migration records without router checks\n\n### Django Router Pattern Analysis\nFrom examining other Django components, the standard pattern is:\n- Use `router.allow_migrate_model(db_alias, model)` to check if a model can be migrated\n- Use `router.allow_migrate(db_alias, app_label, **hints)` for general migration checks\n- Router utilities are available in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py`\n\n## Required Fix Strategy\nThe `MigrationRecorder` needs to be modified to:\n\n1. **Import the router**: Add `from django.db import router` \n2. **Check permissions before operations**: Add router checks in all methods that interact with the database\n3. **Handle router denials gracefully**: Return appropriate responses when router denies access\n\n## Specific Methods Requiring Modification\n1. `ensure_schema()` - Check before creating the migrations table\n2. `record_applied()` - Check before recording applied migrations\n3. `record_unapplied()` - Check before recording unapplied migrations  \n4. `applied_migrations()` - Check before querying migrations\n5. `flush()` - Check before deleting migration records\n6. `has_table()` - Potentially check before table introspection\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n- The Migration model is dynamically created with `app_label = 'migrations'`\n- Database alias is available via `self.connection.alias`\n- Router checks should use the pattern: `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)`\n\n## Current Status\n- **Completed**: Project structure exploration and bug identification\n- **Completed**: Analysis of current MigrationRecorder implementation\n- **Completed**: Research of Django's router patterns and conventions\n- **Next Steps**: Implement the router checks in MigrationRecorder methods and test the fix\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Mapped Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined MigrationRecorder source code\n- `search_code_with_context`: Found router usage patterns across Django codebase\n\nThe bug is clearly identified and the solution approach is well-defined. The next step is to implement the router checks in the MigrationRecorder class methods.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 59\nEnd line: 70\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 84\nEnd line: 87\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 89\nEnd line: 92\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 72\nEnd line: 82\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 94\nEnd line: 96\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me look at the db router module to understand how allow_migrate should be used:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"router.allow_migrate\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'router.allow_migrate' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py\nLines 272-278:\n 272:     def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, **hints):\n 273:         for router in self.routers:\n 274:             try:\n 275:                 method = router.allow_migrate\n 276:             except AttributeError:\n 277:                 # If the router doesn't have a method, skip to the next one.\n 278:                 continue\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nLines 125-131:\n 125:                     for model in app_config.get_models():\n 126:                         if (\n 127:                             model._meta.can_migrate(self.connection) and\n 128:                             router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, model)\n 129:                         ):\n 130:                             queryset = model._base_manager.using(\n 131:                                 self.connection.alias,\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/executor.py\nLines 299-305:\n 299:             \"\"\"\n 300:             return (\n 301:                 model._meta.proxy or not model._meta.managed or not\n 302:                 router.allow_migrate(\n 303:                     self.connection.alias, migration.app_label,\n 304:                     model_name=model._meta.model_name,\n 305:                 )\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 101-107:\n 101:             state_operation.state_forwards(app_label, state)\n 102: \n 103:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 104:         if router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **self.hints):\n 105:             self._run_sql(schema_editor, self.sql)\n 106: \n 107:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 107-113:\n 107:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 108:         if self.reverse_sql is None:\n 109:             raise NotImplementedError(\"You cannot reverse this operation\")\n 110:         if router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **self.hints):\n 111:             self._run_sql(schema_editor, self.reverse_sql)\n 112: \n 113:     def describe(self):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 182-188:\n 182:         # RunPython has access to all models.

This causes Django to create migration tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids migrations.\n\n**Root Cause**: The MigrationRecorder methods (`ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`, `flush()`) perform database operations without checking `router.allow_migrate_model()` or `router.allow_migrate()`.\n\n**Key Technical Details**:\n1. From the router utils analysis, I see that `router.allow_migrate_model(db, model)` is the correct method to check if a model can be migrated to a specific database\n2. The pattern used throughout Django is to check `router.allow_migrate_model(connection.alias, model)` before performing database operations\n3. The MigrationRecorder has a dynamically created Migration model with `app_label = 'migrations'`\n\n**Locations to Fix**: I need to examine the specific methods in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` to identify the exact line ranges where router checks should be added.\n\nLet me now examine the current MigrationRecorder implementation to identify the precise locations that need modification.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from django.apps.registry import Apps\n   2: from django.db import DatabaseError, models\n   3: from django.utils.functional import classproperty\n   4: from django.utils.timezone import now\n   5: \n   6: from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n   7: \n   8: \n   9: class MigrationRecorder:\n  10:     \"\"\"\n  11:     Deal with storing migration records in the database.\n  12: \n  13:     Because this table is actually itself used for dealing with model\n  14:     creation, it's the one thing we can't do normally via migrations.\n  15:     We manually handle table creation/schema updating (using schema backend)\n  16:     and then have a floating model to do queries with.\n  17: \n  18:     If a migration is unapplied its row is removed from the table.

The MigrationRecorder class performs database operations without checking database router `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\nThe MigrationRecorder class has several methods that interact with the `django_migrations` table without respecting the database router's `allow_migrate` rules. According to the problem description, when a router returns `False` for `allow_migrate()`, Django should not create or modify the migrations table on that database connection.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe class lacks router permission checks before performing database operations. The router should be consulted using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` before any database operations.\n\n**Vulnerable Locations:**\n\n1. **Lines 59-70** (`ensure_schema` method): Creates the migrations table without checking if the router allows migrations on this database connection.\n\n2. **Lines 84-87** (`record_applied` method): Records applied migrations without router permission checks.\n\n3. **Lines 89-92** (`record_unapplied` method): Records unapplied migrations without router permission checks.\n\n4. **Lines 72-82** (`applied_migrations` method): Queries the migrations table without checking router permissions.\n\n5. **Lines 94-96** (`flush` method): Deletes migration records without router permission checks.\n\n**Required Fix:**\nThe class needs to import the router (`from django.db import router`) and add router checks using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` before performing any database operations. When the router denies access, methods should return appropriate default values or skip operations gracefully.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the MigrationRecorder class and the problem description, I have identified the precise locations where the bug exists. The MigrationRecorder performs database operations without checking database router `allow_migrate` rules, which violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\nThe bug manifests in 5 key methods that interact with the `django_migrations` table without consulting the router:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 59,\n            \"end_line\": 70\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 84,\n            \"end_line\": 87\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 89,\n            \"end_line\": 92\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 72,\n            \"end_line\": 82\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 94,\n            \"end_line\": 96\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThese locations correspond to:\n1. `ensure_schema()` - Creates migrations table without router checks\n2. `record_applied()` - Records applied migrations without router checks  \n3. `record_unapplied()` - Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n4. `applied_migrations()` - Queries migrations without router checks\n5. `flush()` - Deletes migration records without router checks\n\nThe fix requires adding `from django.db import router` import and implementing `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` checks before database operations in each method.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django MigrationRecorder Bug Fix Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nFix a bug in Django's `MigrationRecorder` class where it doesn't respect database router `allow_migrate` rules when creating, querying, or modifying the `django_migrations` table.\n\n## Problem Analysis\nThe `MigrationRecorder` class in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` performs database operations on the `django_migrations` table without checking if the database router allows migrations for this model. This violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\n## Key Findings from Code Exploration\n\n### Current MigrationRecorder Implementation\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70): Creates the migrations table without router checks\n  - `record_applied()` (lines 84-87): Records applied migrations without router checks\n  - `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92): Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n  - `applied_migrations()` (lines 72-82): Queries migrations without router checks\n  - `flush()` (lines 94-96): Deletes migration records without router checks\n\n### Django Router Pattern Analysis\nFrom examining other Django components, the standard pattern is:\n- Use `router.allow_migrate_model(db_alias, model)` to check if a model can be migrated\n- Use `router.allow_migrate(db_alias, app_label, **hints)` for general migration checks\n- Router utilities are available in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py`\n\n## Required Fix Strategy\nThe `MigrationRecorder` needs to be modified to:\n\n1. **Import the router**: Add `from django.db import router` \n2. **Check permissions before operations**: Add router checks in all methods that interact with the database\n3. **Handle router denials gracefully**: Return appropriate responses when router denies access\n\n## Specific Methods Requiring Modification\n1. `ensure_schema()` - Check before creating the migrations table\n2. `record_applied()` - Check before recording applied migrations\n3. `record_unapplied()` - Check before recording unapplied migrations  \n4. `applied_migrations()` - Check before querying migrations\n5. `flush()` - Check before deleting migration records\n6. `has_table()` - Potentially check before table introspection\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n- The Migration model is dynamically created with `app_label = 'migrations'`\n- Database alias is available via `self.connection.alias`\n- Router checks should use the pattern: `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)`\n\n## Current Status\n- **Completed**: Project structure exploration and bug identification\n- **Completed**: Analysis of current MigrationRecorder implementation\n- **Completed**: Research of Django's router patterns and conventions\n- **Next Steps**: Implement the router checks in MigrationRecorder methods and test the fix\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Mapped Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined MigrationRecorder source code\n- `search_code_with_context`: Found router usage patterns across Django codebase\n\nThe bug is clearly identified and the solution approach is well-defined. The next step is to implement the router checks in the MigrationRecorder class methods.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 59\nEnd line: 70\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 84\nEnd line: 87\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 89\nEnd line: 92\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 72\nEnd line: 82\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 94\nEnd line: 96\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on the problem statement and code analysis, the MigrationRecorder class needs to respect database router `allow_migrate` rules before performing any database operations.

This causes Django to create migration tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids migrations.\n\n**Root Cause**: The MigrationRecorder methods (`ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`, `flush()`) perform database operations without checking `router.allow_migrate_model()` or `router.allow_migrate()`.\n\n**Key Technical Details**:\n1. From the router utils analysis, I see that `router.allow_migrate_model(db, model)` is the correct method to check if a model can be migrated to a specific database\n2. The pattern used throughout Django is to check `router.allow_migrate_model(connection.alias, model)` before performing database operations\n3. The MigrationRecorder has a dynamically created Migration model with `app_label = 'migrations'`\n\n**Locations to Fix**: I need to examine the specific methods in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` to identify the exact line ranges where router checks should be added.\n\nLet me now examine the current MigrationRecorder implementation to identify the precise locations that need modification.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from django.apps.registry import Apps\n   2: from django.db import DatabaseError, models\n   3: from django.utils.functional import classproperty\n   4: from django.utils.timezone import now\n   5: \n   6: from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n   7: \n   8: \n   9: class MigrationRecorder:\n  10:     \"\"\"\n  11:     Deal with storing migration records in the database.\n  12: \n  13:     Because this table is actually itself used for dealing with model\n  14:     creation, it's the one thing we can't do normally via migrations.\n  15:     We manually handle table creation/schema updating (using schema backend)\n  16:     and then have a floating model to do queries with.\n  17: \n  18:     If a migration is unapplied its row is removed from the table.

The MigrationRecorder class performs database operations without checking database router `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\nThe MigrationRecorder class has several methods that interact with the `django_migrations` table without respecting the database router's `allow_migrate` rules. According to the problem description, when a router returns `False` for `allow_migrate()`, Django should not create or modify the migrations table on that database connection.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe class lacks router permission checks before performing database operations. The router should be consulted using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` before any database operations.\n\n**Vulnerable Locations:**\n\n1. **Lines 59-70** (`ensure_schema` method): Creates the migrations table without checking if the router allows migrations on this database connection.\n\n2. **Lines 84-87** (`record_applied` method): Records applied migrations without router permission checks.\n\n3. **Lines 89-92** (`record_unapplied` method): Records unapplied migrations without router permission checks.\n\n4. **Lines 72-82** (`applied_migrations` method): Queries the migrations table without checking router permissions.\n\n5. **Lines 94-96** (`flush` method): Deletes migration records without router permission checks.\n\n**Required Fix:**\nThe class needs to import the router (`from django.db import router`) and add router checks using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` before performing any database operations. When the router denies access, methods should return appropriate default values or skip operations gracefully.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the MigrationRecorder class and the problem description, I have identified the precise locations where the bug exists. The MigrationRecorder performs database operations without checking database router `allow_migrate` rules, which violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\nThe bug manifests in 5 key methods that interact with the `django_migrations` table without consulting the router:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 59,\n            \"end_line\": 70\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 84,\n            \"end_line\": 87\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 89,\n            \"end_line\": 92\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 72,\n            \"end_line\": 82\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 94,\n            \"end_line\": 96\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThese locations correspond to:\n1. `ensure_schema()` - Creates migrations table without router checks\n2. `record_applied()` - Records applied migrations without router checks  \n3. `record_unapplied()` - Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n4. `applied_migrations()` - Queries migrations without router checks\n5. `flush()` - Deletes migration records without router checks\n\nThe fix requires adding `from django.db import router` import and implementing `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` checks before database operations in each method.\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and code analysis, the MigrationRecorder class needs to respect database router `allow_migrate` rules before performing any database operations. The router should be consulted using `router.allow_migrate_model()` to determine if the migrations table can be created or modified on a specific database connection.\n\n1. **[Lines 59-70 - ensure_schema method]**: Add router check before creating the migrations table. If the router denies migration access, the method should return early without creating the table. This prevents the core issue where Django creates migration tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids migrations.\n\n2. **[Lines 84-87 - record_applied method]**: Add router check before recording applied migrations. If the router denies access, the method should return early without calling `ensure_schema()` or creating migration records. This depends on the router check in ensure_schema (location 1) to prevent table creation.\n\n3. **[Lines 89-92 - record_unapplied method]**: Add router check before recording unapplied migrations. If the router denies access, the method should return early without calling `ensure_schema()` or deleting migration records. This works in coordination with locations 1 and 2 to maintain consistency.\n\n4. **[Lines 72-82 - applied_migrations method]**: Add router check before querying migrations. If the router denies access, return an empty dictionary `{}` to indicate no applied migrations, which is the expected behavior when migrations are not allowed on that database connection. This supports the other methods by providing consistent behavior.\n\n5. **[Lines 94-96 - flush method]**: Add router check before deleting migration records. If the router denies access, the method should return early without performing any deletion operations. This completes the protection by ensuring no migration-related database operations occur when the router forbids them.\n\n**Implementation Pattern**: All methods should import `from django.db import router` and use `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` to check permissions. When access is denied, methods should fail gracefully by returning appropriate default values or skipping operations entirely.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 59-70\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def ensure_schema(self):\n        \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n        # If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema\n        # in the codebase.\n        if self.has_table():\n            return\n        # Make the table\n        try:\n            with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n                editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n        except DatabaseError as exc:\n            raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 84-87\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def record_applied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was applied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 89-92\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def record_unapplied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was unapplied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 72-82\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def applied_migrations(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return a dict mapping (app_name, migration_name) to Migration instances\n        for all applied migrations.\n        \"\"\"\n        if self.has_table():\n            return {(migration.app, migration.name): migration for migration in self.migration_qs}\n        else:\n            # If the django_migrations table doesn't exist, then no migrations\n            # are applied.\n            return {}\n\n\n[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 94-96\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def flush(self):\n        \"\"\"Delete all migration records.

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",
    "response": "Looking at the code segments and the problem statement, I can see that these locations are indeed the correct places where the bug manifests.

This directly violates the router's `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n2. **Location 2 (record_applied)**: Calls `ensure_schema()` and creates migration records without router checks, which can trigger table creation on forbidden databases.\n\n3. **Location 3 (record_unapplied)**: Similar to Location 2, calls `ensure_schema()` and performs delete operations without router permission checks.\n\n4. **Location 4 (applied_migrations)**: Queries the migrations table without checking if the router allows migrations on this database connection.\n\n5. **Location 5 (flush)**: Deletes migration records without router permission checks.\n\n**Required Fix Pattern**: \n- Import `from django.db import router` \n- Add `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` checks before database operations\n- Return appropriate defaults when router denies access (empty dict for queries, early return for operations)\n\n**Interconnection**: These methods work together - `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` both call `ensure_schema`, so fixing `ensure_schema` will prevent table creation, while the other methods need individual router checks to prevent unauthorized queries and operations.\n\nThe locations are clearly identified and the fix approach is well-defined based on Django's router patterns found in the codebase.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**",

This violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\n## Key Findings from Code Exploration\n\n### Current MigrationRecorder Implementation\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70): Creates the migrations table without router checks\n  - `record_applied()` (lines 84-87): Records applied migrations without router checks\n  - `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92): Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n  - `applied_migrations()` (lines 72-82): Queries migrations without router checks\n  - `flush()` (lines 94-96): Deletes migration records without router checks\n\n### Django Router Pattern Analysis\nFrom examining other Django components, the standard pattern is:\n- Use `router.allow_migrate_model(db_alias, model)` to check if a model can be migrated\n- Use `router.allow_migrate(db_alias, app_label, **hints)` for general migration checks\n- Router utilities are available in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py`\n\n## Required Fix Strategy\nThe `MigrationRecorder` needs to be modified to:\n\n1. **Import the router**: Add `from django.db import router` \n2. **Check permissions before operations**: Add router checks in all methods that interact with the database\n3. **Handle router denials gracefully**: Return appropriate responses when router denies access\n\n## Specific Methods Requiring Modification\n1. `ensure_schema()` - Check before creating the migrations table\n2. `record_applied()` - Check before recording applied migrations\n3. `record_unapplied()` - Check before recording unapplied migrations  \n4. `applied_migrations()` - Check before querying migrations\n5. `flush()` - Check before deleting migration records\n6. `has_table()` - Potentially check before table introspection\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n- The Migration model is dynamically created with `app_label = 'migrations'`\n- Database alias is available via `self.connection.alias`\n- Router checks should use the pattern: `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)`\n\n## Current Status\n- **Completed**: Project structure exploration and bug identification\n- **Completed**: Analysis of current MigrationRecorder implementation\n- **Completed**: Research of Django's router patterns and conventions\n- **Next Steps**: Implement the router checks in MigrationRecorder methods and test the fix\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Mapped Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined MigrationRecorder source code\n- `search_code_with_context`: Found router usage patterns across Django codebase\n\nThe bug is clearly identified and the solution approach is well-defined.

When access is denied, methods should fail gracefully by returning appropriate default values or skipping operations entirely.\nNote that the Patch provided should be a direct substitution of the location code by the Locator.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me look at the db router module to understand how allow_migrate should be used:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"router.allow_migrate\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'router.allow_migrate' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py\nLines 272-278:\n 272:     def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, **hints):\n 273:         for router in self.routers:\n 274:             try:\n 275:                 method = router.allow_migrate\n 276:             except AttributeError:\n 277:                 # If the router doesn't have a method, skip to the next one.\n 278:                 continue\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nLines 125-131:\n 125:                     for model in app_config.get_models():\n 126:                         if (\n 127:                             model._meta.can_migrate(self.connection) and\n 128:                             router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, model)\n 129:                         ):\n 130:                             queryset = model._base_manager.using(\n 131:                                 self.connection.alias,\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/executor.py\nLines 299-305:\n 299:             \"\"\"\n 300:             return (\n 301:                 model._meta.proxy or not model._meta.managed or not\n 302:                 router.allow_migrate(\n 303:                     self.connection.alias, migration.app_label,\n 304:                     model_name=model._meta.model_name,\n 305:                 )\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 101-107:\n 101:             state_operation.state_forwards(app_label, state)\n 102: \n 103:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 104:         if router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **self.hints):\n 105:             self._run_sql(schema_editor, self.sql)\n 106: \n 107:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 107-113:\n 107:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 108:         if self.reverse_sql is None:\n 109:             raise NotImplementedError(\"You cannot reverse this operation\")\n 110:         if router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **self.hints):\n 111:             self._run_sql(schema_editor, self.reverse_sql)\n 112: \n 113:     def describe(self):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 182-188:\n 182:         # RunPython has access to all models.

This causes Django to create migration tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids migrations.\n\n**Root Cause**: The MigrationRecorder methods (`ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`, `flush()`) perform database operations without checking `router.allow_migrate_model()` or `router.allow_migrate()`.\n\n**Key Technical Details**:\n1. From the router utils analysis, I see that `router.allow_migrate_model(db, model)` is the correct method to check if a model can be migrated to a specific database\n2. The pattern used throughout Django is to check `router.allow_migrate_model(connection.alias, model)` before performing database operations\n3. The MigrationRecorder has a dynamically created Migration model with `app_label = 'migrations'`\n\n**Locations to Fix**: I need to examine the specific methods in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` to identify the exact line ranges where router checks should be added.\n\nLet me now examine the current MigrationRecorder implementation to identify the precise locations that need modification.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from django.apps.registry import Apps\n   2: from django.db import DatabaseError, models\n   3: from django.utils.functional import classproperty\n   4: from django.utils.timezone import now\n   5: \n   6: from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n   7: \n   8: \n   9: class MigrationRecorder:\n  10:     \"\"\"\n  11:     Deal with storing migration records in the database.\n  12: \n  13:     Because this table is actually itself used for dealing with model\n  14:     creation, it's the one thing we can't do normally via migrations.\n  15:     We manually handle table creation/schema updating (using schema backend)\n  16:     and then have a floating model to do queries with.\n  17: \n  18:     If a migration is unapplied its row is removed from the table.

The MigrationRecorder class performs database operations without checking database router `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\nThe MigrationRecorder class has several methods that interact with the `django_migrations` table without respecting the database router's `allow_migrate` rules. According to the problem description, when a router returns `False` for `allow_migrate()`, Django should not create or modify the migrations table on that database connection.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe class lacks router permission checks before performing database operations. The router should be consulted using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` before any database operations.\n\n**Vulnerable Locations:**\n\n1. **Lines 59-70** (`ensure_schema` method): Creates the migrations table without checking if the router allows migrations on this database connection.\n\n2. **Lines 84-87** (`record_applied` method): Records applied migrations without router permission checks.\n\n3. **Lines 89-92** (`record_unapplied` method): Records unapplied migrations without router permission checks.\n\n4. **Lines 72-82** (`applied_migrations` method): Queries the migrations table without checking router permissions.\n\n5. **Lines 94-96** (`flush` method): Deletes migration records without router permission checks.\n\n**Required Fix:**\nThe class needs to import the router (`from django.db import router`) and add router checks using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` before performing any database operations. When the router denies access, methods should return appropriate default values or skip operations gracefully.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the MigrationRecorder class and the problem description, I have identified the precise locations where the bug exists. The MigrationRecorder performs database operations without checking database router `allow_migrate` rules, which violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\nThe bug manifests in 5 key methods that interact with the `django_migrations` table without consulting the router:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 59,\n            \"end_line\": 70\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 84,\n            \"end_line\": 87\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 89,\n            \"end_line\": 92\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 72,\n            \"end_line\": 82\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 94,\n            \"end_line\": 96\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThese locations correspond to:\n1. `ensure_schema()` - Creates migrations table without router checks\n2. `record_applied()` - Records applied migrations without router checks  \n3. `record_unapplied()` - Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n4. `applied_migrations()` - Queries migrations without router checks\n5. `flush()` - Deletes migration records without router checks\n\nThe fix requires adding `from django.db import router` import and implementing `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` checks before database operations in each method.\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and code analysis, the MigrationRecorder class needs to respect database router `allow_migrate` rules before performing any database operations. The router should be consulted using `router.allow_migrate_model()` to determine if the migrations table can be created or modified on a specific database connection.\n\n1. **[Lines 59-70 - ensure_schema method]**: Add router check before creating the migrations table. If the router denies migration access, the method should return early without creating the table. This prevents the core issue where Django creates migration tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids migrations.\n\n2. **[Lines 84-87 - record_applied method]**: Add router check before recording applied migrations. If the router denies access, the method should return early without calling `ensure_schema()` or creating migration records. This depends on the router check in ensure_schema (location 1) to prevent table creation.\n\n3. **[Lines 89-92 - record_unapplied method]**: Add router check before recording unapplied migrations. If the router denies access, the method should return early without calling `ensure_schema()` or deleting migration records. This works in coordination with locations 1 and 2 to maintain consistency.\n\n4. **[Lines 72-82 - applied_migrations method]**: Add router check before querying migrations. If the router denies access, return an empty dictionary `{}` to indicate no applied migrations, which is the expected behavior when migrations are not allowed on that database connection. This supports the other methods by providing consistent behavior.\n\n5. **[Lines 94-96 - flush method]**: Add router check before deleting migration records. If the router denies access, the method should return early without performing any deletion operations. This completes the protection by ensuring no migration-related database operations occur when the router forbids them.\n\n**Implementation Pattern**: All methods should import `from django.db import router` and use `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` to check permissions.

The issue is clear:\n\n**Problem**: The MigrationRecorder methods perform database operations without checking if the database router allows migrations on the specific database connection. According to the problem statement, when a router returns `False` for `allow_migrate()`, Django should not create or modify the migrations table on that database connection.\n\n**Analysis of Each Location**:\n\n1. **Location 1 (ensure_schema)**: This is the core issue - it creates the migrations table without checking router permissions. This directly violates the router's `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n2. **Location 2 (record_applied)**: Calls `ensure_schema()` and creates migration records without router checks, which can trigger table creation on forbidden databases.\n\n3. **Location 3 (record_unapplied)**: Similar to Location 2, calls `ensure_schema()` and performs delete operations without router permission checks.\n\n4. **Location 4 (applied_migrations)**: Queries the migrations table without checking if the router allows migrations on this database connection.\n\n5. **Location 5 (flush)**: Deletes migration records without router permission checks.\n\n**Required Fix Pattern**: \n- Import `from django.db import router` \n- Add `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` checks before database operations\n- Return appropriate defaults when router denies access (empty dict for queries, early return for operations)\n\n**Interconnection**: These methods work together - `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` both call `ensure_schema`, so fixing `ensure_schema` will prevent table creation, while the other methods need individual router checks to prevent unauthorized queries and operations.\n\nThe locations are clearly identified and the fix approach is well-defined based on Django's router patterns found in the codebase.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 59-70\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  from django.apps.registry import Apps\n  from django.db import DatabaseError, models\n  from django.utils.functional import classproperty\n  from django.utils.timezone import now\n  from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   49:     @property\n[C]   50:     def migration_qs(self):\n[C]   51:         return self.Migration.objects.using(self.connection.alias)\n[C]   52: \n[C]   53:     def has_table(self):\n[C]   54:         \"\"\"Return True if the django_migrations table exists.\"\"\"\n[C]   55:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n[C]   56:             tables = self.connection.introspection.table_names(cursor)\n[C]   57:         return self.Migration._meta.db_table in tables\n[C]   58: \n[R]   59:     def ensure_schema(self):\n[R]   60:         \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n[R]   61:         # If the table's there, that's fine -

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 59-70\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def ensure_schema(self):\n        \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n        # If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema\n        # in the codebase.\n        if self.has_table():\n            return\n        # Make the table\n        try:\n            with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n                editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n        except DatabaseError as exc:\n            raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 84-87\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def record_applied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was applied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 89-92\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def record_unapplied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was unapplied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 72-82\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def applied_migrations(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return a dict mapping (app_name, migration_name) to Migration instances\n        for all applied migrations.\n        \"\"\"\n        if self.has_table():\n            return {(migration.app, migration.name): migration for migration in self.migration_qs}\n        else:\n            # If the django_migrations table doesn't exist, then no migrations\n            # are applied.\n            return {}\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 94-96\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def flush(self):\n        \"\"\"Delete all migration records.

This violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\n## Key Findings from Code Exploration\n\n### Current MigrationRecorder Implementation\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70): Creates the migrations table without router checks\n  - `record_applied()` (lines 84-87): Records applied migrations without router checks\n  - `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92): Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n  - `applied_migrations()` (lines 72-82): Queries migrations without router checks\n  - `flush()` (lines 94-96): Deletes migration records without router checks\n\n### Django Router Pattern Analysis\nFrom examining other Django components, the standard pattern is:\n- Use `router.allow_migrate_model(db_alias, model)` to check if a model can be migrated\n- Use `router.allow_migrate(db_alias, app_label, **hints)` for general migration checks\n- Router utilities are available in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py`\n\n## Required Fix Strategy\nThe `MigrationRecorder` needs to be modified to:\n\n1. **Import the router**: Add `from django.db import router` \n2. **Check permissions before operations**: Add router checks in all methods that interact with the database\n3. **Handle router denials gracefully**: Return appropriate responses when router denies access\n\n## Specific Methods Requiring Modification\n1. `ensure_schema()` - Check before creating the migrations table\n2. `record_applied()` - Check before recording applied migrations\n3. `record_unapplied()` - Check before recording unapplied migrations  \n4. `applied_migrations()` - Check before querying migrations\n5. `flush()` - Check before deleting migration records\n6. `has_table()` - Potentially check before table introspection\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n- The Migration model is dynamically created with `app_label = 'migrations'`\n- Database alias is available via `self.connection.alias`\n- Router checks should use the pattern: `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)`\n\n## Current Status\n- **Completed**: Project structure exploration and bug identification\n- **Completed**: Analysis of current MigrationRecorder implementation\n- **Completed**: Research of Django's router patterns and conventions\n- **Next Steps**: Implement the router checks in MigrationRecorder methods and test the fix\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Mapped Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined MigrationRecorder source code\n- `search_code_with_context`: Found router usage patterns across Django codebase\n\nThe bug is clearly identified and the solution approach is well-defined. The next step is to implement the router checks in the MigrationRecorder class methods.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: Now let me look at the db router module to understand how allow_migrate should be used:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"router.allow_migrate\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'router.allow_migrate' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py\nLines 272-278:\n 272:     def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, **hints):\n 273:         for router in self.routers:\n 274:             try:\n 275:                 method = router.allow_migrate\n 276:             except AttributeError:\n 277:                 # If the router doesn't have a method, skip to the next one.\n 278:                 continue\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nLines 125-131:\n 125:                     for model in app_config.get_models():\n 126:                         if (\n 127:                             model._meta.can_migrate(self.connection) and\n 128:                             router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, model)\n 129:                         ):\n 130:                             queryset = model._base_manager.using(\n 131:                                 self.connection.alias,\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/executor.py\nLines 299-305:\n 299:             \"\"\"\n 300:             return (\n 301:                 model._meta.proxy or not model._meta.managed or not\n 302:                 router.allow_migrate(\n 303:                     self.connection.alias, migration.app_label,\n 304:                     model_name=model._meta.model_name,\n 305:                 )\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 101-107:\n 101:             state_operation.state_forwards(app_label, state)\n 102: \n 103:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 104:         if router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **self.hints):\n 105:             self._run_sql(schema_editor, self.sql)\n 106: \n 107:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 107-113:\n 107:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 108:         if self.reverse_sql is None:\n 109:             raise NotImplementedError(\"You cannot reverse this operation\")\n 110:         if router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **self.hints):\n 111:             self._run_sql(schema_editor, self.reverse_sql)\n 112: \n 113:     def describe(self):\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py\nLines 182-188:\n 182:         # RunPython has access to all models.

This causes Django to create migration tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids migrations.\n\n**Root Cause**: The MigrationRecorder methods (`ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`, `flush()`) perform database operations without checking `router.allow_migrate_model()` or `router.allow_migrate()`.\n\n**Key Technical Details**:\n1. From the router utils analysis, I see that `router.allow_migrate_model(db, model)` is the correct method to check if a model can be migrated to a specific database\n2. The pattern used throughout Django is to check `router.allow_migrate_model(connection.alias, model)` before performing database operations\n3. The MigrationRecorder has a dynamically created Migration model with `app_label = 'migrations'`\n\n**Locations to Fix**: I need to examine the specific methods in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` to identify the exact line ranges where router checks should be added.\n\nLet me now examine the current MigrationRecorder implementation to identify the precise locations that need modification.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from django.apps.registry import Apps\n   2: from django.db import DatabaseError, models\n   3: from django.utils.functional import classproperty\n   4: from django.utils.timezone import now\n   5: \n   6: from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n   7: \n   8: \n   9: class MigrationRecorder:\n  10:     \"\"\"\n  11:     Deal with storing migration records in the database.\n  12: \n  13:     Because this table is actually itself used for dealing with model\n  14:     creation, it's the one thing we can't do normally via migrations.\n  15:     We manually handle table creation/schema updating (using schema backend)\n  16:     and then have a floating model to do queries with.\n  17: \n  18:     If a migration is unapplied its row is removed from the table.

The MigrationRecorder class performs database operations without checking database router `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\nThe MigrationRecorder class has several methods that interact with the `django_migrations` table without respecting the database router's `allow_migrate` rules. According to the problem description, when a router returns `False` for `allow_migrate()`, Django should not create or modify the migrations table on that database connection.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe class lacks router permission checks before performing database operations. The router should be consulted using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` before any database operations.\n\n**Vulnerable Locations:**\n\n1. **Lines 59-70** (`ensure_schema` method): Creates the migrations table without checking if the router allows migrations on this database connection.\n\n2. **Lines 84-87** (`record_applied` method): Records applied migrations without router permission checks.\n\n3. **Lines 89-92** (`record_unapplied` method): Records unapplied migrations without router permission checks.\n\n4. **Lines 72-82** (`applied_migrations` method): Queries the migrations table without checking router permissions.\n\n5. **Lines 94-96** (`flush` method): Deletes migration records without router permission checks.\n\n**Required Fix:**\nThe class needs to import the router (`from django.db import router`) and add router checks using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` before performing any database operations. When the router denies access, methods should return appropriate default values or skip operations gracefully.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the MigrationRecorder class and the problem description, I have identified the precise locations where the bug exists. The MigrationRecorder performs database operations without checking database router `allow_migrate` rules, which violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\nThe bug manifests in 5 key methods that interact with the `django_migrations` table without consulting the router:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 59,\n            \"end_line\": 70\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 84,\n            \"end_line\": 87\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 89,\n            \"end_line\": 92\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 72,\n            \"end_line\": 82\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 94,\n            \"end_line\": 96\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThese locations correspond to:\n1. `ensure_schema()` - Creates migrations table without router checks\n2. `record_applied()` - Records applied migrations without router checks  \n3. `record_unapplied()` - Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n4. `applied_migrations()` - Queries migrations without router checks\n5. `flush()` - Deletes migration records without router checks\n\nThe fix requires adding `from django.db import router` import and implementing `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` checks before database operations in each method.\nAssistant: PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and code analysis, the MigrationRecorder class needs to respect database router `allow_migrate` rules before performing any database operations. The router should be consulted using `router.allow_migrate_model()` to determine if the migrations table can be created or modified on a specific database connection.\n\n1. **[Lines 59-70 - ensure_schema method]**: Add router check before creating the migrations table. If the router denies migration access, the method should return early without creating the table. This prevents the core issue where Django creates migration tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids migrations.\n\n2. **[Lines 84-87 - record_applied method]**: Add router check before recording applied migrations. If the router denies access, the method should return early without calling `ensure_schema()` or creating migration records. This depends on the router check in ensure_schema (location 1) to prevent table creation.\n\n3. **[Lines 89-92 - record_unapplied method]**: Add router check before recording unapplied migrations. If the router denies access, the method should return early without calling `ensure_schema()` or deleting migration records. This works in coordination with locations 1 and 2 to maintain consistency.\n\n4. **[Lines 72-82 - applied_migrations method]**: Add router check before querying migrations. If the router denies access, return an empty dictionary `{}` to indicate no applied migrations, which is the expected behavior when migrations are not allowed on that database connection.

The issue is clear:\n\n**Problem**: The MigrationRecorder methods perform database operations without checking if the database router allows migrations on the specific database connection. According to the problem statement, when a router returns `False` for `allow_migrate()`, Django should not create or modify the migrations table on that database connection.\n\n**Analysis of Each Location**:\n\n1. **Location 1 (ensure_schema)**: This is the core issue - it creates the migrations table without checking router permissions. This directly violates the router's `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n2. **Location 2 (record_applied)**: Calls `ensure_schema()` and creates migration records without router checks, which can trigger table creation on forbidden databases.\n\n3. **Location 3 (record_unapplied)**: Similar to Location 2, calls `ensure_schema()` and performs delete operations without router permission checks.\n\n4. **Location 4 (applied_migrations)**: Queries the migrations table without checking if the router allows migrations on this database connection.\n\n5. **Location 5 (flush)**: Deletes migration records without router permission checks.\n\n**Required Fix Pattern**: \n- Import `from django.db import router` \n- Add `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` checks before database operations\n- Return appropriate defaults when router denies access (empty dict for queries, early return for operations)\n\n**Interconnection**: These methods work together - `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` both call `ensure_schema`, so fixing `ensure_schema` will prevent table creation, while the other methods need individual router checks to prevent unauthorized queries and operations.\n\nThe locations are clearly identified and the fix approach is well-defined based on Django's router patterns found in the codebase.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\nUser: [Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 59-70\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  from django.apps.registry import Apps\n  from django.db import DatabaseError, models\n  from django.utils.functional import classproperty\n  from django.utils.timezone import now\n  from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   49:     @property\n[C]   50:     def migration_qs(self):\n[C]   51:         return self.Migration.objects.using(self.connection.alias)\n[C]   52: \n[C]   53:     def has_table(self):\n[C]   54:         \"\"\"Return True if the django_migrations table exists.\"\"\"\n[C]   55:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n[C]   56:             tables = self.connection.introspection.table_names(cursor)\n[C]   57:         return self.Migration._meta.db_table in tables\n[C]   58: \n[R]   59:     def ensure_schema(self):\n[R]   60:         \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n[R]   61:         # If the table's there, that's fine -

    "response": "# Django MigrationRecorder Bug Fix Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nFix a bug in Django's `MigrationRecorder` class where it doesn't respect database router `allow_migrate` rules when creating, querying, or modifying the `django_migrations` table.\n\n## Problem Analysis\nThe `MigrationRecorder` class in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` performs database operations on the `django_migrations` table without checking if the database router allows migrations for this model. This violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\n## Key Findings from Code Exploration\n\n### Current MigrationRecorder Implementation\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70): Creates the migrations table without router checks\n  - `record_applied()` (lines 84-87): Records applied migrations without router checks\n  - `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92): Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n  - `applied_migrations()` (lines 72-82): Queries migrations without router checks\n  - `flush()` (lines 94-96): Deletes migration records without router checks\n\n### Django Router Pattern Analysis\nFrom examining other Django components, the standard pattern is:\n- Use `router.allow_migrate_model(db_alias, model)` to check if a model can be migrated\n- Use `router.allow_migrate(db_alias, app_label, **hints)` for general migration checks\n- Router utilities are available in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py`\n\n## Detailed Technical Analysis\n\n### Router Implementation Details\n- `router.allow_migrate_model(db, model)` calls `router.allow_migrate(db, model._meta.app_label, model_name=model._meta.model_name, model=model)`\n- Returns `True` by default if no router explicitly denies access\n- Returns `False` when a router explicitly forbids migrations on that database\n\n### MigrationRecorder Structure\n- Migration model is dynamically created with `app_label = 'migrations'` and `db_table = 'django_migrations'`\n- Database alias is available via `self.connection.alias`\n- Current imports: `Apps`, `DatabaseError`, `models`, `classproperty`, `now`, `MigrationSchemaMissing`\n\n## Specific Bug Locations Identified\n\n### Location 1: ensure_schema() method (lines 59-70)\n**Current Code**: Creates migrations table without router permission checks\n**Issue**: Core problem - creates table on databases where router forbids migrations\n**Fix Required**: Add router check before table creation, return early if denied\n\n### Location 2: record_applied() method (lines 84-87)\n**Current Code**: Calls `ensure_schema()` and creates migration records without checks\n**Issue**: Can trigger unauthorized table creation and record insertion\n**Fix Required**: Add router check before operations, return early if denied\n\n### Location 3: record_unapplied() method (lines 89-92)\n**Current Code**: Calls `ensure_schema()` and deletes migration records without checks\n**Issue**: Can trigger unauthorized table creation and record deletion\n**Fix Required**: Add router check before operations, return early if denied\n\n### Location 4: applied_migrations() method (lines 72-82)\n**Current Code**: Queries migrations table without router permission checks\n**Issue**: Performs unauthorized database queries\n**Fix Required**: Add router check, return empty dict `{}` if denied\n\n### Location 5: flush() method (lines 94-96)\n**Current Code**: Deletes all migration records without router checks\n**Issue**: Performs unauthorized deletion operations\n**Fix Required**: Add router check before deletion, return early if denied\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Required Changes\n1. **Import Addition**: Add `from django.db import router` (note: `router` not in current imports)\n2. **Router Check Pattern**: Use `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)`\n3. **Graceful Handling**: Return appropriate defaults when router denies access\n\n### Method Interdependencies\n- `record_applied()` and `record_unapplied()` both call `ensure_schema()`\n- Fixing `ensure_schema()` prevents unauthorized table creation\n- Other methods need individual router checks for query/modification operations\n\n## Current Status\n- **Completed**: Project structure exploration and bug identification\n- **Completed**: Analysis of current MigrationRecorder implementation  \n- **Completed**: Research of Django's router patterns and conventions\n- **Completed**: Detailed code analysis of all vulnerable locations\n- **Completed**: Location identification and patch preparation\n- **In Progress**: Implementing router checks in MigrationRecorder methods\n\n## Next Steps\nReady to implement the router permission checks in all five identified locations using the pattern `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` with appropriate fallback behaviors for each method type.\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Mapped Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined MigrationRecorder source code and router utilities\n- `search_code_with_context`: Found router usage patterns across Django codebase\n\nThe bug is clearly identified with precise locations and the solution approach is well-defined. Implementation is ready to proceed.",

This violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\n## Key Findings from Code Exploration\n\n### Current MigrationRecorder Implementation\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70): Creates the migrations table without router checks\n  - `record_applied()` (lines 84-87): Records applied migrations without router checks\n  - `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92): Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n  - `applied_migrations()` (lines 72-82): Queries migrations without router checks\n  - `flush()` (lines 94-96): Deletes migration records without router checks\n\n### Django Router Pattern Analysis\nFrom examining other Django components, the standard pattern is:\n- Use `router.allow_migrate_model(db_alias, model)` to check if a model can be migrated\n- Use `router.allow_migrate(db_alias, app_label, **hints)` for general migration checks\n- Router utilities are available in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py`\n\n## Detailed Technical Analysis\n\n### Router Implementation Details\n- `router.allow_migrate_model(db, model)` calls `router.allow_migrate(db, model._meta.app_label, model_name=model._meta.model_name, model=model)`\n- Returns `True` by default if no router explicitly denies access\n- Returns `False` when a router explicitly forbids migrations on that database\n\n### MigrationRecorder Structure\n- Migration model is dynamically created with `app_label = 'migrations'` and `db_table = 'django_migrations'`\n- Database alias is available via `self.connection.alias`\n- Current imports: `Apps`, `DatabaseError`, `models`, `classproperty`, `now`, `MigrationSchemaMissing`\n\n## Specific Bug Locations Identified\n\n### Location 1: ensure_schema() method (lines 59-70)\n**Current Code**: Creates migrations table without router permission checks\n**Issue**: Core problem - creates table on databases where router forbids migrations\n**Fix Required**: Add router check before table creation, return early if denied\n\n### Location 2: record_applied() method (lines 84-87)\n**Current Code**: Calls `ensure_schema()` and creates migration records without checks\n**Issue**: Can trigger unauthorized table creation and record insertion\n**Fix Required**: Add router check before operations, return early if denied\n\n### Location 3: record_unapplied() method (lines 89-92)\n**Current Code**: Calls `ensure_schema()` and deletes migration records without checks\n**Issue**: Can trigger unauthorized table creation and record deletion\n**Fix Required**: Add router check before operations, return early if denied\n\n### Location 4: applied_migrations() method (lines 72-82)\n**Current Code**: Queries migrations table without router permission checks\n**Issue**: Performs unauthorized database queries\n**Fix Required**: Add router check, return empty dict `{}` if denied\n\n### Location 5: flush() method (lines 94-96)\n**Current Code**: Deletes all migration records without router checks\n**Issue**: Performs unauthorized deletion operations\n**Fix Required**: Add router check before deletion, return early if denied\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Required Changes\n1. **Import Addition**: Add `from django.db import router` (note: `router` not in current imports)\n2. **Router Check Pattern**: Use `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)`\n3. **Graceful Handling**: Return appropriate defaults when router denies access\n\n### Method Interdependencies\n- `record_applied()` and `record_unapplied()` both call `ensure_schema()`\n- Fixing `ensure_schema()` prevents unauthorized table creation\n- Other methods need individual router checks for query/modification operations\n\n## Current Status\n- **Completed**: Project structure exploration and bug identification\n- **Completed**: Analysis of current MigrationRecorder implementation  \n- **Completed**: Research of Django's router patterns and conventions\n- **Completed**: Detailed code analysis of all vulnerable locations\n- **Completed**: Location identification and patch preparation\n- **In Progress**: Implementing router checks in MigrationRecorder methods\n\n## Next Steps\nReady to implement the router permission checks in all five identified locations using the pattern `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` with appropriate fallback behaviors for each method type.\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Mapped Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined MigrationRecorder source code and router utilities\n- `search_code_with_context`: Found router usage patterns across Django codebase\n\nThe bug is clearly identified with precise locations and the solution approach is well-defined. Implementation is ready to proceed.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 59\nEnd line: 70\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 84\nEnd line: 87\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 89\nEnd line: 92\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 72\nEnd line: 82\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 94\nEnd line: 96\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on the problem statement and code analysis, the MigrationRecorder class needs to respect database router `allow_migrate` rules before performing any database operations. The router should be consulted using `router.allow_migrate_model()` to determine if the migrations table can be created or modified on a specific database connection.\n\n1. **[Lines 59-70 - ensure_schema method]**: Add router check before creating the migrations table. If the router denies migration access, the method should return early without creating the table. This prevents the core issue where Django creates migration tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids migrations.\n\n2. **[Lines 84-87 - record_applied method]**: Add router check before recording applied migrations. If the router denies access, the method should return early without calling `ensure_schema()` or creating migration records. This depends on the router check in ensure_schema (location 1) to prevent table creation.\n\n3. **[Lines 89-92 - record_unapplied method]**: Add router check before recording unapplied migrations. If the router denies access, the method should return early without calling `ensure_schema()` or deleting migration records. This works in coordination with locations 1 and 2 to maintain consistency.\n\n4. **[Lines 72-82 - applied_migrations method]**: Add router check before querying migrations. If the router denies access, return an empty dictionary `{}` to indicate no applied migrations, which is the expected behavior when migrations are not allowed on that database connection. This supports the other methods by providing consistent behavior.\n\n5. **[Lines 94-96 - flush method]**: Add router check before deleting migration records. If the router denies access, the method should return early without performing any deletion operations. This completes the protection by ensuring no migration-related database operations occur when the router forbids them.\n\n**Implementation Pattern**: All methods should import `from django.db import router` and use `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` to check permissions. When access is denied, methods should fail gracefully by returning appropriate default values or skipping operations entirely.\nNote that the Patch provided should be a direct substitution of the location code by the Locator.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nLooking at the code segments and the problem statement, I can see that these locations are indeed the correct places where the bug manifests. The issue is clear:\n\n**Problem**: The MigrationRecorder methods perform database operations without checking if the database router allows migrations on the specific database connection. According to the problem statement, when a router returns `False` for `allow_migrate()`, Django should not create or modify the migrations table on that database connection.\n\n**Analysis of Each Location**:\n\n1. **Location 1 (ensure_schema)**: This is the core issue - it creates the migrations table without checking router permissions. This directly violates the router's `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n2. **Location 2 (record_applied)**: Calls `ensure_schema()` and creates migration records without router checks, which can trigger table creation on forbidden databases.\n\n3. **Location 3 (record_unapplied)**: Similar to Location 2, calls `ensure_schema()` and performs delete operations without router permission checks.\n\n4. **Location 4 (applied_migrations)**: Queries the migrations table without checking if the router allows migrations on this database connection.\n\n5. **Location 5 (flush)**: Deletes migration records without router permission checks.\n\n**Required Fix Pattern**: \n- Import `from django.db import router` \n- Add `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` checks before database operations\n- Return appropriate defaults when router denies access (empty dict for queries, early return for operations)\n\n**Interconnection**: These methods work together - `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` both call `ensure_schema`, so fixing `ensure_schema` will prevent table creation, while the other methods need individual router checks to prevent unauthorized queries and operations.\n\nThe locations are clearly identified and the fix approach is well-defined based on Django's router patterns found in the codebase.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 59-70\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  from django.apps.registry import Apps\n  from django.db import DatabaseError, models\n  from django.utils.functional import classproperty\n  from django.utils.timezone import now\n  from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   49:     @property\n[C]   50:     def migration_qs(self):\n[C]   51:         return self.Migration.objects.using(self.connection.alias)\n[C]   52: \n[C]   53:     def has_table(self):\n[C]   54:         \"\"\"Return True if the django_migrations table exists.\"\"\"\n[C]   55:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n[C]   56:             tables = self.connection.introspection.table_names(cursor)\n[C]   57:         return self.Migration._meta.db_table in tables\n[C]   58: \n[R]   59:     def ensure_schema(self):\n[R]   60:         \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n[R]   61:         # If the table's there, that's fine -

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 59-70\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def ensure_schema(self):\n        \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n        # If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema\n        # in the codebase.\n        if self.has_table():\n            return\n        # Make the table\n        try:\n            with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n                editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n        except DatabaseError as exc:\n            raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 84-87\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def record_applied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was applied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 89-92\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def record_unapplied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was unapplied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 72-82\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def applied_migrations(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return a dict mapping (app_name, migration_name) to Migration instances\n        for all applied migrations.\n        \"\"\"\n        if self.has_table():\n            return {(migration.app, migration.name): migration for migration in self.migration_qs}\n        else:\n            # If the django_migrations table doesn't exist, then no migrations\n            # are applied.\n            return {}\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 94-96\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def flush(self):\n        \"\"\"Delete all migration records.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django MigrationRecorder Bug Fix Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nFix a bug in Django's `MigrationRecorder` class where it doesn't respect database router `allow_migrate` rules when creating, querying, or modifying the `django_migrations` table.\n\n## Problem Analysis\nThe `MigrationRecorder` class in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` performs database operations on the `django_migrations` table without checking if the database router allows migrations for this model. This violates Django's multi-database routing conventions.\n\n## Key Findings from Code Exploration\n\n### Current MigrationRecorder Implementation\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70): Creates the migrations table without router checks\n  - `record_applied()` (lines 84-87): Records applied migrations without router checks\n  - `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92): Records unapplied migrations without router checks\n  - `applied_migrations()` (lines 72-82): Queries migrations without router checks\n  - `flush()` (lines 94-96): Deletes migration records without router checks\n\n### Django Router Pattern Analysis\nFrom examining other Django components, the standard pattern is:\n- Use `router.allow_migrate_model(db_alias, model)` to check if a model can be migrated\n- Use `router.allow_migrate(db_alias, app_label, **hints)` for general migration checks\n- Router utilities are available in `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/utils.py`\n\n## Detailed Technical Analysis\n\n### Router Implementation Details\n- `router.allow_migrate_model(db, model)` calls `router.allow_migrate(db, model._meta.app_label, model_name=model._meta.model_name, model=model)`\n- Returns `True` by default if no router explicitly denies access\n- Returns `False` when a router explicitly forbids migrations on that database\n\n### MigrationRecorder Structure\n- Migration model is dynamically created with `app_label = 'migrations'` and `db_table = 'django_migrations'`\n- Database alias is available via `self.connection.alias`\n- Current imports: `Apps`, `DatabaseError`, `models`, `classproperty`, `now`, `MigrationSchemaMissing`\n\n## Specific Bug Locations Identified\n\n### Location 1: ensure_schema() method (lines 59-70)\n**Current Code**: Creates migrations table without router permission checks\n**Issue**: Core problem - creates table on databases where router forbids migrations\n**Fix Required**: Add router check before table creation, return early if denied\n\n### Location 2: record_applied() method (lines 84-87)\n**Current Code**: Calls `ensure_schema()` and creates migration records without checks\n**Issue**: Can trigger unauthorized table creation and record insertion\n**Fix Required**: Add router check before operations, return early if denied\n\n### Location 3: record_unapplied() method (lines 89-92)\n**Current Code**: Calls `ensure_schema()` and deletes migration records without checks\n**Issue**: Can trigger unauthorized table creation and record deletion\n**Fix Required**: Add router check before operations, return early if denied\n\n### Location 4: applied_migrations() method (lines 72-82)\n**Current Code**: Queries migrations table without router permission checks\n**Issue**: Performs unauthorized database queries\n**Fix Required**: Add router check, return empty dict `{}` if denied\n\n### Location 5: flush() method (lines 94-96)\n**Current Code**: Deletes all migration records without router checks\n**Issue**: Performs unauthorized deletion operations\n**Fix Required**: Add router check before deletion, return early if denied\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Required Changes\n1. **Import Addition**: Add `from django.db import router` (note: `router` not in current imports)\n2. **Router Check Pattern**: Use `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)`\n3. **Graceful Handling**: Return appropriate defaults when router denies access\n\n### Method Interdependencies\n- `record_applied()` and `record_unapplied()` both call `ensure_schema()`\n- Fixing `ensure_schema()` prevents unauthorized table creation\n- Other methods need individual router checks for query/modification operations\n\n## Current Status\n- **Completed**: Project structure exploration and bug identification\n- **Completed**: Analysis of current MigrationRecorder implementation  \n- **Completed**: Research of Django's router patterns and conventions\n- **Completed**: Detailed code analysis of all vulnerable locations\n- **Completed**: Location identification and patch preparation\n- **In Progress**: Implementing router checks in MigrationRecorder methods\n\n## Next Steps\nReady to implement the router permission checks in all five identified locations using the pattern `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` with appropriate fallback behaviors for each method type.\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Mapped Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Examined MigrationRecorder source code and router utilities\n- `search_code_with_context`: Found router usage patterns across Django codebase\n\nThe bug is clearly identified with precise locations and the solution approach is well-defined. Implementation is ready to proceed.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 59\nEnd line: 70\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 84\nEnd line: 87\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 89\nEnd line: 92\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 72\nEnd line: 82\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 94\nEnd line: 96\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on the problem statement and code analysis, the MigrationRecorder class needs to respect database router `allow_migrate` rules before performing any database operations. The router should be consulted using `router.allow_migrate_model()` to determine if the migrations table can be created or modified on a specific database connection.\n\n1. **[Lines 59-70 - ensure_schema method]**: Add router check before creating the migrations table. If the router denies migration access, the method should return early without creating the table. This prevents the core issue where Django creates migration tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids migrations.\n\n2. **[Lines 84-87 - record_applied method]**: Add router check before recording applied migrations. If the router denies access, the method should return early without calling `ensure_schema()` or creating migration records. This depends on the router check in ensure_schema (location 1) to prevent table creation.\n\n3. **[Lines 89-92 - record_unapplied method]**: Add router check before recording unapplied migrations. If the router denies access, the method should return early without calling `ensure_schema()` or deleting migration records. This works in coordination with locations 1 and 2 to maintain consistency.\n\n4. **[Lines 72-82 - applied_migrations method]**: Add router check before querying migrations. If the router denies access, return an empty dictionary `{}` to indicate no applied migrations, which is the expected behavior when migrations are not allowed on that database connection. This supports the other methods by providing consistent behavior.\n\n5. **[Lines 94-96 - flush method]**: Add router check before deleting migration records. If the router denies access, the method should return early without performing any deletion operations. This completes the protection by ensuring no migration-related database operations occur when the router forbids them.\n\n**Implementation Pattern**: All methods should import `from django.db import router` and use `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` to check permissions. When access is denied, methods should fail gracefully by returning appropriate default values or skipping operations entirely.\nNote that the Patch provided should be a direct substitution of the location code by the Locator.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nLooking at the code segments and the problem statement, I can see that these locations are indeed the correct places where the bug manifests. The issue is clear:\n\n**Problem**: The MigrationRecorder methods perform database operations without checking if the database router allows migrations on the specific database connection. According to the problem statement, when a router returns `False` for `allow_migrate()`, Django should not create or modify the migrations table on that database connection.\n\n**Analysis of Each Location**:\n\n1. **Location 1 (ensure_schema)**: This is the core issue - it creates the migrations table without checking router permissions. This directly violates the router's `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n2. **Location 2 (record_applied)**: Calls `ensure_schema()` and creates migration records without router checks, which can trigger table creation on forbidden databases.\n\n3. **Location 3 (record_unapplied)**: Similar to Location 2, calls `ensure_schema()` and performs delete operations without router permission checks.\n\n4. **Location 4 (applied_migrations)**: Queries the migrations table without checking if the router allows migrations on this database connection.\n\n5. **Location 5 (flush)**: Deletes migration records without router permission checks.\n\n**Required Fix Pattern**: \n- Import `from django.db import router` \n- Add `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` checks before database operations\n- Return appropriate defaults when router denies access (empty dict for queries, early return for operations)\n\n**Interconnection**: These methods work together - `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` both call `ensure_schema`, so fixing `ensure_schema` will prevent table creation, while the other methods need individual router checks to prevent unauthorized queries and operations.\n\nThe locations are clearly identified and the fix approach is well-defined based on Django's router patterns found in the codebase.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 59-70\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  from django.apps.registry import Apps\n  from django.db import DatabaseError, models\n  from django.utils.functional import classproperty\n  from django.utils.timezone import now\n  from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   49:     @property\n[C]   50:     def migration_qs(self):\n[C]   51:         return self.Migration.objects.using(self.connection.alias)\n[C]   52: \n[C]   53:     def has_table(self):\n[C]   54:         \"\"\"Return True if the django_migrations table exists.\"\"\"\n[C]   55:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n[C]   56:             tables = self.connection.introspection.table_names(cursor)\n[C]   57:         return self.Migration._meta.db_table in tables\n[C]   58: \n[R]   59:     def ensure_schema(self):\n[R]   60:         \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n[R]   61:         # If the table's there, that's fine -

I need to import `router` from `django.db` and add checks using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)`.\n\nLet me examine the import structure first to understand what needs to be added:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 10 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 1-10:\n\n   1: from django.apps.registry import Apps\n   2: from django.db import DatabaseError, models\n   3: from django.utils.functional import classproperty\n   4: from django.utils.timezone import now\n   5: \n   6: from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n   7: \n   8: \n   9: class MigrationRecorder:\n  10:     \"\"\"\n\n#REFLECT\nLooking at the code and problem statement, I need to:\n\n1. Add `router` import to the existing imports (line 2 already imports from `django.db`, so I need to add `router` to that import)\n2. Add router checks using `router.allow_migrate_model(self.connection.alias, self.Migration)` in each of the 5 locations\n3. For each method, if the router denies access, return appropriate defaults or skip operations\n\nThe pattern should be:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Return early if router denies access\n- `record_applied()` and `record_unapplied()`: Return early if router denies access  \n- `applied_migrations()`: Return empty dict `{}` if router denies access\n- `flush()`: Return early if router denies access\n\nLet me check how the import should be modified:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 6 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 1-6:\n\n   1: from django.apps.registry import Apps\n   2: from django.db import DatabaseError, models\n   3: from django.utils.functional import classproperty\n   4: from django.utils.timezone import now\n   5: \n   6: from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 59-70\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def ensure_schema(self):\n        \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n        # If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema\n        # in the codebase.\n        if self.has_table():\n            return\n        # Make the table\n        try:\n            with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n                editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n        except DatabaseError as exc:\n            raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 84-87\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def record_applied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was applied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 89-92\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def record_unapplied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was unapplied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 72-82\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def applied_migrations(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return a dict mapping (app_name, migration_name) to Migration instances\n        for all applied migrations.\n        \"\"\"\n        if self.has_table():\n            return {(migration.app, migration.name): migration for migration in self.migration_qs}\n        else:\n            # If the django_migrations table doesn't exist, then no migrations\n            # are applied.\n            return {}\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 94-96\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def flush(self):\n        \"\"\"Delete all migration records.
