    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Squashing Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's migration system where squashing migrations doesn't properly handle the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings even after the squashing process completes. This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- Need to examine how `index_together` operations are reduced/optimized during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Encountered\n- The search results were truncated, indicating more code needs to be examined\n- Haven't yet found the specific optimization logic that should convert `index_together` to `indexes` during squashing\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions  \n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete the code search** - Examine the truncated results to find all `index_together` references\n2. **Analyze reduction logic** - Look at how `AlterIndexTogether` operations are reduced/optimized\n3. **Find the conversion logic** - Locate where `index_together` should be converted to `indexes` during squashing\n4. **Identify the bug** - Determine why the conversion isn't happening properly during migration optimization\n5. **Implement the fix** - Add or correct the optimization logic to handle the transition\n\nThe investigation has successfully mapped the migration system architecture and identified the key components involved in the bug, setting up a clear path for finding and fixing the optimization issue.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nThe bug is about squashing migrations not properly handling the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Squashing Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's migration system where squashing migrations doesn't properly handle the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings even after the squashing process completes. This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- Need to examine how `index_together` operations are reduced/optimized during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Encountered\n- The search results were truncated, indicating more code needs to be examined\n- Haven't yet found the specific optimization logic that should convert `index_together` to `indexes` during squashing\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions  \n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete the code search** - Examine the truncated results to find all `index_together` references\n2. **Analyze reduction logic** - Look at how `AlterIndexTogether` operations are reduced/optimized\n3. **Find the conversion logic** - Locate where `index_together` should be converted to `indexes` during squashing\n4. **Identify the bug** - Determine why the conversion isn't happening properly during migration optimization\n5. **Implement the fix** - Add or correct the optimization logic to handle the transition\n\nThe investigation has successfully mapped the migration system architecture and identified the key components involved in the bug, setting up a clear path for finding and fixing the optimization issue.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nThe bug is about squashing migrations not properly handling the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Squashing Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's migration system where squashing migrations doesn't properly handle the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings even after the squashing process completes. This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- Need to examine how `index_together` operations are reduced/optimized during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Encountered\n- The search results were truncated, indicating more code needs to be examined\n- Haven't yet found the specific optimization logic that should convert `index_together` to `indexes` during squashing\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions  \n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete the code search** - Examine the truncated results to find all `index_together` references\n2. **Analyze reduction logic** - Look at how `AlterIndexTogether` operations are reduced/optimized\n3. **Find the conversion logic** - Locate where `index_together` should be converted to `indexes` during squashing\n4. **Identify the bug** - Determine why the conversion isn't happening properly during migration optimization\n5. **Implement the fix** - Add or correct the optimization logic to handle the transition\n\nThe investigation has successfully mapped the migration system architecture and identified the key components involved in the bug, setting up a clear path for finding and fixing the optimization issue.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nThe bug is about squashing migrations not properly handling the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings. I need to look at the models.py operations file since this would handle model-level operations like changing Meta options.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from django.db import models\n   2: from django.db.migrations.operations.base import Operation\n   3: from django.db.migrations.state import ModelState\n   4: from django.db.migrations.utils import field_references, resolve_relation\n   5: from django.db.models.options import normalize_together\n   6: from django.utils.functional import cached_property\n   7: \n   8: from .fields import AddField, AlterField, FieldOperation, RemoveField, RenameField\n   9: \n  10: \n  11: def _check_for_duplicates(arg_name, objs):\n  12:     used_vals = set()\n  13:     for val in objs:\n  14:         if val in used_vals:\n  15:             raise ValueError(\n  16:                 \"Found duplicate value %s in CreateModel %s argument.\" % (val, arg_name)\n  17:             )\n  18:         used_vals.add(val)\n  19: \n  20: \n  21: class ModelOperation(Operation):\n  22:     def __init__(self, name):\n  23:         self.name = name\n  24: \n  25:     @cached_property\n  26:     def name_lower(self):\n  27:         return self.name.lower()\n  28: \n  29:     def references_model(self, name, app_label):\n  30:         return name.lower() == self.name_lower\n  31: \n  32:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n  33:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label) or self.can_reduce_through(\n  34:             operation, app_label\n  35:         )\n  36: \n  37:     def can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label):\n  38:         return not operation.references_model(self.name, app_label)\n  39: \n  40: \n  41: class CreateModel(ModelOperation):\n  42:     \"\"\"Create a model's table.\"\"\"\n  43: \n  44:     serialization_expand_args = [\"fields\", \"options\", \"managers\"]\n  45: \n  46:     def __init__(self, name, fields, options=None, bases=None, managers=None):\n  47:         self.fields = fields\n  48:         self.options = options or {}\n  49:         self.bases = bases or (models.Model,)\n  50:         self.managers = managers or []\n\n#REFLECT\nI can see this is about model operations and the CreateModel operation handles options.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Squashing Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's migration system where squashing migrations doesn't properly handle the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings even after the squashing process completes. This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- Need to examine how `index_together` operations are reduced/optimized during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Encountered\n- The search results were truncated, indicating more code needs to be examined\n- Haven't yet found the specific optimization logic that should convert `index_together` to `indexes` during squashing\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions  \n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete the code search** - Examine the truncated results to find all `index_together` references\n2. **Analyze reduction logic** - Look at how `AlterIndexTogether` operations are reduced/optimized\n3. **Find the conversion logic** - Locate where `index_together` should be converted to `indexes` during squashing\n4. **Identify the bug** - Determine why the conversion isn't happening properly during migration optimization\n5. **Implement the fix** - Add or correct the optimization logic to handle the transition\n\nThe investigation has successfully mapped the migration system architecture and identified the key components involved in the bug, setting up a clear path for finding and fixing the optimization issue.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nThe bug is about squashing migrations not properly handling the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings. I need to look at the models.py operations file since this would handle model-level operations like changing Meta options.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from django.db import models\n   2: from django.db.migrations.operations.base import Operation\n   3: from django.db.migrations.state import ModelState\n   4: from django.db.migrations.utils import field_references, resolve_relation\n   5: from django.db.models.options import normalize_together\n   6: from django.utils.functional import cached_property\n   7: \n   8: from .fields import AddField, AlterField, FieldOperation, RemoveField, RenameField\n   9: \n  10: \n  11: def _check_for_duplicates(arg_name, objs):\n  12:     used_vals = set()\n  13:     for val in objs:\n  14:         if val in used_vals:\n  15:             raise ValueError(\n  16:                 \"Found duplicate value %s in CreateModel %s argument.\" % (val, arg_name)\n  17:             )\n  18:         used_vals.add(val)\n  19: \n  20: \n  21: class ModelOperation(Operation):\n  22:     def __init__(self, name):\n  23:         self.name = name\n  24: \n  25:     @cached_property\n  26:     def name_lower(self):\n  27:         return self.name.lower()\n  28: \n  29:     def references_model(self, name, app_label):\n  30:         return name.lower() == self.name_lower\n  31: \n  32:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n  33:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label) or self.can_reduce_through(\n  34:             operation, app_label\n  35:         )\n  36: \n  37:     def can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label):\n  38:         return not operation.references_model(self.name, app_label)\n  39: \n  40: \n  41: class CreateModel(ModelOperation):\n  42:     \"\"\"Create a model's table.\"\"\"\n  43: \n  44:     serialization_expand_args = [\"fields\", \"options\", \"managers\"]\n  45: \n  46:     def __init__(self, name, fields, options=None, bases=None, managers=None):\n  47:         self.fields = fields\n  48:         self.options = options or {}\n  49:         self.bases = bases or (models.Model,)\n  50:         self.managers = managers or []\n\n#REFLECT\nI can see this is about model operations and the CreateModel operation handles options.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Squashing Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's migration system where squashing migrations doesn't properly handle the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings even after the squashing process completes. This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- Need to examine how `index_together` operations are reduced/optimized during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Encountered\n- The search results were truncated, indicating more code needs to be examined\n- Haven't yet found the specific optimization logic that should convert `index_together` to `indexes` during squashing\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions  \n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete the code search** - Examine the truncated results to find all `index_together` references\n2. **Analyze reduction logic** - Look at how `AlterIndexTogether` operations are reduced/optimized\n3. **Find the conversion logic** - Locate where `index_together` should be converted to `indexes` during squashing\n4. **Identify the bug** - Determine why the conversion isn't happening properly during migration optimization\n5. **Implement the fix** - Add or correct the optimization logic to handle the transition\n\nThe investigation has successfully mapped the migration system architecture and identified the key components involved in the bug, setting up a clear path for finding and fixing the optimization issue.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nThe bug is about squashing migrations not properly handling the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings. I need to look at the models.py operations file since this would handle model-level operations like changing Meta options.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from django.db import models\n   2: from django.db.migrations.operations.base import Operation\n   3: from django.db.migrations.state import ModelState\n   4: from django.db.migrations.utils import field_references, resolve_relation\n   5: from django.db.models.options import normalize_together\n   6: from django.utils.functional import cached_property\n   7: \n   8: from .fields import AddField, AlterField, FieldOperation, RemoveField, RenameField\n   9: \n  10: \n  11: def _check_for_duplicates(arg_name, objs):\n  12:     used_vals = set()\n  13:     for val in objs:\n  14:         if val in used_vals:\n  15:             raise ValueError(\n  16:                 \"Found duplicate value %s in CreateModel %s argument.\" % (val, arg_name)\n  17:             )\n  18:         used_vals.add(val)\n  19: \n  20: \n  21: class ModelOperation(Operation):\n  22:     def __init__(self, name):\n  23:         self.name = name\n  24: \n  25:     @cached_property\n  26:     def name_lower(self):\n  27:         return self.name.lower()\n  28: \n  29:     def references_model(self, name, app_label):\n  30:         return name.lower() == self.name_lower\n  31: \n  32:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n  33:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label) or self.can_reduce_through(\n  34:             operation, app_label\n  35:         )\n  36: \n  37:     def can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label):\n  38:         return not operation.references_model(self.name, app_label)\n  39: \n  40: \n  41: class CreateModel(ModelOperation):\n  42:     \"\"\"Create a model's table.\"\"\"\n  43: \n  44:     serialization_expand_args = [\"fields\", \"options\", \"managers\"]\n  45: \n  46:     def __init__(self, name, fields, options=None, bases=None, managers=None):\n  47:         self.fields = fields\n  48:         self.options = options or {}\n  49:         self.bases = bases or (models.Model,)\n  50:         self.managers = managers or []\n\n#REFLECT\nI can see this is about model operations and the CreateModel operation handles options.

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Django Migration Squashing Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's migration system where squashing migrations doesn't properly handle the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings even after the squashing process completes. This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- Need to examine how `index_together` operations are reduced/optimized during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Encountered\n- The search results were truncated, indicating more code needs to be examined\n- Haven't yet found the specific optimization logic that should convert `index_together` to `indexes` during squashing\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions  \n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete the code search** - Examine the truncated results to find all `index_together` references\n2. **Analyze reduction logic** - Look at how `AlterIndexTogether` operations are reduced/optimized\n3. **Find the conversion logic** - Locate where `index_together` should be converted to `indexes` during squashing\n4. **Identify the bug** - Determine why the conversion isn't happening properly during migration optimization\n5. **Implement the fix** - Add or correct the optimization logic to handle the transition\n\nThe investigation has successfully mapped the migration system architecture and identified the key components involved in the bug, setting up a clear path for finding and fixing the optimization issue.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nThe bug is about squashing migrations not properly handling the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings. I need to look at the models.py operations file since this would handle model-level operations like changing Meta options.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from django.db import models\n   2: from django.db.migrations.operations.base import Operation\n   3: from django.db.migrations.state import ModelState\n   4: from django.db.migrations.utils import field_references, resolve_relation\n   5: from django.db.models.options import normalize_together\n   6: from django.utils.functional import cached_property\n   7: \n   8: from .fields import AddField, AlterField, FieldOperation, RemoveField, RenameField\n   9: \n  10: \n  11: def _check_for_duplicates(arg_name, objs):\n  12:     used_vals = set()\n  13:     for val in objs:\n  14:         if val in used_vals:\n  15:             raise ValueError(\n  16:                 \"Found duplicate value %s in CreateModel %s argument.\" % (val, arg_name)\n  17:             )\n  18:         used_vals.add(val)\n  19: \n  20: \n  21: class ModelOperation(Operation):\n  22:     def __init__(self, name):\n  23:         self.name = name\n  24: \n  25:     @cached_property\n  26:     def name_lower(self):\n  27:         return self.name.lower()\n  28: \n  29:     def references_model(self, name, app_label):\n  30:         return name.lower() == self.name_lower\n  31: \n  32:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n  33:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label) or self.can_reduce_through(\n  34:             operation, app_label\n  35:         )\n  36: \n  37:     def can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label):\n  38:         return not operation.references_model(self.name, app_label)\n  39: \n  40: \n  41: class CreateModel(ModelOperation):\n  42:     \"\"\"Create a model's table.\"\"\"\n  43: \n  44:     serialization_expand_args = [\"fields\", \"options\", \"managers\"]\n  45: \n  46:     def __init__(self, name, fields, options=None, bases=None, managers=None):\n  47:         self.fields = fields\n  48:         self.options = options or {}\n  49:         self.bases = bases or (models.Model,)\n  50:         self.managers = managers or []\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nI can see this is about model operations and the CreateModel operation handles options.

AlterTogetherOptionOperation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: Lines 530-630 of `/operations/models.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**:\n  - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` has a `can_reduce_through()` method (lines 620-624)\n  - Method allows reduction between different types of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n  - **BUT**: No specific logic found for reducing `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n- **NEW**: Located the exact `AlterIndexTogether` operation class and its parent\n- **NEW**: Identified that `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` handles reduction logic\n- **NEW**: Confirmed the inheritance hierarchy: `AlterIndexTogether` → `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` → `ModelOptionOperation` → `ModelOperation` → `Operation`\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- **NEW**: Need to examine how `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be reduced with `AddIndex` operations during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Identified\n- **CRITICAL BUG LOCATION**: The `can_reduce_through()` method in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types, but doesn't handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations\n- This means when migrations are squashed, `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- The deprecation warnings persist because the old `index_together` operations remain in the squashed migration instead of being optimized away\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions, specifically:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648)\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` parent class (lines 562-624)\n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n- **NEW**: `can_reduce_through()` method controls which operations can be reduced together during squashing\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug occurs because:\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used\n2. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations\n3. `AlterIndexTogether.can_reduce_through()` only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n4. It doesn't have logic to reduce with `AddIndex` operations that represent the modern `Meta.indexes` approach\n5. Therefore, the old `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine AddIndex operation** - Look at how `AddIndex` operations work and their reduction logic\n2. **Implement cross-operation reduction** - Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n3. **Add conversion logic** - Create method to convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects during reduction\n4. **Test the fix** - Verify that squashed migrations properly convert `index_together` to `indexes` without deprecation warnings\n5. **Handle edge cases** - Ensure the fix works with complex scenarios like partial overlaps, renames, etc.\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the root cause: missing reduction logic between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations during migration squashing. The fix will require extending the reduction capabilities to handle the `index_together` → `indexes` transition properly.",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Squashing Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's migration system where squashing migrations doesn't properly handle the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings even after the squashing process completes. This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n### 7. Autodetector Method Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `generate_removed_altered_index_together` method in `autodetector.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Method calls `_generate_removed_altered_foo_together(operations.AlterIndexTogether)`\n  - Generic method handles both `unique_together` and `index_together`\n  - Lines 1520-1569 show the implementation uses `AlterIndexTogether` operations\n\n### 8. AlterIndexTogether Operation Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `AlterIndexTogether` class in `/operations/models.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 639-648)\n  - Has `option_name = \"index_together\"`\n  - Parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` handles the core logic (lines 562-624)\n\n### 9. AlterTogetherOptionOperation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: Lines 530-630 of `/operations/models.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**:\n  - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` has a `can_reduce_through()` method (lines 620-624)\n  - Method allows reduction between different types of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n  - **BUT**: No specific logic found for reducing `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n- **NEW**: Located the exact `AlterIndexTogether` operation class and its parent\n- **NEW**: Identified that `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` handles reduction logic\n- **NEW**: Confirmed the inheritance hierarchy: `AlterIndexTogether` → `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` → `ModelOptionOperation` → `ModelOperation` → `Operation`\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- **NEW**: Need to examine how `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be reduced with `AddIndex` operations during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Identified\n- **CRITICAL BUG LOCATION**: The `can_reduce_through()` method in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types, but doesn't handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations\n- This means when migrations are squashed, `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- The deprecation warnings persist because the old `index_together` operations remain in the squashed migration instead of being optimized away\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions, specifically:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648)\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` parent class (lines 562-624)\n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n- **NEW**: `can_reduce_through()` method controls which operations can be reduced together during squashing\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug occurs because:\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used\n2.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Squashing Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's migration system where squashing migrations doesn't properly handle the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings even after the squashing process completes. This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n### 7. Autodetector Method Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `generate_removed_altered_index_together` method in `autodetector.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Method calls `_generate_removed_altered_foo_together(operations.AlterIndexTogether)`\n  - Generic method handles both `unique_together` and `index_together`\n  - Lines 1520-1569 show the implementation uses `AlterIndexTogether` operations\n\n### 8. AlterIndexTogether Operation Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `AlterIndexTogether` class in `/operations/models.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 639-648)\n  - Has `option_name = \"index_together\"`\n  - Parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` handles the core logic (lines 562-624)\n\n### 9. AlterTogetherOptionOperation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: Lines 530-630 of `/operations/models.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**:\n  - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` has a `can_reduce_through()` method (lines 620-624)\n  - Method allows reduction between different types of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n  - **BUT**: No specific logic found for reducing `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n- **NEW**: Located the exact `AlterIndexTogether` operation class and its parent\n- **NEW**: Identified that `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` handles reduction logic\n- **NEW**: Confirmed the inheritance hierarchy: `AlterIndexTogether` → `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` → `ModelOptionOperation` → `ModelOperation` → `Operation`\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- **NEW**: Need to examine how `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be reduced with `AddIndex` operations during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Identified\n- **CRITICAL BUG LOCATION**: The `can_reduce_through()` method in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types, but doesn't handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations\n- This means when migrations are squashed, `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- The deprecation warnings persist because the old `index_together` operations remain in the squashed migration instead of being optimized away\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions, specifically:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648)\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` parent class (lines 562-624)\n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n- **NEW**: `can_reduce_through()` method controls which operations can be reduced together during squashing\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug occurs because:\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used\n2. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations\n3. `AlterIndexTogether.can_reduce_through()` only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n4. It doesn't have logic to reduce with `AddIndex` operations that represent the modern `Meta.indexes` approach\n5. Therefore, the old `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine AddIndex operation** - Look at how `AddIndex` operations work and their reduction logic\n2. **Implement cross-operation reduction** - Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n3. **Add conversion logic** - Create method to convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects during reduction\n4. **Test the fix** - Verify that squashed migrations properly convert `index_together` to `indexes` without deprecation warnings\n5. **Handle edge cases** - Ensure the fix works with complex scenarios like partial overlaps, renames, etc.\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the root cause: missing reduction logic between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations during migration squashing. The fix will require extending the reduction capabilities to handle the `index_together` → `indexes` transition properly.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI can see that `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`. The bug is about squashing migrations not properly handling the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Squashing Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's migration system where squashing migrations doesn't properly handle the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings even after the squashing process completes. This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n### 7. Autodetector Method Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `generate_removed_altered_index_together` method in `autodetector.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Method calls `_generate_removed_altered_foo_together(operations.AlterIndexTogether)`\n  - Generic method handles both `unique_together` and `index_together`\n  - Lines 1520-1569 show the implementation uses `AlterIndexTogether` operations\n\n### 8. AlterIndexTogether Operation Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `AlterIndexTogether` class in `/operations/models.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 639-648)\n  - Has `option_name = \"index_together\"`\n  - Parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` handles the core logic (lines 562-624)\n\n### 9. AlterTogetherOptionOperation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: Lines 530-630 of `/operations/models.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**:\n  - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` has a `can_reduce_through()` method (lines 620-624)\n  - Method allows reduction between different types of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n  - **BUT**: No specific logic found for reducing `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n- **NEW**: Located the exact `AlterIndexTogether` operation class and its parent\n- **NEW**: Identified that `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` handles reduction logic\n- **NEW**: Confirmed the inheritance hierarchy: `AlterIndexTogether` → `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` → `ModelOptionOperation` → `ModelOperation` → `Operation`\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- **NEW**: Need to examine how `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be reduced with `AddIndex` operations during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Identified\n- **CRITICAL BUG LOCATION**: The `can_reduce_through()` method in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types, but doesn't handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations\n- This means when migrations are squashed, `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- The deprecation warnings persist because the old `index_together` operations remain in the squashed migration instead of being optimized away\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions, specifically:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648)\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` parent class (lines 562-624)\n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n- **NEW**: `can_reduce_through()` method controls which operations can be reduced together during squashing\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug occurs because:\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used\n2. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations\n3. `AlterIndexTogether.can_reduce_through()` only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n4. It doesn't have logic to reduce with `AddIndex` operations that represent the modern `Meta.indexes` approach\n5. Therefore, the old `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine AddIndex operation** - Look at how `AddIndex` operations work and their reduction logic\n2. **Implement cross-operation reduction** - Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n3. **Add conversion logic** - Create method to convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects during reduction\n4. **Test the fix** - Verify that squashed migrations properly convert `index_together` to `indexes` without deprecation warnings\n5. **Handle edge cases** - Ensure the fix works with complex scenarios like partial overlaps, renames, etc.\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the root cause: missing reduction logic between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations during migration squashing.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Squashing Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's migration system where squashing migrations doesn't properly handle the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings even after the squashing process completes. This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n### 7. Autodetector Method Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `generate_removed_altered_index_together` method in `autodetector.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Method calls `_generate_removed_altered_foo_together(operations.AlterIndexTogether)`\n  - Generic method handles both `unique_together` and `index_together`\n  - Lines 1520-1569 show the implementation uses `AlterIndexTogether` operations\n\n### 8. AlterIndexTogether Operation Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `AlterIndexTogether` class in `/operations/models.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 639-648)\n  - Has `option_name = \"index_together\"`\n  - Parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` handles the core logic (lines 562-624)\n\n### 9. AlterTogetherOptionOperation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: Lines 530-630 of `/operations/models.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**:\n  - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` has a `can_reduce_through()` method (lines 620-624)\n  - Method allows reduction between different types of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n  - **BUT**: No specific logic found for reducing `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n- **NEW**: Located the exact `AlterIndexTogether` operation class and its parent\n- **NEW**: Identified that `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` handles reduction logic\n- **NEW**: Confirmed the inheritance hierarchy: `AlterIndexTogether` → `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` → `ModelOptionOperation` → `ModelOperation` → `Operation`\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- **NEW**: Need to examine how `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be reduced with `AddIndex` operations during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Identified\n- **CRITICAL BUG LOCATION**: The `can_reduce_through()` method in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types, but doesn't handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations\n- This means when migrations are squashed, `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- The deprecation warnings persist because the old `index_together` operations remain in the squashed migration instead of being optimized away\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions, specifically:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648)\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` parent class (lines 562-624)\n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n- **NEW**: `can_reduce_through()` method controls which operations can be reduced together during squashing\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug occurs because:\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used\n2. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations\n3. `AlterIndexTogether.can_reduce_through()` only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n4. It doesn't have logic to reduce with `AddIndex` operations that represent the modern `Meta.indexes` approach\n5. Therefore, the old `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine AddIndex operation** - Look at how `AddIndex` operations work and their reduction logic\n2. **Implement cross-operation reduction** - Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n3. **Add conversion logic** - Create method to convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects during reduction\n4. **Test the fix** - Verify that squashed migrations properly convert `index_together` to `indexes` without deprecation warnings\n5. **Handle edge cases** - Ensure the fix works with complex scenarios like partial overlaps, renames, etc.\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the root cause: missing reduction logic between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations during migration squashing.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Squashing Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's migration system where squashing migrations doesn't properly handle the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings even after the squashing process completes. This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n### 7. Autodetector Method Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `generate_removed_altered_index_together` method in `autodetector.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Method calls `_generate_removed_altered_foo_together(operations.AlterIndexTogether)`\n  - Generic method handles both `unique_together` and `index_together`\n  - Lines 1520-1569 show the implementation uses `AlterIndexTogether` operations\n\n### 8. AlterIndexTogether Operation Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `AlterIndexTogether` class in `/operations/models.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 639-648)\n  - Has `option_name = \"index_together\"`\n  - Parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` handles the core logic (lines 562-624)\n\n### 9. AlterTogetherOptionOperation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: Lines 530-630 of `/operations/models.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**:\n  - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` has a `can_reduce_through()` method (lines 620-624)\n  - Method allows reduction between different types of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n  - **BUT**: No specific logic found for reducing `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n- **NEW**: Located the exact `AlterIndexTogether` operation class and its parent\n- **NEW**: Identified that `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` handles reduction logic\n- **NEW**: Confirmed the inheritance hierarchy: `AlterIndexTogether` → `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` → `ModelOptionOperation` → `ModelOperation` → `Operation`\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- **NEW**: Need to examine how `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be reduced with `AddIndex` operations during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Identified\n- **CRITICAL BUG LOCATION**: The `can_reduce_through()` method in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types, but doesn't handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations\n- This means when migrations are squashed, `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- The deprecation warnings persist because the old `index_together` operations remain in the squashed migration instead of being optimized away\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions, specifically:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648)\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` parent class (lines 562-624)\n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n- **NEW**: `can_reduce_through()` method controls which operations can be reduced together during squashing\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug occurs because:\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used\n2. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations\n3. `AlterIndexTogether.can_reduce_through()` only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n4. It doesn't have logic to reduce with `AddIndex` operations that represent the modern `Meta.indexes` approach\n5. Therefore, the old `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine AddIndex operation** - Look at how `AddIndex` operations work and their reduction logic\n2. **Implement cross-operation reduction** - Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n3. **Add conversion logic** - Create method to convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects during reduction\n4. **Test the fix** - Verify that squashed migrations properly convert `index_together` to `indexes` without deprecation warnings\n5. **Handle edge cases** - Ensure the fix works with complex scenarios like partial overlaps, renames, etc.\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the root cause: missing reduction logic between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations during migration squashing. The fix will require extending the reduction capabilities to handle the `index_together` → `indexes` transition properly.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI can see that `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`. The bug is about squashing migrations not properly handling the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`. I need to examine the parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` to understand how the `reduce()` method works during migration optimization/squashing.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 580, \"end_line\": 630 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 580-629:\n\n 580:         return (self.__class__.__qualname__, [], kwargs)\n 581: \n 582:     def state_forwards(self, app_label, state):\n 583:         state.alter_model_options(\n 584:             app_label,\n 585:             self.name_lower,\n 586:             {self.option_name: self.option_value},\n 587:         )\n 588: \n 589:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 590:         new_model = to_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.name)\n 591:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, new_model):\n 592:             old_model = from_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.name)\n 593:             alter_together = getattr(schema_editor, \"alter_%s\" % self.option_name)\n 594:             alter_together(\n 595:                 new_model,\n 596:                 getattr(old_model._meta, self.option_name, set()),\n 597:                 getattr(new_model._meta, self.option_name, set()),\n 598:             )\n 599: \n 600:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 601:         return self.database_forwards(app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state)\n 602: \n 603:     def references_field(self, model_name, name, app_label):\n 604:         return self.references_model(model_name, app_label) and (\n 605:             not self.option_value\n 606:             or any((name in fields) for fields in self.option_value)\n 607:         )\n 608: \n 609:     def describe(self):\n 610:         return \"Alter %s for %s (%s constraint(s))\" % (\n 611:             self.option_name,\n 612:             self.name,\n 613:             len(self.option_value or \"\"),\n 614:         )\n 615: \n 616:     @property\n 617:     def migration_name_fragment(self):\n 618:         return \"alter_%s_%s\" % (self.name_lower, self.option_name)\n 619: \n 620:     def can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label):\n 621:         return super().can_reduce_through(operation, app_label) or (\n 622:             isinstance(operation, AlterTogetherOptionOperation)\n 623:             and type(operation) is not type(self)\n 624:         )\n 625: \n 626: \n 627: class AlterUniqueTogether(AlterTogetherOptionOperation):\n 628:     \"\"\"\n 629:     Change the value of unique_together to the target one.\n\n#REFLECT\nI can see that `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` has a `can_reduce_through` method that allows reduction between different types of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`. However, the bug is that when squashing migrations, the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` doesn't properly remove deprecation warnings. \n\nThe issue is likely that `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being properly reduced/optimized with `AddIndex` operations during squashing.

    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and can identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used (deprecated)\n2. `AddIndex` operations are generated when `indexes` is used (modern approach)\n3. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using the `reduce()` method\n4. `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` which only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n5. There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n6. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing persistent deprecation warnings\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class needs enhanced reduction logic to:\n1. Detect when it can be reduced with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n2. Convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects\n3. Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operation\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my investigation, I can identify the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 620-624** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method\nThis method currently only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. It needs to be enhanced to also allow reduction with `AddIndex` operations when the operation is `AlterIndexTogether`.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 639-648** - `AlterIndexTogether` class definition  \nThis class needs a custom `reduce()` method to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations by converting `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 464-470** - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method\nThis base method may need modification to support the new reduction logic for `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 562-579** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.__init__()` and related methods\nThese may need updates to support the conversion logic from `index_together` format to `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 864-867** - `AddIndex.reduce()` method\nThis method may need enhancement to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the other direction.\n\nThe bug manifests in the migration squashing process where `AlterIndexTogether` operations (which generate deprecation warnings) aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, leaving the deprecated operations in the squashed migration files.",

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Django Migration Squashing Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's migration system where squashing migrations doesn't properly handle the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`, leaving deprecation warnings even after the squashing process completes. This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n### 7. Autodetector Method Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `generate_removed_altered_index_together` method in `autodetector.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Method calls `_generate_removed_altered_foo_together(operations.AlterIndexTogether)`\n  - Generic method handles both `unique_together` and `index_together`\n  - Lines 1520-1569 show the implementation uses `AlterIndexTogether` operations\n\n### 8. AlterIndexTogether Operation Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `AlterIndexTogether` class in `/operations/models.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 639-648)\n  - Has `option_name = \"index_together\"`\n  - Parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` handles the core logic (lines 562-624)\n\n### 9. AlterTogetherOptionOperation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: Lines 530-630 of `/operations/models.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**:\n  - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` has a `can_reduce_through()` method (lines 620-624)\n  - Method allows reduction between different types of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n  - **BUT**: No specific logic found for reducing `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n- **NEW**: Located the exact `AlterIndexTogether` operation class and its parent\n- **NEW**: Identified that `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` handles reduction logic\n- **NEW**: Confirmed the inheritance hierarchy: `AlterIndexTogether` → `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` → `ModelOptionOperation` → `ModelOperation` → `Operation`\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- Understanding the exact optimization/reduction logic that should handle the transition\n- **NEW**: Need to examine how `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be reduced with `AddIndex` operations during squashing\n\n### ❌ Issues Identified\n- **CRITICAL BUG LOCATION**: The `can_reduce_through()` method in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types, but doesn't handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations\n- This means when migrations are squashed, `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- The deprecation warnings persist because the old `index_together` operations remain in the squashed migration instead of being optimized away\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions, specifically:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648)\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` parent class (lines 562-624)\n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n- **NEW**: `can_reduce_through()` method controls which operations can be reduced together during squashing\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug occurs because:\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used\n2. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations\n3. `AlterIndexTogether.can_reduce_through()` only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n4. It doesn't have logic to reduce with `AddIndex` operations that represent the modern `Meta.indexes` approach\n5. Therefore, the old `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine AddIndex operation** - Look at how `AddIndex` operations work and their reduction logic\n2. **Implement cross-operation reduction** - Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n3. **Add conversion logic** - Create method to convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects during reduction\n4. **Test the fix** - Verify that squashed migrations properly convert `index_together` to `indexes` without deprecation warnings\n5. **Handle edge cases** - Ensure the fix works with complex scenarios like partial overlaps, renames, etc.\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the root cause: missing reduction logic between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations during migration squashing. The fix will require extending the reduction capabilities to handle the `index_together` → `indexes` transition properly.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nI can see that `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`. The bug is about squashing migrations not properly handling the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`.

During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using the `reduce()` method\n4. `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` which only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n5. There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n6. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing persistent deprecation warnings\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class needs enhanced reduction logic to:\n1.

Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operation\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my investigation, I can identify the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 620-624** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method\nThis method currently only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. It needs to be enhanced to also allow reduction with `AddIndex` operations when the operation is `AlterIndexTogether`.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 639-648** - `AlterIndexTogether` class definition  \nThis class needs a custom `reduce()` method to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations by converting `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 464-470** - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method\nThis base method may need modification to support the new reduction logic for `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 562-579** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.__init__()` and related methods\nThese may need updates to support the conversion logic from `index_together` format to `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 864-867** - `AddIndex.reduce()` method\nThis method may need enhancement to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the other direction.\n\nThe bug manifests in the migration squashing process where `AlterIndexTogether` operations (which generate deprecation warnings) aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, leaving the deprecated operations in the squashed migration files.\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that:\n1.

Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used (deprecated)\n2. `AddIndex` operations are generated when `indexes` is used (modern approach)\n3. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using the `reduce()` method\n4. `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` which only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n5. There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n6. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing persistent deprecation warnings\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class needs enhanced reduction logic to:\n1. Detect when it can be reduced with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n2. Convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects\n3. Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operation\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my investigation, I can identify the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 620-624** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method\nThis method currently only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. It needs to be enhanced to also allow reduction with `AddIndex` operations when the operation is `AlterIndexTogether`.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 639-648** - `AlterIndexTogether` class definition  \nThis class needs a custom `reduce()` method to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations by converting `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 464-470** - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method\nThis base method may need modification to support the new reduction logic for `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 562-579** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.__init__()` and related methods\nThese may need updates to support the conversion logic from `index_together` format to `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 864-867** - `AddIndex.reduce()` method\nThis method may need enhancement to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the other direction.\n\nThe bug manifests in the migration squashing process where `AlterIndexTogether` operations (which generate deprecation warnings) aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, leaving the deprecated operations in the squashed migration files.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nSquashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> indexes transition should remove deprecation warnings.\nDescription\n\t\nSquashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> Meta.indexes transition should remove deprecation warnings.

During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using `reduce()` methods\n4. **MISSING LOGIC**: No reduction path exists between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations\n5. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n**Precise Fix Locations Required:**\n\n1. **Primary Fix - Lines 620-624**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`\n   - **Current**: Only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with `AddIndex` operations\n\n2. **Secondary Fix - Lines 639-648**: `AlterIndexTogether` class\n   - **Current**: Inherits standard reduction logic\n   - **Needed**: Custom `reduce()` method to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Supporting Fix - Lines 864-867**: `AddIndex.reduce()` method\n   - **Current**: Only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` from the reverse direction\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n- Add logic to detect when `AlterIndexTogether` operations can be replaced by equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects during reduction\n- Ensure the conversion maintains the same database schema effect while eliminating deprecation warnings\n- Handle edge cases like partial overlaps, field renames, and complex index configurations\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the complete root cause and exact fix locations.

During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using `reduce()` methods\n4. **MISSING LOGIC**: No reduction path exists between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations\n5. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n**Precise Fix Locations Required:**\n\n1. **Primary Fix - Lines 620-624**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`\n   - **Current**: Only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with `AddIndex` operations\n\n2. **Secondary Fix - Lines 639-648**: `AlterIndexTogether` class\n   - **Current**: Inherits standard reduction logic\n   - **Needed**: Custom `reduce()` method to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Supporting Fix - Lines 864-867**: `AddIndex.reduce()` method\n   - **Current**: Only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` from the reverse direction\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n- Add logic to detect when `AlterIndexTogether` operations can be replaced by equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects during reduction\n- Ensure the conversion maintains the same database schema effect while eliminating deprecation warnings\n- Handle edge cases like partial overlaps, field renames, and complex index configurations\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the complete root cause and exact fix locations. The bug is a missing reduction capability in the migration squashing system that prevents proper optimization of the `index_together` → `indexes` transition.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 639\nEnd line: 648\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 620\nEnd line: 624\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 464\nEnd line: 470\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 864\nEnd line: 867\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 562\nEnd line: 579\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations, the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` doesn't properly remove deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being reduced/optimized with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Current Reduction Logic**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` only reduces with operations of the same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **What Should Happen**: During squashing, `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations to eliminate deprecation warnings.\n\n4. **The Fix Location**: I need to modify the reduction logic in `AlterIndexTogether` or `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations.\n\nLet me examine the rest of the `AddIndex.reduce()` method to see its complete implementation.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 860, \"end_line\": 890 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 860-890:\n\n 860:     @property\n 861:     def migration_name_fragment(self):\n 862:         return \"%s_%s\" % (self.model_name_lower, self.index.name.lower())\n 863: \n 864:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 865:         if isinstance(operation, RemoveIndex) and self.index.name == operation.name:\n 866:             return []\n 867:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n 868: \n 869: \n 870: class RemoveIndex(IndexOperation):\n 871:     \"\"\"Remove an index from a model.\"\"\"\n 872: \n 873:     def __init__(self, model_name, name):\n 874:         self.model_name = model_name\n 875:         self.name = name\n 876: \n 877:     def state_forwards(self, app_label, state):\n 878:         state.remove_index(app_label, self.model_name_lower, self.name)\n 879: \n 880:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 881:         model = from_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)\n 882:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):\n 883:             from_model_state = from_state.models[app_label, self.model_name_lower]\n 884:             index = from_model_state.get_index_by_name(self.name)\n 885:             schema_editor.remove_index(model, index)\n 886: \n 887:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 888:         model = to_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)\n 889:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):\n 890:             to_model_state = to_state.models[app_label, self.model_name_lower]\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and can identify the precise locations that need to be fixed.

The issue is that the migration optimizer lacks the logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` operations with equivalent `AddIndex` operations during the squashing process.\n\nHere are the precise locations that need to be fixed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 639,\n            \"end_line\": 648\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 620,\n            \"end_line\": 624\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 464,\n            \"end_line\": 470\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 864,\n            \"end_line\": 867\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 562,\n            \"end_line\": 579\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Root Cause Summary:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648) inherits reduction logic that only works with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. During migration squashing, when `AlterIndexTogether` operations encounter equivalent `AddIndex` operations, they cannot be reduced together, leaving the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in the squashed migration files, which continue to generate deprecation warnings.\n\nThe fix requires enhancing the reduction logic in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) and potentially adding a custom `reduce()` method to `AlterIndexTogether` to convert deprecated `index_together` operations into equivalent `AddIndex` operations during the squashing process.\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem is exactly what I identified:\n\n**Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate the deprecation warnings because it can't properly reduce/optimize `AlterIndexTogether` operations with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings without manually rewriting their migrations, which defeats the purpose of the squashing feature.\n\n**Root Cause**: The migration optimizer lacks the logic to convert deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations into equivalent `AddIndex` operations during squashing.\n\nNow let me examine the specific code locations to understand exactly what needs to be modified to implement the fix.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 639, \"end_line\": 648 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 639-648:\n\n 639: class AlterIndexTogether(AlterTogetherOptionOperation):\n 640:     \"\"\"\n 641:     Change the value of index_together to the target one.\n 642:     Input value of index_together must be a set of tuples.\n 643:     \"\"\"\n 644: \n 645:     option_name = \"index_together\"\n 646: \n 647:     def __init__(self, name, index_together):\n 648:         super().__init__(name, index_together)\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1.

    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I have a clear view of the `AlterIndexTogether` class. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **What this code does**: The `AlterIndexTogether` class is a simple subclass of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` that handles changes to the `index_together` Meta option. It just sets `option_name = \"index_together\"` and calls the parent constructor.\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This class is responsible for generating migration operations when `index_together` is used. During squashing, these operations persist because there's no logic to convert them to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, causing deprecation warnings to remain.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is one of the core locations where the fix needs to be implemented.

During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using `reduce()` methods\n4. **MISSING LOGIC**: No reduction path exists between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations\n5. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n**Precise Fix Locations Required:**\n\n1. **Primary Fix - Lines 620-624**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`\n   - **Current**: Only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with `AddIndex` operations\n\n2. **Secondary Fix - Lines 639-648**: `AlterIndexTogether` class\n   - **Current**: Inherits standard reduction logic\n   - **Needed**: Custom `reduce()` method to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Supporting Fix - Lines 864-867**: `AddIndex.reduce()` method\n   - **Current**: Only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` from the reverse direction\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n- Add logic to detect when `AlterIndexTogether` operations can be replaced by equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects during reduction\n- Ensure the conversion maintains the same database schema effect while eliminating deprecation warnings\n- Handle edge cases like partial overlaps, field renames, and complex index configurations\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the complete root cause and exact fix locations.

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations, the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` doesn't properly remove deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being reduced/optimized with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Current Reduction Logic**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` only reduces with operations of the same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **What Should Happen**: During squashing, `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations to eliminate deprecation warnings.\n\n4. **The Fix Location**: I need to modify the reduction logic in `AlterIndexTogether` or `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations.\n\nLet me examine the rest of the `AddIndex.reduce()` method to see its complete implementation.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 860, \"end_line\": 890 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 860-890:\n\n 860:     @property\n 861:     def migration_name_fragment(self):\n 862:         return \"%s_%s\" % (self.model_name_lower, self.index.name.lower())\n 863: \n 864:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 865:         if isinstance(operation, RemoveIndex) and self.index.name == operation.name:\n 866:             return []\n 867:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n 868: \n 869: \n 870: class RemoveIndex(IndexOperation):\n 871:     \"\"\"Remove an index from a model.\"\"\"\n 872: \n 873:     def __init__(self, model_name, name):\n 874:         self.model_name = model_name\n 875:         self.name = name\n 876: \n 877:     def state_forwards(self, app_label, state):\n 878:         state.remove_index(app_label, self.model_name_lower, self.name)\n 879: \n 880:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 881:         model = from_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)\n 882:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):\n 883:             from_model_state = from_state.models[app_label, self.model_name_lower]\n 884:             index = from_model_state.get_index_by_name(self.name)\n 885:             schema_editor.remove_index(model, index)\n 886: \n 887:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 888:         model = to_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)\n 889:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):\n 890:             to_model_state = to_state.models[app_label, self.model_name_lower]\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and can identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used (deprecated)\n2. `AddIndex` operations are generated when `indexes` is used (modern approach)\n3. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using the `reduce()` method\n4. `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` which only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n5. There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n6. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing persistent deprecation warnings\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class needs enhanced reduction logic to:\n1. Detect when it can be reduced with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n2. Convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects\n3. Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operation\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my investigation, I can identify the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 620-624** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method\nThis method currently only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. It needs to be enhanced to also allow reduction with `AddIndex` operations when the operation is `AlterIndexTogether`.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 639-648** - `AlterIndexTogether` class definition  \nThis class needs a custom `reduce()` method to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations by converting `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 464-470** - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method\nThis base method may need modification to support the new reduction logic for `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 562-579** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.__init__()` and related methods\nThese may need updates to support the conversion logic from `index_together` format to `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 864-867** - `AddIndex.reduce()` method\nThis method may need enhancement to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the other direction.\n\nThe bug manifests in the migration squashing process where `AlterIndexTogether` operations (which generate deprecation warnings) aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, leaving the deprecated operations in the squashed migration files.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my comprehensive investigation, I have identified the root cause of the bug where squashing migrations with `Meta.index_together` -> `Meta.indexes` transition doesn't remove deprecation warnings. The issue is that the migration optimizer lacks the logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` operations with equivalent `AddIndex` operations during the squashing process.\n\nHere are the precise locations that need to be fixed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 639,\n            \"end_line\": 648\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 620,\n            \"end_line\": 624\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 464,\n            \"end_line\": 470\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 864,\n            \"end_line\": 867\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 562,\n            \"end_line\": 579\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Root Cause Summary:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648) inherits reduction logic that only works with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. During migration squashing, when `AlterIndexTogether` operations encounter equivalent `AddIndex` operations, they cannot be reduced together, leaving the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in the squashed migration files, which continue to generate deprecation warnings.\n\nThe fix requires enhancing the reduction logic in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) and potentially adding a custom `reduce()` method to `AlterIndexTogether` to convert deprecated `index_together` operations into equivalent `AddIndex` operations during the squashing process.\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem is exactly what I identified:\n\n**Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate the deprecation warnings because it can't properly reduce/optimize `AlterIndexTogether` operations with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings without manually rewriting their migrations, which defeats the purpose of the squashing feature.\n\n**Root Cause**: The migration optimizer lacks the logic to convert deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations into equivalent `AddIndex` operations during squashing.\n\nNow let me examine the specific code locations to understand exactly what needs to be modified to implement the fix.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 639, \"end_line\": 648 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 639-648:\n\n 639: class AlterIndexTogether(AlterTogetherOptionOperation):\n 640:     \"\"\"\n 641:     Change the value of index_together to the target one.\n 642:     Input value of index_together must be a set of tuples.\n 643:     \"\"\"\n 644: \n 645:     option_name = \"index_together\"\n 646: \n 647:     def __init__(self, name, index_together):\n 648:         super().__init__(name, index_together)\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clear view of the `AlterIndexTogether` class. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **What this code does**: The `AlterIndexTogether` class is a simple subclass of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` that handles changes to the `index_together` Meta option. It just sets `option_name = \"index_together\"` and calls the parent constructor.\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This class is responsible for generating migration operations when `index_together` is used. During squashing, these operations persist because there's no logic to convert them to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, causing deprecation warnings to remain.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is one of the core locations where the fix needs to be implemented. The class needs enhanced reduction logic to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations.\n\nNow let me examine the parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method to understand the current reduction logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 620, \"end_line\": 624 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 620-624:\n\n 620:     def can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label):\n 621:         return super().can_reduce_through(operation, app_label) or (\n 622:             isinstance(operation, AlterTogetherOptionOperation)\n 623:             and type(operation) is not type(self)\n 624:         )\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1. What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nSquashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> indexes transition should remove deprecation warnings.\nDescription\n\t\nSquashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> Meta.indexes transition should remove deprecation warnings. As far as I'm aware, it's a 4.2 release blocker because you cannot get rid of the index_together deprecation warnings without rewriting migrations, see comment.\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I can see the current reduction logic in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`. Let me analyze this:\n\n1. **What this code does**: This method determines whether two operations can be reduced together during migration squashing. It allows reduction with:\n   - Any operation that the parent class allows\n   - Other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` instances that are of a different type\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This is the core limitation causing the bug. The method only allows `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types, but NOT with `AddIndex` operations. This means when squashing migrations that transition from `index_together` to `indexes`, the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is the primary location where the fix needs to be implemented. The logic needs to be enhanced to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\nNow let me examine the `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method to understand the broader reduction framework.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 464, \"end_line\": 470 }",

During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using `reduce()` methods\n4. **MISSING LOGIC**: No reduction path exists between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations\n5. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n**Precise Fix Locations Required:**\n\n1. **Primary Fix - Lines 620-624**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`\n   - **Current**: Only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with `AddIndex` operations\n\n2. **Secondary Fix - Lines 639-648**: `AlterIndexTogether` class\n   - **Current**: Inherits standard reduction logic\n   - **Needed**: Custom `reduce()` method to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Supporting Fix - Lines 864-867**: `AddIndex.reduce()` method\n   - **Current**: Only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` from the reverse direction\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n- Add logic to detect when `AlterIndexTogether` operations can be replaced by equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects during reduction\n- Ensure the conversion maintains the same database schema effect while eliminating deprecation warnings\n- Handle edge cases like partial overlaps, field renames, and complex index configurations\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the complete root cause and exact fix locations.

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations, the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` doesn't properly remove deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being reduced/optimized with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Current Reduction Logic**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` only reduces with operations of the same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **What Should Happen**: During squashing, `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations to eliminate deprecation warnings.\n\n4. **The Fix Location**: I need to modify the reduction logic in `AlterIndexTogether` or `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations.\n\nLet me examine the rest of the `AddIndex.reduce()` method to see its complete implementation.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 860, \"end_line\": 890 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 860-890:\n\n 860:     @property\n 861:     def migration_name_fragment(self):\n 862:         return \"%s_%s\" % (self.model_name_lower, self.index.name.lower())\n 863: \n 864:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 865:         if isinstance(operation, RemoveIndex) and self.index.name == operation.name:\n 866:             return []\n 867:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n 868: \n 869: \n 870: class RemoveIndex(IndexOperation):\n 871:     \"\"\"Remove an index from a model.\"\"\"\n 872: \n 873:     def __init__(self, model_name, name):\n 874:         self.model_name = model_name\n 875:         self.name = name\n 876: \n 877:     def state_forwards(self, app_label, state):\n 878:         state.remove_index(app_label, self.model_name_lower, self.name)\n 879: \n 880:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 881:         model = from_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)\n 882:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):\n 883:             from_model_state = from_state.models[app_label, self.model_name_lower]\n 884:             index = from_model_state.get_index_by_name(self.name)\n 885:             schema_editor.remove_index(model, index)\n 886: \n 887:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 888:         model = to_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)\n 889:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):\n 890:             to_model_state = to_state.models[app_label, self.model_name_lower]\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and can identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used (deprecated)\n2. `AddIndex` operations are generated when `indexes` is used (modern approach)\n3. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using the `reduce()` method\n4. `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` which only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n5. There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n6. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing persistent deprecation warnings\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class needs enhanced reduction logic to:\n1. Detect when it can be reduced with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n2. Convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects\n3. Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operation\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my investigation, I can identify the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 620-624** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method\nThis method currently only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. It needs to be enhanced to also allow reduction with `AddIndex` operations when the operation is `AlterIndexTogether`.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 639-648** - `AlterIndexTogether` class definition  \nThis class needs a custom `reduce()` method to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations by converting `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 464-470** - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method\nThis base method may need modification to support the new reduction logic for `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 562-579** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.__init__()` and related methods\nThese may need updates to support the conversion logic from `index_together` format to `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 864-867** - `AddIndex.reduce()` method\nThis method may need enhancement to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the other direction.\n\nThe bug manifests in the migration squashing process where `AlterIndexTogether` operations (which generate deprecation warnings) aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, leaving the deprecated operations in the squashed migration files.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my comprehensive investigation, I have identified the root cause of the bug where squashing migrations with `Meta.index_together` -> `Meta.indexes` transition doesn't remove deprecation warnings. The issue is that the migration optimizer lacks the logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` operations with equivalent `AddIndex` operations during the squashing process.\n\nHere are the precise locations that need to be fixed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 639,\n            \"end_line\": 648\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 620,\n            \"end_line\": 624\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 464,\n            \"end_line\": 470\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 864,\n            \"end_line\": 867\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 562,\n            \"end_line\": 579\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Root Cause Summary:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648) inherits reduction logic that only works with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. During migration squashing, when `AlterIndexTogether` operations encounter equivalent `AddIndex` operations, they cannot be reduced together, leaving the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in the squashed migration files, which continue to generate deprecation warnings.\n\nThe fix requires enhancing the reduction logic in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) and potentially adding a custom `reduce()` method to `AlterIndexTogether` to convert deprecated `index_together` operations into equivalent `AddIndex` operations during the squashing process.\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem is exactly what I identified:\n\n**Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate the deprecation warnings because it can't properly reduce/optimize `AlterIndexTogether` operations with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings without manually rewriting their migrations, which defeats the purpose of the squashing feature.\n\n**Root Cause**: The migration optimizer lacks the logic to convert deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations into equivalent `AddIndex` operations during squashing.\n\nNow let me examine the specific code locations to understand exactly what needs to be modified to implement the fix.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 639, \"end_line\": 648 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 639-648:\n\n 639: class AlterIndexTogether(AlterTogetherOptionOperation):\n 640:     \"\"\"\n 641:     Change the value of index_together to the target one.\n 642:     Input value of index_together must be a set of tuples.\n 643:     \"\"\"\n 644: \n 645:     option_name = \"index_together\"\n 646: \n 647:     def __init__(self, name, index_together):\n 648:         super().__init__(name, index_together)\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clear view of the `AlterIndexTogether` class. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **What this code does**: The `AlterIndexTogether` class is a simple subclass of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` that handles changes to the `index_together` Meta option. It just sets `option_name = \"index_together\"` and calls the parent constructor.\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This class is responsible for generating migration operations when `index_together` is used. During squashing, these operations persist because there's no logic to convert them to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, causing deprecation warnings to remain.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is one of the core locations where the fix needs to be implemented. The class needs enhanced reduction logic to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations.\n\nNow let me examine the parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method to understand the current reduction logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 620, \"end_line\": 624 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 620-624:\n\n 620:     def can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label):\n 621:         return super().can_reduce_through(operation, app_label) or (\n 622:             isinstance(operation, AlterTogetherOptionOperation)\n 623:             and type(operation) is not type(self)\n 624:         )\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I can see the current reduction logic in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`. Let me analyze this:\n\n1. **What this code does**: This method determines whether two operations can be reduced together during migration squashing. It allows reduction with:\n   - Any operation that the parent class allows\n   - Other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` instances that are of a different type\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This is the core limitation causing the bug. The method only allows `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types, but NOT with `AddIndex` operations. This means when squashing migrations that transition from `index_together` to `indexes`, the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is the primary location where the fix needs to be implemented. The logic needs to be enhanced to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\nNow let me examine the `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method to understand the broader reduction framework.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 464, \"end_line\": 470 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 464-470:\n\n 464:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 465:         if (\n 466:             isinstance(operation, (self.__class__, DeleteModel))\n 467:             and self.name_lower == operation.name_lower\n 468:         ):\n 469:             return [operation]\n 470:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1.

    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I have a comprehensive understanding of the reduction framework.

During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using `reduce()` methods\n4. **MISSING LOGIC**: No reduction path exists between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations\n5. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n**Precise Fix Locations Required:**\n\n1. **Primary Fix - Lines 620-624**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`\n   - **Current**: Only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with `AddIndex` operations\n\n2. **Secondary Fix - Lines 639-648**: `AlterIndexTogether` class\n   - **Current**: Inherits standard reduction logic\n   - **Needed**: Custom `reduce()` method to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Supporting Fix - Lines 864-867**: `AddIndex.reduce()` method\n   - **Current**: Only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` from the reverse direction\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n- Add logic to detect when `AlterIndexTogether` operations can be replaced by equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects during reduction\n- Ensure the conversion maintains the same database schema effect while eliminating deprecation warnings\n- Handle edge cases like partial overlaps, field renames, and complex index configurations\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the complete root cause and exact fix locations. The bug is a missing reduction capability in the migration squashing system that prevents proper optimization of the `index_together` → `indexes` transition.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 639\nEnd line: 648\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 620\nEnd line: 624\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 464\nEnd line: 470\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 864\nEnd line: 867\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 562\nEnd line: 579\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations, the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` doesn't properly remove deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being reduced/optimized with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Current Reduction Logic**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` only reduces with operations of the same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **What Should Happen**: During squashing, `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations to eliminate deprecation warnings.\n\n4. **The Fix Location**: I need to modify the reduction logic in `AlterIndexTogether` or `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations.\n\nLet me examine the rest of the `AddIndex.reduce()` method to see its complete implementation.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 860, \"end_line\": 890 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 860-890:\n\n 860:     @property\n 861:     def migration_name_fragment(self):\n 862:         return \"%s_%s\" % (self.model_name_lower, self.index.name.lower())\n 863: \n 864:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 865:         if isinstance(operation, RemoveIndex) and self.index.name == operation.name:\n 866:             return []\n 867:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n 868: \n 869: \n 870: class RemoveIndex(IndexOperation):\n 871:     \"\"\"Remove an index from a model.\"\"\"\n 872: \n 873:     def __init__(self, model_name, name):\n 874:         self.model_name = model_name\n 875:         self.name = name\n 876: \n 877:     def state_forwards(self, app_label, state):\n 878:         state.remove_index(app_label, self.model_name_lower, self.name)\n 879: \n 880:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 881:         model = from_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)\n 882:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):\n 883:             from_model_state = from_state.models[app_label, self.model_name_lower]\n 884:             index = from_model_state.get_index_by_name(self.name)\n 885:             schema_editor.remove_index(model, index)\n 886: \n 887:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 888:         model = to_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)\n 889:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):\n 890:             to_model_state = to_state.models[app_label, self.model_name_lower]\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and can identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used (deprecated)\n2. `AddIndex` operations are generated when `indexes` is used (modern approach)\n3. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using the `reduce()` method\n4. `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` which only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n5. There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n6. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing persistent deprecation warnings\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class needs enhanced reduction logic to:\n1. Detect when it can be reduced with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n2. Convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects\n3. Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operation\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my investigation, I can identify the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 620-624** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method\nThis method currently only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. It needs to be enhanced to also allow reduction with `AddIndex` operations when the operation is `AlterIndexTogether`.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 639-648** - `AlterIndexTogether` class definition  \nThis class needs a custom `reduce()` method to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations by converting `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 464-470** - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method\nThis base method may need modification to support the new reduction logic for `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 562-579** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.__init__()` and related methods\nThese may need updates to support the conversion logic from `index_together` format to `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 864-867** - `AddIndex.reduce()` method\nThis method may need enhancement to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the other direction.\n\nThe bug manifests in the migration squashing process where `AlterIndexTogether` operations (which generate deprecation warnings) aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, leaving the deprecated operations in the squashed migration files.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my comprehensive investigation, I have identified the root cause of the bug where squashing migrations with `Meta.index_together` -> `Meta.indexes` transition doesn't remove deprecation warnings. The issue is that the migration optimizer lacks the logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` operations with equivalent `AddIndex` operations during the squashing process.\n\nHere are the precise locations that need to be fixed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 639,\n            \"end_line\": 648\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 620,\n            \"end_line\": 624\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 464,\n            \"end_line\": 470\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 864,\n            \"end_line\": 867\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 562,\n            \"end_line\": 579\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Root Cause Summary:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648) inherits reduction logic that only works with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. During migration squashing, when `AlterIndexTogether` operations encounter equivalent `AddIndex` operations, they cannot be reduced together, leaving the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in the squashed migration files, which continue to generate deprecation warnings.\n\nThe fix requires enhancing the reduction logic in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) and potentially adding a custom `reduce()` method to `AlterIndexTogether` to convert deprecated `index_together` operations into equivalent `AddIndex` operations during the squashing process.\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem is exactly what I identified:\n\n**Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate the deprecation warnings because it can't properly reduce/optimize `AlterIndexTogether` operations with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings without manually rewriting their migrations, which defeats the purpose of the squashing feature.\n\n**Root Cause**: The migration optimizer lacks the logic to convert deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations into equivalent `AddIndex` operations during squashing.\n\nNow let me examine the specific code locations to understand exactly what needs to be modified to implement the fix.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 639, \"end_line\": 648 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 639-648:\n\n 639: class AlterIndexTogether(AlterTogetherOptionOperation):\n 640:     \"\"\"\n 641:     Change the value of index_together to the target one.\n 642:     Input value of index_together must be a set of tuples.\n 643:     \"\"\"\n 644: \n 645:     option_name = \"index_together\"\n 646: \n 647:     def __init__(self, name, index_together):\n 648:         super().__init__(name, index_together)\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clear view of the `AlterIndexTogether` class. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **What this code does**: The `AlterIndexTogether` class is a simple subclass of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` that handles changes to the `index_together` Meta option. It just sets `option_name = \"index_together\"` and calls the parent constructor.\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This class is responsible for generating migration operations when `index_together` is used. During squashing, these operations persist because there's no logic to convert them to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, causing deprecation warnings to remain.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is one of the core locations where the fix needs to be implemented. The class needs enhanced reduction logic to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations.\n\nNow let me examine the parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method to understand the current reduction logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 620, \"end_line\": 624 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 620-624:\n\n 620:     def can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label):\n 621:         return super().can_reduce_through(operation, app_label) or (\n 622:             isinstance(operation, AlterTogetherOptionOperation)\n 623:             and type(operation) is not type(self)\n 624:         )\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I can see the current reduction logic in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`. Let me analyze this:\n\n1. **What this code does**: This method determines whether two operations can be reduced together during migration squashing. It allows reduction with:\n   - Any operation that the parent class allows\n   - Other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` instances that are of a different type\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This is the core limitation causing the bug. The method only allows `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types, but NOT with `AddIndex` operations. This means when squashing migrations that transition from `index_together` to `indexes`, the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is the primary location where the fix needs to be implemented. The logic needs to be enhanced to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\nNow let me examine the `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method to understand the broader reduction framework.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 464, \"end_line\": 470 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 464-470:\n\n 464:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 465:         if (\n 466:             isinstance(operation, (self.__class__, DeleteModel))\n 467:             and self.name_lower == operation.name_lower\n 468:         ):\n 469:             return [operation]\n 470:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a comprehensive understanding of the reduction framework. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **What this code does**: `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` is the base reduction method that only allows reduction with operations of the same class or `DeleteModel` operations targeting the same model.\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This restrictive reduction logic prevents `AlterIndexTogether` from reducing with `AddIndex` operations because they're different classes, even though they can represent equivalent database changes.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is part of the inheritance chain that limits reduction capabilities. The fix will need to work within or override this framework.\n\nNow let me examine the `AddIndex.reduce()` method to understand how it currently handles reductions.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 864, \"end_line\": 867 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 864-867:\n\n 864:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 865:         if isinstance(operation, RemoveIndex) and self.index.name == operation.name:\n 866:             return []\n 867:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1.

During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using `reduce()` methods\n4. **MISSING LOGIC**: No reduction path exists between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations\n5.

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations, the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` doesn't properly remove deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being reduced/optimized with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Current Reduction Logic**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` only reduces with operations of the same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **What Should Happen**: During squashing, `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations to eliminate deprecation warnings.\n\n4. **The Fix Location**: I need to modify the reduction logic in `AlterIndexTogether` or `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations.\n\nLet me examine the rest of the `AddIndex.reduce()` method to see its complete implementation.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 860, \"end_line\": 890 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 860-890:\n\n 860:     @property\n 861:     def migration_name_fragment(self):\n 862:         return \"%s_%s\" % (self.model_name_lower, self.index.name.lower())\n 863: \n 864:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 865:         if isinstance(operation, RemoveIndex) and self.index.name == operation.name:\n 866:             return []\n 867:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n 868: \n 869: \n 870: class RemoveIndex(IndexOperation):\n 871:     \"\"\"Remove an index from a model.\"\"\"\n 872: \n 873:     def __init__(self, model_name, name):\n 874:         self.model_name = model_name\n 875:         self.name = name\n 876: \n 877:     def state_forwards(self, app_label, state):\n 878:         state.remove_index(app_label, self.model_name_lower, self.name)\n 879: \n 880:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 881:         model = from_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)\n 882:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):\n 883:             from_model_state = from_state.models[app_label, self.model_name_lower]\n 884:             index = from_model_state.get_index_by_name(self.name)\n 885:             schema_editor.remove_index(model, index)\n 886: \n 887:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 888:         model = to_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)\n 889:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):\n 890:             to_model_state = to_state.models[app_label, self.model_name_lower]\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and can identify the precise locations that need to be fixed.

During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using the `reduce()` method\n4. `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` which only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n5. There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n6. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing persistent deprecation warnings\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class needs enhanced reduction logic to:\n1. Detect when it can be reduced with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n2. Convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects\n3. Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operation\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my investigation, I can identify the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 620-624** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method\nThis method currently only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types.

The issue is that the migration optimizer lacks the logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` operations with equivalent `AddIndex` operations during the squashing process.\n\nHere are the precise locations that need to be fixed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 639,\n            \"end_line\": 648\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 620,\n            \"end_line\": 624\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 464,\n            \"end_line\": 470\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 864,\n            \"end_line\": 867\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 562,\n            \"end_line\": 579\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Root Cause Summary:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648) inherits reduction logic that only works with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. During migration squashing, when `AlterIndexTogether` operations encounter equivalent `AddIndex` operations, they cannot be reduced together, leaving the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in the squashed migration files, which continue to generate deprecation warnings.\n\nThe fix requires enhancing the reduction logic in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) and potentially adding a custom `reduce()` method to `AlterIndexTogether` to convert deprecated `index_together` operations into equivalent `AddIndex` operations during the squashing process.\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem is exactly what I identified:\n\n**Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate the deprecation warnings because it can't properly reduce/optimize `AlterIndexTogether` operations with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings without manually rewriting their migrations, which defeats the purpose of the squashing feature.\n\n**Root Cause**: The migration optimizer lacks the logic to convert deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations into equivalent `AddIndex` operations during squashing.\n\nNow let me examine the specific code locations to understand exactly what needs to be modified to implement the fix.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 639, \"end_line\": 648 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 639-648:\n\n 639: class AlterIndexTogether(AlterTogetherOptionOperation):\n 640:     \"\"\"\n 641:     Change the value of index_together to the target one.\n 642:     Input value of index_together must be a set of tuples.\n 643:     \"\"\"\n 644: \n 645:     option_name = \"index_together\"\n 646: \n 647:     def __init__(self, name, index_together):\n 648:         super().__init__(name, index_together)\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clear view of the `AlterIndexTogether` class. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **What this code does**: The `AlterIndexTogether` class is a simple subclass of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` that handles changes to the `index_together` Meta option. It just sets `option_name = \"index_together\"` and calls the parent constructor.\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This class is responsible for generating migration operations when `index_together` is used. During squashing, these operations persist because there's no logic to convert them to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, causing deprecation warnings to remain.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is one of the core locations where the fix needs to be implemented. The class needs enhanced reduction logic to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations.\n\nNow let me examine the parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method to understand the current reduction logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 620, \"end_line\": 624 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 620-624:\n\n 620:     def can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label):\n 621:         return super().can_reduce_through(operation, app_label) or (\n 622:             isinstance(operation, AlterTogetherOptionOperation)\n 623:             and type(operation) is not type(self)\n 624:         )\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I can see the current reduction logic in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`. Let me analyze this:\n\n1. **What this code does**: This method determines whether two operations can be reduced together during migration squashing. It allows reduction with:\n   - Any operation that the parent class allows\n   - Other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` instances that are of a different type\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This is the core limitation causing the bug. The method only allows `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types, but NOT with `AddIndex` operations. This means when squashing migrations that transition from `index_together` to `indexes`, the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is the primary location where the fix needs to be implemented. The logic needs to be enhanced to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\nNow let me examine the `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method to understand the broader reduction framework.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 464, \"end_line\": 470 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 464-470:\n\n 464:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 465:         if (\n 466:             isinstance(operation, (self.__class__, DeleteModel))\n 467:             and self.name_lower == operation.name_lower\n 468:         ):\n 469:             return [operation]\n 470:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a comprehensive understanding of the reduction framework.

The fix will need to work within or override this framework.\n\nNow let me examine the `AddIndex.reduce()` method to understand how it currently handles reductions.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 864, \"end_line\": 867 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 864-867:\n\n 864:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 865:         if isinstance(operation, RemoveIndex) and self.index.name == operation.name:\n 866:             return []\n 867:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have examined all the key locations and have a complete understanding of the bug.

This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations. This supports the transformation needed in the `AlterIndexTogether.reduce()` method.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**: The fix should prioritize eliminating deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in favor of modern `AddIndex` operations during squashing, while maintaining identical database schema effects. The conversion logic should handle field name resolution, index naming conventions, and ensure the resulting squashed migration produces the same final database state without deprecation warnings.",

Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n### 7. Autodetector Method Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `generate_removed_altered_index_together` method in `autodetector.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Method calls `_generate_removed_altered_foo_together(operations.AlterIndexTogether)`\n  - Generic method handles both `unique_together` and `index_together`\n  - Lines 1520-1569 show the implementation uses `AlterIndexTogether` operations\n\n### 8.

AlterTogetherOptionOperation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: Lines 530-630 of `/operations/models.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**:\n  - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` has a `can_reduce_through()` method (lines 620-624)\n  - Method allows reduction between different types of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n  - **BUT**: No specific logic found for reducing `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n### 10. **NEW**: Reduction Logic Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `reduce` methods in `/operations/models.py`\n- **Critical Findings**:\n  - `ModelOperation.reduce()` (lines 32-35): Base method that calls `can_reduce_through()`\n  - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470): Only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n  - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867): Can reduce with `RemoveIndex` operations\n  - **CRITICAL**: No cross-operation reduction between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex`\n\n### 11. **NEW**: AddIndex Operation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `AddIndex` class implementation (lines 811-867)\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `AddIndex` inherits from `IndexOperation`\n  - Requires named indexes (line 816-820)\n  - Has `state_forwards()`, `database_forwards()`, and `reduce()` methods\n  - Only reduces with `RemoveIndex` operations, not with `AlterIndexTogether`\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n- Located the exact `AlterIndexTogether` operation class and its parent\n- Identified that `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` handles reduction logic\n- Confirmed the inheritance hierarchy: `AlterIndexTogether` → `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` → `ModelOptionOperation` → `ModelOperation` → `Operation`\n- **NEW**: Analyzed all relevant `reduce()` methods in the migration operations\n- **NEW**: Examined `AddIndex` operation implementation and its reduction capabilities\n- **NEW**: Confirmed the exact locations where the bug manifests\n\n### 🔄 In Progress  \n- **READY FOR FIX**: All investigation complete, root cause identified, fix locations determined\n\n### ❌ Issues Identified - **ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED**\n- **CRITICAL BUG LOCATION**: The reduction logic in migration squashing doesn't handle the transition from `AlterIndexTogether` to `AddIndex` operations\n- **Specific Problem**: \n  1. `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n  2. `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n  3. `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n  4. **NO LOGIC EXISTS** to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- **Result**: Deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing persistent deprecation warnings\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions, specifically:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648)\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` parent class (lines 562-624)\n   - `ModelOptionOperation` base class (lines 463-470)\n   - `AddIndex` class (lines 811-867)\n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization during squashing\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n- `can_reduce_through()` method controls which operations can be reduced together during squashing\n- **NEW**: Reduction logic is hierarchical: `reduce()` → `can_reduce_through()` → operation-specific logic\n\n### **PROPOSE LOCATION** - Root Cause Analysis & Fix Locations\n\n**The bug occurs because:**\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used (deprecated)\n2. `AddIndex` operations are generated when `indexes` is used (modern approach)\n3. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using `reduce()` methods\n4. **MISSING LOGIC**: No reduction path exists between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations\n5. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n**Precise Fix Locations Required:**\n\n1. **Primary Fix - Lines 620-624**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`\n   - **Current**: Only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with `AddIndex` operations\n\n2. **Secondary Fix - Lines 639-648**: `AlterIndexTogether` class\n   - **Current**: Inherits standard reduction logic\n   - **Needed**: Custom `reduce()` method to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Supporting Fix - Lines 864-867**: `AddIndex.reduce()` method\n   - **Current**: Only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` from the reverse direction\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n- Add logic to detect when `AlterIndexTogether` operations can be replaced by equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects during reduction\n- Ensure the conversion maintains the same database schema effect while eliminating deprecation warnings\n- Handle edge cases like partial overlaps, field renames, and complex index configurations\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the complete root cause and exact fix locations. The bug is a missing reduction capability in the migration squashing system that prevents proper optimization of the `index_together` → `indexes` transition.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations, the transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` doesn't properly remove deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations aren't being reduced/optimized with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Current Reduction Logic**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` only reduces with operations of the same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **What Should Happen**: During squashing, `AlterIndexTogether` operations should be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations to eliminate deprecation warnings.\n\n4. **The Fix Location**: I need to modify the reduction logic in `AlterIndexTogether` or `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations.\n\nLet me examine the rest of the `AddIndex.reduce()` method to see its complete implementation.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 860, \"end_line\": 890 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 860-890:\n\n 860:     @property\n 861:     def migration_name_fragment(self):\n 862:         return \"%s_%s\" % (self.model_name_lower, self.index.name.lower())\n 863: \n 864:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 865:         if isinstance(operation, RemoveIndex) and self.index.name == operation.name:\n 866:             return []\n 867:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n 868: \n 869: \n 870: class RemoveIndex(IndexOperation):\n 871:     \"\"\"Remove an index from a model.\"\"\"\n 872: \n 873:     def __init__(self, model_name, name):\n 874:         self.model_name = model_name\n 875:         self.name = name\n 876: \n 877:     def state_forwards(self, app_label, state):\n 878:         state.remove_index(app_label, self.model_name_lower, self.name)\n 879: \n 880:     def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 881:         model = from_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)\n 882:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):\n 883:             from_model_state = from_state.models[app_label, self.model_name_lower]\n 884:             index = from_model_state.get_index_by_name(self.name)\n 885:             schema_editor.remove_index(model, index)\n 886: \n 887:     def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):\n 888:         model = to_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.model_name)\n 889:         if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, model):\n 890:             to_model_state = to_state.models[app_label, self.model_name_lower]\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and can identify the precise locations that need to be fixed. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used (deprecated)\n2. `AddIndex` operations are generated when `indexes` is used (modern approach)\n3. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using the `reduce()` method\n4. `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` which only allows reduction with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n5. There's no logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n6. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing persistent deprecation warnings\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class needs enhanced reduction logic to:\n1. Detect when it can be reduced with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n2. Convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects\n3. Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operation\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my investigation, I can identify the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n**Location 1: Lines 620-624** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method\nThis method currently only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. It needs to be enhanced to also allow reduction with `AddIndex` operations when the operation is `AlterIndexTogether`.\n\n**Location 2: Lines 639-648** - `AlterIndexTogether` class definition  \nThis class needs a custom `reduce()` method to handle reduction with `AddIndex` operations by converting `index_together` tuples to equivalent `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 3: Lines 464-470** - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method\nThis base method may need modification to support the new reduction logic for `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Location 4: Lines 562-579** - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.__init__()` and related methods\nThese may need updates to support the conversion logic from `index_together` format to `Index` objects.\n\n**Location 5: Lines 864-867** - `AddIndex.reduce()` method\nThis method may need enhancement to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the other direction.\n\nThe bug manifests in the migration squashing process where `AlterIndexTogether` operations (which generate deprecation warnings) aren't being properly converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, leaving the deprecated operations in the squashed migration files.\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: **PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my comprehensive investigation, I have identified the root cause of the bug where squashing migrations with `Meta.index_together` -> `Meta.indexes` transition doesn't remove deprecation warnings. The issue is that the migration optimizer lacks the logic to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` operations with equivalent `AddIndex` operations during the squashing process.\n\nHere are the precise locations that need to be fixed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 639,\n            \"end_line\": 648\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 620,\n            \"end_line\": 624\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 464,\n            \"end_line\": 470\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 864,\n            \"end_line\": 867\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 562,\n            \"end_line\": 579\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Root Cause Summary:**\nThe `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648) inherits reduction logic that only works with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types. During migration squashing, when `AlterIndexTogether` operations encounter equivalent `AddIndex` operations, they cannot be reduced together, leaving the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in the squashed migration files, which continue to generate deprecation warnings.\n\nThe fix requires enhancing the reduction logic in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) and potentially adding a custom `reduce()` method to `AlterIndexTogether` to convert deprecated `index_together` operations into equivalent `AddIndex` operations during the squashing process.\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem is exactly what I identified:\n\n**Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate the deprecation warnings because it can't properly reduce/optimize `AlterIndexTogether` operations with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n**Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings without manually rewriting their migrations, which defeats the purpose of the squashing feature.\n\n**Root Cause**: The migration optimizer lacks the logic to convert deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations into equivalent `AddIndex` operations during squashing.\n\nNow let me examine the specific code locations to understand exactly what needs to be modified to implement the fix.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 639, \"end_line\": 648 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 639-648:\n\n 639: class AlterIndexTogether(AlterTogetherOptionOperation):\n 640:     \"\"\"\n 641:     Change the value of index_together to the target one.\n 642:     Input value of index_together must be a set of tuples.\n 643:     \"\"\"\n 644: \n 645:     option_name = \"index_together\"\n 646: \n 647:     def __init__(self, name, index_together):\n 648:         super().__init__(name, index_together)\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a clear view of the `AlterIndexTogether` class. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **What this code does**: The `AlterIndexTogether` class is a simple subclass of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` that handles changes to the `index_together` Meta option. It just sets `option_name = \"index_together\"` and calls the parent constructor.\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This class is responsible for generating migration operations when `index_together` is used. During squashing, these operations persist because there's no logic to convert them to equivalent `AddIndex` operations, causing deprecation warnings to remain.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is one of the core locations where the fix needs to be implemented. The class needs enhanced reduction logic to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations.\n\nNow let me examine the parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` method to understand the current reduction logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 620, \"end_line\": 624 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 620-624:\n\n 620:     def can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label):\n 621:         return super().can_reduce_through(operation, app_label) or (\n 622:             isinstance(operation, AlterTogetherOptionOperation)\n 623:             and type(operation) is not type(self)\n 624:         )\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I can see the current reduction logic in `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`. Let me analyze this:\n\n1. **What this code does**: This method determines whether two operations can be reduced together during migration squashing. It allows reduction with:\n   - Any operation that the parent class allows\n   - Other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` instances that are of a different type\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This is the core limitation causing the bug. The method only allows `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with other `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types, but NOT with `AddIndex` operations. This means when squashing migrations that transition from `index_together` to `indexes`, the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is the primary location where the fix needs to be implemented. The logic needs to be enhanced to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\nNow let me examine the `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method to understand the broader reduction framework.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 464, \"end_line\": 470 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 464-470:\n\n 464:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 465:         if (\n 466:             isinstance(operation, (self.__class__, DeleteModel))\n 467:             and self.name_lower == operation.name_lower\n 468:         ):\n 469:             return [operation]\n 470:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a comprehensive understanding of the reduction framework. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **What this code does**: `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` is the base reduction method that only allows reduction with operations of the same class or `DeleteModel` operations targeting the same model.\n\n2. **How it influences the failing test**: This restrictive reduction logic prevents `AlterIndexTogether` from reducing with `AddIndex` operations because they're different classes, even though they can represent equivalent database changes.\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**: This is part of the inheritance chain that limits reduction capabilities. The fix will need to work within or override this framework.\n\nNow let me examine the `AddIndex.reduce()` method to understand how it currently handles reductions.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 864, \"end_line\": 867 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 864-867:\n\n 864:     def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n 865:         if isinstance(operation, RemoveIndex) and self.index.name == operation.name:\n 866:             return []\n 867:         return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have examined all the key locations and have a complete understanding of the bug. Let me analyze the final piece - the `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` initialization and core methods to understand how the conversion logic should work.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\", \"start_line\": 562, \"end_line\": 579 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nTotal lines: 1142\nShowing lines 562-579:\n\n 562: class AlterTogetherOptionOperation(ModelOptionOperation):\n 563:     option_name = None\n 564: \n 565:     def __init__(self, name, option_value):\n 566:         if option_value:\n 567:             option_value = set(normalize_together(option_value))\n 568:         setattr(self, self.option_name, option_value)\n 569:         super().__init__(name)\n 570: \n 571:     @cached_property\n 572:     def option_value(self):\n 573:         return getattr(self, self.option_name)\n 574: \n 575:     def deconstruct(self):\n 576:         kwargs = {\n 577:             \"name\": self.name,\n 578:             self.option_name: self.option_value,\n 579:         }\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have all the context I need to understand the complete bug and propose comprehensive repair suggestions. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations. This method should:\n   - Detect when reducing with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n   - Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects with auto-generated names\n   - Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether`\n   - Handle edge cases like empty `index_together` values\n\n3. **[Lines 464-470] ModelOptionOperation.reduce()**: Modify this base method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to bypass the same-class restriction when reducing with `AddIndex` operations. This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations. This supports the transformation needed in the `AlterIndexTogether.reduce()` method.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**: The fix should prioritize eliminating deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in favor of modern `AddIndex` operations during squashing, while maintaining identical database schema effects. The conversion logic should handle field name resolution, index naming conventions, and ensure the resulting squashed migration produces the same final database state without deprecation warnings.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py lines 639-648\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nclass AlterIndexTogether(AlterTogetherOptionOperation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Change the value of index_together to the target one.\n    Input value of index_together must be a set of tuples.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    option_name = \"index_together\"\n\n    def __init__(self, name, index_together):\n        super().__init__(name, index_together)\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py lines 620-624\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def can_reduce_through(self, operation, app_label):\n        return super().can_reduce_through(operation, app_label) or (\n            isinstance(operation, AlterTogetherOptionOperation)\n            and type(operation) is not type(self)\n        )\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py lines 464-470\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n        if (\n            isinstance(operation, (self.__class__, DeleteModel))\n            and self.name_lower == operation.name_lower\n        ):\n            return [operation]\n        return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py lines 864-867\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def reduce(self, operation, app_label):\n        if isinstance(operation, RemoveIndex) and self.index.name == operation.name:\n            return []\n        return super().reduce(operation, app_label)\n\n\n[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py lines 562-579\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nclass AlterTogetherOptionOperation(ModelOptionOperation):\n    option_name = None\n\n    def __init__(self, name, option_value):\n        if option_value:\n            option_value = set(normalize_together(option_value))\n        setattr(self, self.option_name, option_value)\n        super().__init__(name)\n\n    @cached_property\n    def option_value(self):\n        return getattr(self, self.option_name)\n\n    def deconstruct(self):\n        kwargs = {\n            \"name\": self.name,\n            self.option_name: self.option_value,\n        }\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that:\n1.

During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using `reduce()` methods\n4. **MISSING LOGIC**: No reduction path exists between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations\n5. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n**Precise Fix Locations Required:**\n\n1. **Primary Fix - Lines 620-624**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`\n   - **Current**: Only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with `AddIndex` operations\n\n2. **Secondary Fix - Lines 639-648**: `AlterIndexTogether` class\n   - **Current**: Simple subclass with no custom reduction logic\n   - **Needed**: Custom `reduce()` method to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Supporting Fix - Lines 464-470**: `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method\n   - **Current**: Only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - **Needed**: Allow `AlterIndexTogether` to bypass same-class restriction for `AddIndex` operations\n\n4. **Reverse Fix - Lines 864-867**: `AddIndex.reduce()` method\n   - **Current**: Only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` from the reverse direction\n\n5. **Base Support - Lines 562-579**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` base class\n   - **Current**: Normalizes tuple values, provides base functionality\n   - **Needed**: Ensure proper support for conversion logic between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n- Add logic to detect when `AlterIndexTogether` operations can be replaced by equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects during reduction\n- Ensure the conversion maintains the same database schema effect while eliminating deprecation warnings\n- Handle edge cases like partial overlaps, field renames, and complex index configurations\n- Prioritize modern `AddIndex` operations over deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations during squashing\n\n## **FINAL STATUS: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the complete root cause and exact fix locations. All 5 code segments have been reviewed and confirmed ready for implementation. The bug is a missing reduction capability in the migration squashing system that prevents proper optimization of the `index_together` → `indexes` transition. The fix strategy is comprehensive and addresses all necessary locations to eliminate deprecation warnings during migration squashing.",

AddIndex Operation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `AddIndex` class implementation (lines 811-867)\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `AddIndex` inherits from `IndexOperation`\n  - Requires named indexes (line 816-820)\n  - Has `state_forwards()`, `database_forwards()`, and `reduce()` methods\n  - Only reduces with `RemoveIndex` operations, not with `AlterIndexTogether`\n\n### 12. **FINAL** Complete Code Location Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on all 5 identified locations\n- **Target**: Exact code segments that need modification\n- **Results**:\n  - **Location 1 (639-648)**: `AlterIndexTogether` class - Simple subclass with no custom reduction logic\n  - **Location 2 (620-624)**: `can_reduce_through()` - Only allows reduction between `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n  - **Location 3 (464-470)**: `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` - Restrictive same-class-only reduction\n  - **Location 4 (864-867)**: `AddIndex.reduce()` - Only handles `RemoveIndex` operations\n  - **Location 5 (562-579)**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` base class - Normalizes tuple values\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed - **INVESTIGATION COMPLETE**\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n- Located the exact `AlterIndexTogether` operation class and its parent\n- Identified that `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` handles reduction logic\n- Confirmed the inheritance hierarchy: `AlterIndexTogether` → `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` → `ModelOptionOperation` → `ModelOperation` → `Operation`\n- Analyzed all relevant `reduce()` methods in the migration operations\n- Examined `AddIndex` operation implementation and its reduction capabilities\n- **FINAL**: Confirmed the exact locations where the bug manifests and reviewed all 5 code segments\n\n### 🔄 **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**\n- **STATUS**: All investigation complete, root cause identified, fix locations confirmed\n- **DECISION**: All 5 locations are ready for fixing based on comprehensive code review\n\n### ❌ **ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED** - Bug Analysis Complete\n- **CRITICAL BUG LOCATION**: The reduction logic in migration squashing doesn't handle the transition from `AlterIndexTogether` to `AddIndex` operations\n- **Specific Problem**: \n  1. `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n  2. `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n  3. `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n  4. `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648) has no custom reduction logic\n  5. **NO LOGIC EXISTS** to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- **Result**: Deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing persistent deprecation warnings\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions, specifically:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648)\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` parent class (lines 562-624)\n   - `ModelOptionOperation` base class (lines 463-470)\n   - `AddIndex` class (lines 811-867)\n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization during squashing\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n- `can_reduce_through()` method controls which operations can be reduced together during squashing\n- Reduction logic is hierarchical: `reduce()` → `can_reduce_through()` → operation-specific logic\n- `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` normalizes tuple values using `normalize_together()`\n\n### **COMPREHENSIVE FIX STRATEGY IDENTIFIED**\n\n**The bug occurs because:**\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used (deprecated)\n2. `AddIndex` operations are generated when `indexes` is used (modern approach)\n3. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using `reduce()` methods\n4. **MISSING LOGIC**: No reduction path exists between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations\n5. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n**Precise Fix Locations Required:**\n\n1. **Primary Fix - Lines 620-624**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`\n   - **Current**: Only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with `AddIndex` operations\n\n2. **Secondary Fix - Lines 639-648**: `AlterIndexTogether` class\n   - **Current**: Simple subclass with no custom reduction logic\n   - **Needed**: Custom `reduce()` method to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Supporting Fix - Lines 464-470**: `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method\n   - **Current**: Only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - **Needed**: Allow `AlterIndexTogether` to bypass same-class restriction for `AddIndex` operations\n\n4. **Reverse Fix - Lines 864-867**: `AddIndex.reduce()` method\n   - **Current**: Only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` from the reverse direction\n\n5. **Base Support - Lines 562-579**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` base class\n   - **Current**: Normalizes tuple values, provides base functionality\n   - **Needed**: Ensure proper support for conversion logic between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n- Add logic to detect when `AlterIndexTogether` operations can be replaced by equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects during reduction\n- Ensure the conversion maintains the same database schema effect while eliminating deprecation warnings\n- Handle edge cases like partial overlaps, field renames, and complex index configurations\n- Prioritize modern `AddIndex` operations over deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations during squashing\n\n## **FINAL STATUS: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the complete root cause and exact fix locations. All 5 code segments have been reviewed and confirmed ready for implementation. The bug is a missing reduction capability in the migration squashing system that prevents proper optimization of the `index_together` → `indexes` transition. The fix strategy is comprehensive and addresses all necessary locations to eliminate deprecation warnings during migration squashing.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 639\nEnd line: 648\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 620\nEnd line: 624\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 464\nEnd line: 470\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 864\nEnd line: 867\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 562\nEnd line: 579\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nPerfect!

This is identified as a Django 4.2 release blocker.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/`\n- **Result**: Identified the main Django project structure with core directories including `django/`, `tests/`, and documentation\n\n### 2. Django Core Module Investigation  \n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/`\n- **Result**: Located key modules including `db/` which contains the migration system\n\n### 3. Migration System Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/`\n- **Result**: Found critical migration files:\n  - `optimizer.py` - Handles migration optimization/squashing\n  - `operations/` - Contains migration operation definitions\n  - `autodetector.py` - Detects model changes\n  - `state.py` - Manages migration state\n\n### 4. Migration Optimizer Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `optimizer.py` (lines 1-50)\n- **Result**: Discovered the `MigrationOptimizer` class that handles the squashing process through `optimize()` and `optimize_inner()` methods, using operation reduction logic\n\n### 5. Model Operations Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/operations/models.py` (lines 1-50)  \n- **Result**: Found `ModelOperation` and `CreateModel` classes that handle model-level operations including Meta options\n\n### 6. Index_together Code Search and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: Migration directory for \"index_together\" references\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `state.py` contains logic for handling both `index_together` and `indexes` options\n  - `autodetector.py` has methods like `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n  - Multiple references show the transition is being managed but may not be properly optimized during squashing\n\n### 7. Autodetector Method Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `generate_removed_altered_index_together` method in `autodetector.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Method calls `_generate_removed_altered_foo_together(operations.AlterIndexTogether)`\n  - Generic method handles both `unique_together` and `index_together`\n  - Lines 1520-1569 show the implementation uses `AlterIndexTogether` operations\n\n### 8. AlterIndexTogether Operation Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `AlterIndexTogether` class in `/operations/models.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `AlterIndexTogether` inherits from `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` (lines 639-648)\n  - Has `option_name = \"index_together\"`\n  - Parent class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` handles the core logic (lines 562-624)\n\n### 9. AlterTogetherOptionOperation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: Lines 530-630 of `/operations/models.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**:\n  - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` has a `can_reduce_through()` method (lines 620-624)\n  - Method allows reduction between different types of `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`\n  - **BUT**: No specific logic found for reducing `AlterIndexTogether` with `AddIndex` operations\n\n### 10. Reduction Logic Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `reduce` methods in `/operations/models.py`\n- **Critical Findings**:\n  - `ModelOperation.reduce()` (lines 32-35): Base method that calls `can_reduce_through()`\n  - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470): Only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n  - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867): Can reduce with `RemoveIndex` operations\n  - **CRITICAL**: No cross-operation reduction between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex`\n\n### 11. AddIndex Operation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `AddIndex` class implementation (lines 811-867)\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `AddIndex` inherits from `IndexOperation`\n  - Requires named indexes (line 816-820)\n  - Has `state_forwards()`, `database_forwards()`, and `reduce()` methods\n  - Only reduces with `RemoveIndex` operations, not with `AlterIndexTogether`\n\n### 12. **FINAL** Complete Code Location Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on all 5 identified locations\n- **Target**: Exact code segments that need modification\n- **Results**:\n  - **Location 1 (639-648)**: `AlterIndexTogether` class - Simple subclass with no custom reduction logic\n  - **Location 2 (620-624)**: `can_reduce_through()` - Only allows reduction between `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n  - **Location 3 (464-470)**: `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` - Restrictive same-class-only reduction\n  - **Location 4 (864-867)**: `AddIndex.reduce()` - Only handles `RemoveIndex` operations\n  - **Location 5 (562-579)**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` base class - Normalizes tuple values\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed - **INVESTIGATION COMPLETE**\n- Mapped Django project structure\n- Located migration system components\n- Identified key files handling the `index_together` → `indexes` transition\n- Found evidence of deprecation warning handling in autodetector\n- Located the exact `AlterIndexTogether` operation class and its parent\n- Identified that `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` handles reduction logic\n- Confirmed the inheritance hierarchy: `AlterIndexTogether` → `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` → `ModelOptionOperation` → `ModelOperation` → `Operation`\n- Analyzed all relevant `reduce()` methods in the migration operations\n- Examined `AddIndex` operation implementation and its reduction capabilities\n- **FINAL**: Confirmed the exact locations where the bug manifests and reviewed all 5 code segments\n\n### 🔄 **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**\n- **STATUS**: All investigation complete, root cause identified, fix locations confirmed\n- **DECISION**: All 5 locations are ready for fixing based on comprehensive code review\n\n### ❌ **ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED** - Bug Analysis Complete\n- **CRITICAL BUG LOCATION**: The reduction logic in migration squashing doesn't handle the transition from `AlterIndexTogether` to `AddIndex` operations\n- **Specific Problem**: \n  1. `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n  2. `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n  3. `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n  4. `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648) has no custom reduction logic\n  5. **NO LOGIC EXISTS** to reduce `AlterIndexTogether` with equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- **Result**: Deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing persistent deprecation warnings\n\n## Important Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n1. **`optimizer.py`** - Core squashing logic using operation reduction\n2. **`operations/models.py`** - Model operation definitions, specifically:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` class (lines 639-648)\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` parent class (lines 562-624)\n   - `ModelOptionOperation` base class (lines 463-470)\n   - `AddIndex` class (lines 811-867)\n3. **`autodetector.py`** - Contains `generate_removed_altered_index_together()` with deprecation warnings\n4. **`state.py`** - Handles both `index_together` and `indexes` in model state\n\n### Critical Code Patterns Found\n- Operations use a `reduce()` method for optimization during squashing\n- `index_together` is marked with \"RemovedInDjango51Warning\" comments\n- Both `index_together` and `indexes` are handled in parallel in state management\n- `can_reduce_through()` method controls which operations can be reduced together during squashing\n- Reduction logic is hierarchical: `reduce()` → `can_reduce_through()` → operation-specific logic\n- `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` normalizes tuple values using `normalize_together()`\n\n### **COMPREHENSIVE FIX STRATEGY IDENTIFIED**\n\n**The bug occurs because:**\n1. `AlterIndexTogether` operations are generated when `index_together` is used (deprecated)\n2. `AddIndex` operations are generated when `indexes` is used (modern approach)\n3. During migration squashing, the optimizer tries to reduce operations using `reduce()` methods\n4. **MISSING LOGIC**: No reduction path exists between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations\n5. Therefore, deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations remain in squashed migrations, causing deprecation warnings\n\n**Precise Fix Locations Required:**\n\n1. **Primary Fix - Lines 620-624**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()`\n   - **Current**: Only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with `AddIndex` operations\n\n2. **Secondary Fix - Lines 639-648**: `AlterIndexTogether` class\n   - **Current**: Simple subclass with no custom reduction logic\n   - **Needed**: Custom `reduce()` method to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Supporting Fix - Lines 464-470**: `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` method\n   - **Current**: Only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - **Needed**: Allow `AlterIndexTogether` to bypass same-class restriction for `AddIndex` operations\n\n4. **Reverse Fix - Lines 864-867**: `AddIndex.reduce()` method\n   - **Current**: Only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **Needed**: Add logic to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` from the reverse direction\n\n5. **Base Support - Lines 562-579**: `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` base class\n   - **Current**: Normalizes tuple values, provides base functionality\n   - **Needed**: Ensure proper support for conversion logic between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n- Add logic to detect when `AlterIndexTogether` operations can be replaced by equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n- Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects during reduction\n- Ensure the conversion maintains the same database schema effect while eliminating deprecation warnings\n- Handle edge cases like partial overlaps, field renames, and complex index configurations\n- Prioritize modern `AddIndex` operations over deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations during squashing\n\n## **FINAL STATUS: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the complete root cause and exact fix locations. All 5 code segments have been reviewed and confirmed ready for implementation. The bug is a missing reduction capability in the migration squashing system that prevents proper optimization of the `index_together` → `indexes` transition. The fix strategy is comprehensive and addresses all necessary locations to eliminate deprecation warnings during migration squashing.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 639\nEnd line: 648\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 620\nEnd line: 624\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 464\nEnd line: 470\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 864\nEnd line: 867\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\nStart line: 562\nEnd line: 579\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have all the context I need to understand the complete bug and propose comprehensive repair suggestions. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**S**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations. This method should:\n   - Detect when reducing with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n   - Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects with auto-generated names\n   - Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether`\n   - Handle edge cases like empty `index_together` values\n\n3. **[Lines 464-470] ModelOptionOperation.reduce()**: Modify this base method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to bypass the same-class restriction when reducing with `AddIndex` operations. This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations. This supports the transformation needed in the `AlterIndexTogether.reduce()` method.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**: The fix should prioritize eliminating deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in favor of modern `AddIndex` operations during squashing, while maintaining identical database schema effects. The conversion logic should handle field name resolution, index naming conventions, and ensure the resulting squashed migration produces the same final database state without deprecation warnings.\nNote that the Patch provided should be a direct substitution of the location code by the Locator.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have examined all the key locations and have a complete understanding of the bug.

Let me verify each location is ready for implementation:\n\n**Location Analysis:**\n\n1. **Location 1 (AlterIndexTogether class)**: This is the main class that needs a custom `reduce()` method to handle conversion to `AddIndex` operations. Currently it's just a simple subclass - ready for enhancement.\n\n2. **Location 2 (can_reduce_through method)**: This controls which operations can be reduced together. Currently only allows reduction between `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types - needs to be extended to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to reduce with `AddIndex`.\n\n3. **Location 3 (ModelOptionOperation.reduce)**: This base method restricts reduction to same class or `DeleteModel` - needs modification to allow `AlterIndexTogether` to bypass this restriction for `AddIndex` operations.\n\n4. **Location 4 (AddIndex.reduce)**: Currently only handles `RemoveIndex` - needs to be enhanced to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` from the reverse direction.\n\n5. **Location 5 (AlterTogetherOptionOperation base)**: This provides the foundation with `normalize_together()` and option handling - the base logic is solid and ready to support the conversion.\n\n**Verification of Readiness:**\n\n✅ All locations are identified correctly\n✅ The inheritance hierarchy is clear: `AlterIndexTogether` → `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` → `ModelOptionOperation` → `ModelOperation`\n✅ The reduction chain is understood: `reduce()` → `can_reduce_through()` → operation-specific logic\n✅ The conversion requirements are clear: tuple-based `index_together` → named `Index` objects\n✅ The fix strategy addresses the core issue: missing reduction capability between `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex`\n\n**Implementation Requirements Met:**\n- All necessary imports and dependencies are available in the file\n- The `Index` class and `normalize_together` function are accessible\n- The operation hierarchy supports the needed modifications\n- The reduction pattern is well-established and can be extended\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nAll 5 locations are ready for implementation. The code segments provide the complete foundation needed to implement the cross-operation reduction logic that will eliminate deprecation warnings during migration squashing by converting deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations to modern `AddIndex` operations.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py lines 639-648\n\nImports in this file: You can

Now I have all the context I need to understand the complete bug and propose comprehensive repair suggestions. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**S**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations. This method should:\n   - Detect when reducing with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n   - Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects with auto-generated names\n   - Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether`\n   - Handle edge cases like empty `index_together` values\n\n3. **[Lines 464-470] ModelOptionOperation.reduce()**: Modify this base method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to bypass the same-class restriction when reducing with `AddIndex` operations. This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations. This supports the transformation needed in the `AlterIndexTogether.reduce()` method.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**: The fix should prioritize eliminating deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in favor of modern `AddIndex` operations during squashing, while maintaining identical database schema effects. The conversion logic should handle field name resolution, index naming conventions, and ensure the resulting squashed migration produces the same final database state without deprecation warnings.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nSquashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> indexes transition should remove deprecation warnings.\nDescription\n\t\nSquashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> Meta.indexes transition should remove deprecation warnings.

Now I have all the context I need to understand the complete bug and propose comprehensive repair suggestions. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**S**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations.

Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**S**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations. This method should:\n   - Detect when reducing with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n   - Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects with auto-generated names\n   - Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether`\n   - Handle edge cases like empty `index_together` values\n\n3. **[Lines 464-470] ModelOptionOperation.reduce()**: Modify this base method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to bypass the same-class restriction when reducing with `AddIndex` operations. This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations. This supports the transformation needed in the `AlterIndexTogether.reduce()` method.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**: The fix should prioritize eliminating deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in favor of modern `AddIndex` operations during squashing, while maintaining identical database schema effects. The conversion logic should handle field name resolution, index naming conventions, and ensure the resulting squashed migration produces the same final database state without deprecation warnings.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

Now I have all the context I need to understand the complete bug and propose comprehensive repair suggestions. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**S**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations. This method should:\n   - Detect when reducing with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n   - Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects with auto-generated names\n   - Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether`\n   - Handle edge cases like empty `index_together` values\n\n3. **[Lines 464-470] ModelOptionOperation.reduce()**: Modify this base method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to bypass the same-class restriction when reducing with `AddIndex` operations. This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations. This supports the transformation needed in the `AlterIndexTogether.reduce()` method.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**: The fix should prioritize eliminating deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in favor of modern `AddIndex` operations during squashing, while maintaining identical database schema effects. The conversion logic should handle field name resolution, index naming conventions, and ensure the resulting squashed migration produces the same final database state without deprecation warnings.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

Now I have all the context I need to understand the complete bug and propose comprehensive repair suggestions. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**S**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations. This method should:\n   - Detect when reducing with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n   - Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects with auto-generated names\n   - Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether`\n   - Handle edge cases like empty `index_together` values\n\n3. **[Lines 464-470] ModelOptionOperation.reduce()**: Modify this base method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to bypass the same-class restriction when reducing with `AddIndex` operations. This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations. This supports the transformation needed in the `AlterIndexTogether.reduce()` method.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**: The fix should prioritize eliminating deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in favor of modern `AddIndex` operations during squashing, while maintaining identical database schema effects. The conversion logic should handle field name resolution, index naming conventions, and ensure the resulting squashed migration produces the same final database state without deprecation warnings.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

Now I have all the context I need to understand the complete bug and propose comprehensive repair suggestions. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**S**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations. This method should:\n   - Detect when reducing with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n   - Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects with auto-generated names\n   - Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether`\n   - Handle edge cases like empty `index_together` values\n\n3. **[Lines 464-470] ModelOptionOperation.reduce()**: Modify this base method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to bypass the same-class restriction when reducing with `AddIndex` operations. This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations. This supports the transformation needed in the `AlterIndexTogether.reduce()` method.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**: The fix should prioritize eliminating deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in favor of modern `AddIndex` operations during squashing, while maintaining identical database schema effects.

Now I have all the context I need to understand the complete bug and propose comprehensive repair suggestions. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**S**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations. This method should:\n   - Detect when reducing with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n   - Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects with auto-generated names\n   - Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether`\n   - Handle edge cases like empty `index_together` values\n\n3. **[Lines 464-470] ModelOptionOperation.reduce()**: Modify this base method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to bypass the same-class restriction when reducing with `AddIndex` operations. This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations.

Now I have all the context I need to understand the complete bug and propose comprehensive repair suggestions. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**S**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations. This method should:\n   - Detect when reducing with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n   - Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects with auto-generated names\n   - Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether`\n   - Handle edge cases like empty `index_together` values\n\n3. **[Lines 464-470] ModelOptionOperation.reduce()**: Modify this base method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to bypass the same-class restriction when reducing with `AddIndex` operations. This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations. This supports the transformation needed in the `AlterIndexTogether.reduce()` method.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**: The fix should prioritize eliminating deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in favor of modern `AddIndex` operations during squashing, while maintaining identical database schema effects. The conversion logic should handle field name resolution, index naming conventions, and ensure the resulting squashed migration produces the same final database state without deprecation warnings.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

Now I have all the context I need to understand the complete bug and propose comprehensive repair suggestions. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**S**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations. This method should:\n   - Detect when reducing with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n   - Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects with auto-generated names\n   - Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether`\n   - Handle edge cases like empty `index_together` values\n\n3. **[Lines 464-470] ModelOptionOperation.reduce()**: Modify this base method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to bypass the same-class restriction when reducing with `AddIndex` operations. This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations. This supports the transformation needed in the `AlterIndexTogether.reduce()` method.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**: The fix should prioritize eliminating deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in favor of modern `AddIndex` operations during squashing, while maintaining identical database schema effects.

Now I have all the context I need to understand the complete bug and propose comprehensive repair suggestions. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**S**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations. This method should:\n   - Detect when reducing with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n   - Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects with auto-generated names\n   - Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether`\n   - Handle edge cases like empty `index_together` values\n\n3. **[Lines 464-470] ModelOptionOperation.reduce()**: Modify this base method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to bypass the same-class restriction when reducing with `AddIndex` operations. This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations.

Now I have all the context I need to understand the complete bug and propose comprehensive repair suggestions. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**Complete Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: When squashing migrations that contain the transition from `Meta.index_together` (deprecated) to `Meta.indexes` (modern), the squashing process doesn't eliminate deprecation warnings because `AlterIndexTogether` operations can't be reduced with equivalent `AddIndex` operations.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The reduction logic in the migration optimizer has these limitations:\n   - `AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()` (lines 620-624) only allows reduction between different `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` types\n   - `ModelOptionOperation.reduce()` (lines 464-470) only reduces with same class or `DeleteModel`\n   - `AddIndex.reduce()` (lines 864-867) only reduces with `RemoveIndex`\n   - **No logic exists** to convert `AlterIndexTogether` operations to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n\n3. **Impact**: This is a Django 4.2 release blocker because users cannot eliminate `index_together` deprecation warnings through squashing, forcing manual migration rewrites.\n\n4. **Technical Details**:\n   - `AlterIndexTogether` stores `index_together` as normalized tuples (lines 566-568)\n   - `AddIndex` works with `Index` objects that have names and field lists\n   - The conversion requires transforming tuple-based indexes to named `Index` objects\n\n**S**\n\n1. **[Lines 620-624] AlterTogetherOptionOperation.can_reduce_through()**: Enhance this method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to reduce with `AddIndex` operations. Add logic to detect when an `AlterIndexTogether` can be converted to equivalent `AddIndex` operations by checking if the operation is specifically `AlterIndexTogether` and the other operation is `AddIndex` targeting the same model.\n\n2. **[Lines 639-648] AlterIndexTogether class**: Add a custom `reduce()` method that can convert `index_together` tuples to equivalent `AddIndex` operations. This method should:\n   - Detect when reducing with `AddIndex` operations that represent the same indexes\n   - Convert `index_together` tuples to `Index` objects with auto-generated names\n   - Return the `AddIndex` operations instead of the deprecated `AlterIndexTogether`\n   - Handle edge cases like empty `index_together` values\n\n3. **[Lines 464-470] ModelOptionOperation.reduce()**: Modify this base method to allow `AlterIndexTogether` operations to bypass the same-class restriction when reducing with `AddIndex` operations. This supports the cross-operation reduction needed for the `index_together` -> `indexes` transition.\n\n4. **[Lines 864-867] AddIndex.reduce()**: Enhance this method to handle reduction with `AlterIndexTogether` operations from the reverse direction. When an `AddIndex` encounters an `AlterIndexTogether` that would create the same index, the `AddIndex` should take precedence (eliminating the deprecated operation).\n\n5. **[Lines 562-579] AlterTogetherOptionOperation base logic**: Ensure the base class properly supports the conversion logic by potentially adding helper methods to convert between tuple-based and `Index`-based representations. This supports the transformation needed in the `AlterIndexTogether.reduce()` method.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**: The fix should prioritize eliminating deprecated `AlterIndexTogether` operations in favor of modern `AddIndex` operations during squashing, while maintaining identical database schema effects. The conversion logic should handle field name resolution, index naming conventions, and ensure the resulting squashed migration produces the same final database state without deprecation warnings.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",
