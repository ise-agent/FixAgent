Looking at cleanse_setting() I realized that we ​only take care of `dict`s but don't take other types of iterables into account but ​return them as-is.\nExample:\nIn my settings.py I have this:\nMY_SETTING = {\n\t\"foo\": \"value\",\n\t\"secret\": \"value\",\n\t\"token\": \"value\",\n\t\"something\": [\n\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t],\n\t\"else\": [\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t]\n}\nOn Django 3.0 and below:\n>>> import pprint\n>>> from django.views.debug import get_safe_settings\n>>> pprint.pprint(get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\nOn Django 3.1 and up:\n>>> from django.views.debug import SafeExceptionReporterFilter\n>>> import pprint\n>>> pprint.pprint(SafeExceptionReporterFilter().get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\n",

    "response": "# Django Settings Cleaning Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's settings cleaning mechanism, specifically in the `cleanse_setting()` function within the `django.views.debug` module.\n\n## Bug Identification\n**Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py`, lines 83-100  \n**Class**: `SafeExceptionReporterFilter`  \n**Method**: `cleanse_setting()`\n\n## Current Implementation Analysis\nThe `cleanse_setting()` method currently only handles two cases:\n1. **Sensitive keys**: If a key matches the regex pattern (`API|TOKEN|KEY|SECRET|PASS|SIGNATURE`), it replaces the value with `'********************'`\n2. **Dictionary values**: If the value is a dictionary, it recursively cleanses each key-value pair\n3. **Default case**: All other values are returned as-is\n\n## Identified Bug\n**Problem**: The method only handles dictionaries but fails to properly cleanse nested iterables like lists, tuples, or other collections that might contain dictionaries with sensitive data.\n\n**Current Code (lines 91-94)**:\n```python\nelif isinstance(value, dict):\n    cleansed = {k: self.cleanse_setting(k, v) for k, v in value.items()}\nelse:\n    cleansed = value  # Bug: doesn't handle lists/tuples containing dicts\n```\n\n## Technical Context\n- **File structure**: Standard Django project layout\n- **Module path**: `django/views/debug.py` \n- **Related methods**: \n  - `get_safe_settings()` (lines 105-113) - calls `cleanse_setting()` for each setting\n  - `get_safe_request_meta()` (lines 115-121) - also uses `cleanse_setting()`\n- **Sensitive pattern**: Uses regex `'API|TOKEN|KEY|SECRET|PASS|SIGNATURE'` (case-insensitive)\n\n## Tools Used\n1. **explore_directory**: Navigated Django project structure\n2. **read_file_lines**: Examined specific code sections\n3. **search_code_with_context**: Located the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class and `cleanse_setting()` method\n\n## Current Status\n✅ **Completed**: Bug location and root cause identified  \n🔄 **Next Steps**: Implement fix to handle nested iterables (lists, tuples, etc.) containing dictionaries\n\n## Required Fix\nThe `cleanse_setting()` method needs to be enhanced to:\n1. Handle lists and tuples that may contain dictionaries\n2. Recursively process nested structures\n3. Preserve the original data structure type while cleansing sensitive content\n4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality\n\n## Key Technical Details\n- The method is used in Django's debug error reporting to sanitize sensitive settings before displaying them\n- It's part of the security mechanism to prevent accidental exposure of secrets in error pages\n- The fix must handle arbitrary nesting levels and mixed data types while maintaining performance",

Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality\n\n## Key Technical Details\n- The method is used in Django's debug error reporting to sanitize sensitive settings before displaying them\n- It's part of the security mechanism to prevent accidental exposure of secrets in error pages\n- The fix must handle arbitrary nesting levels and mixed data types while maintaining performance\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 91\nEnd line: 94\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 85\nEnd line: 87\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 88\nEnd line: 90\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 95\nEnd line: 97\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 99\nEnd line: 100\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I can see the issue clearly!

The bug is in the `cleanse_setting()` method at lines 83-100. The current implementation only handles dictionaries (line 91-92) but doesn't handle other iterables like lists, tuples, etc. that might contain dictionaries with sensitive data.\n\nLet me also check the `get_safe_settings()` method to understand the complete flow:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\", \"start_line\": 105, \"end_line\": 115 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nTotal lines: 523\nShowing lines 105-115:\n\n 105:         \"\"\"\n 106:         Return a dictionary of the settings module with values of sensitive\n 107:         settings replaced with stars (*********).\n 108:         \"\"\"\n 109:         settings_dict = {}\n 110:         for k in dir(settings):\n 111:             if k.isupper():\n 112:                 settings_dict[k] = self.cleanse_setting(k, getattr(settings, k))\n 113:         return settings_dict\n 114: \n 115:     def get_safe_request_meta(self, request):\n\nPerfect!

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Settings Cleaning Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's settings cleaning mechanism, specifically in the `cleanse_setting()` function within the `django.views.debug` module.\n\n## Bug Identification\n**Location**: `/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py`, lines 83-100  \n**Class**: `SafeExceptionReporterFilter`  \n**Method**: `cleanse_setting()`\n\n## Current Implementation Analysis\nThe `cleanse_setting()` method currently only handles two cases:\n1. **Sensitive keys**: If a key matches the regex pattern (`API|TOKEN|KEY|SECRET|PASS|SIGNATURE`), it replaces the value with `'********************'`\n2. **Dictionary values**: If the value is a dictionary, it recursively cleanses each key-value pair\n3. **Default case**: All other values are returned as-is\n\n## Identified Bug\n**Problem**: The method only handles dictionaries but fails to properly cleanse nested iterables like lists, tuples, or other collections that might contain dictionaries with sensitive data.\n\n**Current Code (lines 91-94)**:\n```python\nelif isinstance(value, dict):\n    cleansed = {k: self.cleanse_setting(k, v) for k, v in value.items()}\nelse:\n    cleansed = value  # Bug: doesn't handle lists/tuples containing dicts\n```\n\n## Technical Context\n- **File structure**: Standard Django project layout\n- **Module path**: `django/views/debug.py` \n- **Related methods**: \n  - `get_safe_settings()` (lines 105-113) - calls `cleanse_setting()` for each setting\n  - `get_safe_request_meta()` (lines 115-121) - also uses `cleanse_setting()`\n- **Sensitive pattern**: Uses regex `'API|TOKEN|KEY|SECRET|PASS|SIGNATURE'` (case-insensitive)\n\n## Tools Used\n1. **explore_directory**: Navigated Django project structure\n2. **read_file_lines**: Examined specific code sections\n3. **search_code_with_context**: Located the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class and `cleanse_setting()` method\n\n## Current Status\n✅ **Completed**: Bug location and root cause identified  \n🔄 **Next Steps**: Implement fix to handle nested iterables (lists, tuples, etc.) containing dictionaries\n\n## Required Fix\nThe `cleanse_setting()` method needs to be enhanced to:\n1. Handle lists and tuples that may contain dictionaries\n2. Recursively process nested structures\n3. Preserve the original data structure type while cleansing sensitive content\n4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality\n\n## Key Technical Details\n- The method is used in Django's debug error reporting to sanitize sensitive settings before displaying them\n- It's part of the security mechanism to prevent accidental exposure of secrets in error pages\n- The fix must handle arbitrary nesting levels and mixed data types while maintaining performance\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 91\nEnd line: 94\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 85\nEnd line: 87\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 88\nEnd line: 90\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 95\nEnd line: 97\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 99\nEnd line: 100\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django settings cleaning bug, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for each identified location:\n\n1. **Lines 91-94 (Primary Bug Location)**: Replace the simple `isinstance(value, dict)` check with comprehensive iterable handling that recursively processes lists, tuples, and other sequences while preserving their original types.

Let me read the complete `cleanse_setting()` method to understand the current implementation:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\", \"start_line\": 83, \"end_line\": 100 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nTotal lines: 523\nShowing lines 83-100:\n\n  83:     def cleanse_setting(self, key, value):\n  84:         \"\"\"\n  85:         Cleanse an individual setting key/value of sensitive content.

The bug is in the `cleanse_setting()` method at lines 83-100. The current implementation only handles dictionaries (line 91-92) but doesn't handle other iterables like lists, tuples, etc. that might contain dictionaries with sensitive data.\n\nLet me also check the `get_safe_settings()` method to understand the complete flow:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\", \"start_line\": 105, \"end_line\": 115 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nTotal lines: 523\nShowing lines 105-115:\n\n 105:         \"\"\"\n 106:         Return a dictionary of the settings module with values of sensitive\n 107:         settings replaced with stars (*********).\n 108:         \"\"\"\n 109:         settings_dict = {}\n 110:         for k in dir(settings):\n 111:             if k.isupper():\n 112:                 settings_dict[k] = self.cleanse_setting(k, getattr(settings, k))\n 113:         return settings_dict\n 114: \n 115:     def get_safe_request_meta(self, request):\n\nPerfect!

The fix should add an `elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):` branch that applies `cleanse_setting()` to each element and reconstructs the original container type.\n\n2. **Lines 85-87 (Documentation)**: Update the docstring to accurately reflect the enhanced functionality: change \"If the value is a dictionary, recursively cleanse the keys in that dictionary\" to \"If the value is a dictionary or other iterable, recursively cleanse nested structures that may contain sensitive data.\"\n\n3. **Lines 88-90 (Sensitive Key Detection)**: This logic works correctly and should remain unchanged - it properly identifies sensitive keys using the regex pattern. The recursive application of this logic to nested structures will be handled by the enhanced conditional logic in location 1.\n\n4. **Lines 95-97 (Exception Handling)**: The TypeError exception handling should be preserved as-is since it covers cases where keys aren't regex-compatible. The new iterable processing logic should be wrapped within the existing try-except block to maintain the same error resilience.\n\n5. **Lines 99-100 (Return Processing)**: The callable wrapper logic should remain unchanged and continue to be applied after all cleansing operations. This ensures that callable settings are properly wrapped regardless of whether they were processed through the new iterable handling or existing dictionary logic.\n\nThe key insight is that locations 1 is the core fix that enables recursive processing of nested iterables, while locations 2-5 provide the supporting context that must be preserved to maintain framework integrity and backward compatibility.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py lines 91-94\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            elif isinstance(value, dict):\n                cleansed = {k: self.cleanse_setting(k, v) for k, v in value.items()}\n            else:\n                cleansed = value\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py lines 85-87\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Cleanse an individual setting key/value of sensitive content.

Handle lists and tuples that may contain dictionaries\n2. Recursively process nested structures\n3. Preserve the original data structure type while cleansing sensitive content\n4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality\n\n## Key Technical Details\n- The method is used in Django's debug error reporting to sanitize sensitive settings before displaying them\n- It's part of the security mechanism to prevent accidental exposure of secrets in error pages\n- The fix must handle arbitrary nesting levels and mixed data types while maintaining performance\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 91\nEnd line: 94\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 85\nEnd line: 87\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 88\nEnd line: 90\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 95\nEnd line: 97\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nStart line: 99\nEnd line: 100\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django settings cleaning bug, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for each identified location:\n\n1. **Lines 91-94 (Primary Bug Location)**: Replace the simple `isinstance(value, dict)` check with comprehensive iterable handling that recursively processes lists, tuples, and other sequences while preserving their original types.

The bug is in the `cleanse_setting()` method at lines 83-100. The current implementation only handles dictionaries (line 91-92) but doesn't handle other iterables like lists, tuples, etc. that might contain dictionaries with sensitive data.\n\nLet me also check the `get_safe_settings()` method to understand the complete flow:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\", \"start_line\": 105, \"end_line\": 115 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py\nTotal lines: 523\nShowing lines 105-115:\n\n 105:         \"\"\"\n 106:         Return a dictionary of the settings module with values of sensitive\n 107:         settings replaced with stars (*********).\n 108:         \"\"\"\n 109:         settings_dict = {}\n 110:         for k in dir(settings):\n 111:             if k.isupper():\n 112:                 settings_dict[k] = self.cleanse_setting(k, getattr(settings, k))\n 113:         return settings_dict\n 114: \n 115:     def get_safe_request_meta(self, request):\n\nPerfect!

The fix should add an `elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):` branch that applies `cleanse_setting()` to each element and reconstructs the original container type.\n\n2. **Lines 85-87 (Documentation)**: Update the docstring to accurately reflect the enhanced functionality: change \"If the value is a dictionary, recursively cleanse the keys in that dictionary\" to \"If the value is a dictionary or other iterable, recursively cleanse nested structures that may contain sensitive data.\"\n\n3. **Lines 88-90 (Sensitive Key Detection)**: This logic works correctly and should remain unchanged - it properly identifies sensitive keys using the regex pattern. The recursive application of this logic to nested structures will be handled by the enhanced conditional logic in location 1.\n\n4. **Lines 95-97 (Exception Handling)**: The TypeError exception handling should be preserved as-is since it covers cases where keys aren't regex-compatible. The new iterable processing logic should be wrapped within the existing try-except block to maintain the same error resilience.\n\n5. **Lines 99-100 (Return Processing)**: The callable wrapper logic should remain unchanged and continue to be applied after all cleansing operations. This ensures that callable settings are properly wrapped regardless of whether they were processed through the new iterable handling or existing dictionary logic.\n\nThe key insight is that locations 1 is the core fix that enables recursive processing of nested iterables, while locations 2-5 provide the supporting context that must be preserved to maintain framework integrity and backward compatibility.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py lines 91-94\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            elif isinstance(value, dict):\n                cleansed = {k: self.cleanse_setting(k, v) for k, v in value.items()}\n            else:\n                cleansed = value\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_1/django/django/views/debug.py lines 85-87\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Cleanse an individual setting key/value of sensitive content.
