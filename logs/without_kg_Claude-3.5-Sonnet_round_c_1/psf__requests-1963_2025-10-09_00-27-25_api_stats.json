    "response": "Based on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I have identified the bug and its location.

POST → 303 See Other (correctly converts POST to GET)\n2. GET → 307 Temporary Redirect (should preserve GET, but incorrectly reverts to original POST)\n\n**The Fix**: The method should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req`. However, for the first iteration, we still need to copy the original request.\n\n## Bug Location\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/requests/requests/sessions.py`\n**Lines**: 88-91\n\nThe fix requires modifying the logic to:\n1. Initialize `prepared_request` from the original request only on the first iteration\n2. For subsequent iterations, copy the current `prepared_request` to preserve modifications from previous redirects\n\n**Specific line ranges that need modification:**\n- **Lines 88-91**: Initialize loop variable and handle first vs subsequent request copying\n- **Lines 183-184**: End of loop where we need to update the request reference for next iteration\n\nThe bug manifests in the redirect handling loop where each iteration incorrectly resets to the original request instead of building upon the modifications made in previous redirect steps.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**",

For subsequent iterations, copy the current `prepared_request` to preserve modifications from previous redirects\n\n**Specific line ranges that need modification:**\n- **Lines 88-91**: Initialize loop variable and handle first vs subsequent request copying\n- **Lines 183-184**: End of loop where we need to update the request reference for next iteration\n\nThe bug manifests in the redirect handling loop where each iteration incorrectly resets to the original request instead of building upon the modifications made in previous redirect steps.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\n`Session.resolve_redirects` copies the original request for all subsequent requests, can cause incorrect method selection\nConsider the following redirection chain:\n\n```\nPOST /do_something HTTP/1.1\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 303 See Other\nLocation: /new_thing_1513\n\nGET /new_thing_1513\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect\nLocation: //failover.example.com/new_thing_1513\n```\n\nThe intermediate 303 See Other has caused the POST to be converted to\na GET.  The subsequent 307 should preserve the GET.  However, because\n`Session.resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the _original_\nrequest object, Requests will issue a POST!\n\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list.

This causes the method to lose modifications made during previous redirects in a chain.\n\n**The Problem:**\nIn a redirect chain like POST → 303 → 307:\n1. First redirect (303 See Other): POST correctly converts to GET\n2. Second redirect (307 Temporary Redirect): Should preserve GET, but incorrectly reverts to original POST because it copies `req` (original request) instead of the modified request from step 1\n\n**The Fix Location:**\nLines 88-91 contain the loop initialization and request copying logic that needs to be modified to:\n- Copy the original request (`req`) only on the first iteration\n- Copy the current `prepared_request` on subsequent iterations to preserve method conversions from previous redirects\n\nThis single location fix will resolve the incorrect method selection issue in redirect chains.",

Here's what I found:\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**Root Cause**: In the `Session.resolve_redirects` method, line 91 always copies the original request (`req`) instead of the current request from the previous iteration:\n\n```python\nprepared_request = req.copy()  # BUG: Always copies original request\n```\n\n**Problem**: This causes incorrect method selection in redirect chains where:\n1. POST → 303 See Other (correctly converts POST to GET)\n2. GET → 307 Temporary Redirect (should preserve GET, but incorrectly reverts to original POST)\n\n**The Fix**: The method should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req`. However, for the first iteration, we still need to copy the original request.\n\n## Bug Location\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/requests/requests/sessions.py`\n**Lines**: 88-91\n\nThe fix requires modifying the logic to:\n1. Initialize `prepared_request` from the original request only on the first iteration\n2. For subsequent iterations, copy the current `prepared_request` to preserve modifications from previous redirects\n\n**Specific line ranges that need modification:**\n- **Lines 88-91**: Initialize loop variable and handle first vs subsequent request copying\n- **Lines 183-184**: End of loop where we need to update the request reference for next iteration\n\nThe bug manifests in the redirect handling loop where each iteration incorrectly resets to the original request instead of building upon the modifications made in previous redirect steps.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug in `Session.resolve_redirects`, I have identified the specific locations where the issue occurs and needs to be fixed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 88,\n            \"end_line\": 91\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is located at line 91 in the `resolve_redirects` method where `prepared_request = req.copy()` always copies the original request (`req`) instead of the current request from the previous iteration. This causes the method to lose modifications made during previous redirects in a chain.\n\n**The Problem:**\nIn a redirect chain like POST → 303 → 307:\n1. First redirect (303 See Other): POST correctly converts to GET\n2. Second redirect (307 Temporary Redirect): Should preserve GET, but incorrectly reverts to original POST because it copies `req` (original request) instead of the modified request from step 1\n\n**The Fix Location:**\nLines 88-91 contain the loop initialization and request copying logic that needs to be modified to:\n- Copy the original request (`req`) only on the first iteration\n- Copy the current `prepared_request` on subsequent iterations to preserve method conversions from previous redirects\n\nThis single location fix will resolve the incorrect method selection issue in redirect chains.\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem is exactly as I analyzed:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: Line 91 in `resolve_redirects` method: `prepared_request = req.copy()`\n2. **Root Cause**: Always copying the original request instead of the current/modified request\n3. **Impact**: In redirect chains, method conversions from previous redirects are lost\n4. **Example**: POST → 303 (converts to GET) → 307 (should preserve GET, but reverts to POST)\n\nThe fix needs to ensure that after the first iteration, we copy the current `prepared_request` (which has the converted method) rather than the original `req`.\n\nLet me examine the exact code structure around lines 88-91 to understand the loop context better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 85, \"end_line\": 95 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 571\nShowing lines 85-95:\n\n  85:                           verify=True, cert=None, proxies=None):\n  86:         \"\"\"Receives a Response.

Looking at the `resolve_redirects` method, I can see the issue clearly:\n\n1. **The Bug**: On line 91, `prepared_request = req.copy()` always copies the original request (`req`) instead of the current/modified request from the previous iteration.\n\n2. **The Problem**: In a redirect chain where:\n   - POST → 303 See Other (converts to GET)\n   - GET → 307 Temporary Redirect (should preserve GET)\n   \n   The method incorrectly copies the original POST request for the second redirect instead of the modified GET request from the first redirect.\n\n3. **The Fix**: The method should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req`.\n\n4. **Location**: The bug is specifically at line 91 in `/root/hy/projects_1/requests/requests/sessions.py`\n\nLet me also check if there are any imports needed for the fix.\n\n#TOOL_CALL show_file_imports { \"python_file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/requests/requests/sessions.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\n['import os\\n', 'from collections import Mapping\\n', 'from datetime import datetime\\n', '\\nfrom .compat import cookielib, OrderedDict, urljoin, urlparse, builtin_str\\n', 'from .cookies import (\\n', 'from .models import Request, PreparedRequest, DEFAULT_REDIRECT_LIMIT\\n', 'from .hooks import default_hooks, dispatch_hook\\n', 'from .utils import to_key_val_list, default_headers, to_native_string\\n', 'from .exceptions import TooManyRedirects, InvalidSchema\\n', 'from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\\n', '\\nfrom .adapters import HTTPAdapter\\n', '\\nfrom .utils import requote_uri, get_environ_proxies, get_netrc_auth\\n', '\\nfrom .status_codes import codes\\n', 'from .models import REDIRECT_STATI\\n']\nBased on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I have identified the bug and its location. Here's what I found:\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**Root Cause**: In the `Session.resolve_redirects` method, line 91 always copies the original request (`req`) instead of the current request from the previous iteration:\n\n```python\nprepared_request = req.copy()  # BUG: Always copies original request\n```\n\n**Problem**: This causes incorrect method selection in redirect chains where:\n1. POST → 303 See Other (correctly converts POST to GET)\n2. GET → 307 Temporary Redirect (should preserve GET, but incorrectly reverts to original POST)\n\n**The Fix**: The method should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req`. However, for the first iteration, we still need to copy the original request.\n\n## Bug Location\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_1/requests/requests/sessions.py`\n**Lines**: 88-91\n\nThe fix requires modifying the logic to:\n1. Initialize `prepared_request` from the original request only on the first iteration\n2. For subsequent iterations, copy the current `prepared_request` to preserve modifications from previous redirects\n\n**Specific line ranges that need modification:**\n- **Lines 88-91**: Initialize loop variable and handle first vs subsequent request copying\n- **Lines 183-184**: End of loop where we need to update the request reference for next iteration\n\nThe bug manifests in the redirect handling loop where each iteration incorrectly resets to the original request instead of building upon the modifications made in previous redirect steps.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug in `Session.resolve_redirects`, I have identified the specific locations where the issue occurs and needs to be fixed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 88,\n            \"end_line\": 91\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is located at line 91 in the `resolve_redirects` method where `prepared_request = req.copy()` always copies the original request (`req`) instead of the current request from the previous iteration. This causes the method to lose modifications made during previous redirects in a chain.\n\n**The Problem:**\nIn a redirect chain like POST → 303 → 307:\n1. First redirect (303 See Other): POST correctly converts to GET\n2. Second redirect (307 Temporary Redirect): Should preserve GET, but incorrectly reverts to original POST because it copies `req` (original request) instead of the modified request from step 1\n\n**The Fix Location:**\nLines 88-91 contain the loop initialization and request copying logic that needs to be modified to:\n- Copy the original request (`req`) only on the first iteration\n- Copy the current `prepared_request` on subsequent iterations to preserve method conversions from previous redirects\n\nThis single location fix will resolve the incorrect method selection issue in redirect chains.\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem is exactly as I analyzed:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: Line 91 in `resolve_redirects` method: `prepared_request = req.copy()`\n2. **Root Cause**: Always copying the original request instead of the current/modified request\n3. **Impact**: In redirect chains, method conversions from previous redirects are lost\n4. **Example**: POST → 303 (converts to GET) → 307 (should preserve GET, but reverts to POST)\n\nThe fix needs to ensure that after the first iteration, we copy the current `prepared_request` (which has the converted method) rather than the original `req`.\n\nLet me examine the exact code structure around lines 88-91 to understand the loop context better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_1/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 85, \"end_line\": 95 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_1/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 571\nShowing lines 85-95:\n\n  85:                           verify=True, cert=None, proxies=None):\n  86:         \"\"\"Receives a Response.

The issue is in the `resolve_redirects` method where line 91 `prepared_request = req.copy()` always copies the original request instead of preserving modifications from previous redirects.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n- In a redirect chain like POST → 303 → 307:\n  1. First redirect (303 See Other): POST correctly converts to GET\n  2. Second redirect (307 Temporary Redirect): Should preserve GET, but incorrectly reverts to original POST because it copies `req` (original request) instead of the modified request\n\n**The Fix Strategy:**\nI need to modify the logic so that:\n- **First iteration** (`i == 0`): Copy the original request (`req`)\n- **Subsequent iterations** (`i > 0`): Copy the current `prepared_request` to preserve method conversions\n\nLooking at the context, I need to maintain proper indentation (8 spaces for the code inside the method).
