Most notably, ​`reverse`. Like the other call-sites, reverse calls get_resolver with the result of get_urlconf.\nIf reverse (or anything else using get_resolver) is called both before (e.g. at import time) and after a request is handled, get_resolver will be called with different values. Initially it will be called with None, and later if will be called with settings.ROOT_URLCONF, because request handling calls set_urlconf.\nIn an application with a large number of routes, URLResolver._populate can be expensive, so calling it twice and storing those caches twice is wasteful.\nMy proposed solution is just to modify ​`get_resolver` to look up settings.ROOT_URLCONF before the memoized function call.\nI'm planning to contribute a fix, as soon as I can get the CLA signed.\n",

What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nOptimization: Multiple URLResolvers may be unintentionally be constructed by calls to `django.urls.resolvers.get_resolver`\nDescription\n\t\nMultiple URLResolvers may be constructed by django.urls.resolvers.get_resolver if django.urls.base.set_urlconf has not yet been called, resulting in multiple expensive calls to URLResolver._populate.\n​`get_resolver` constructs a new URLResolver, and caches it using functools.lru_cache.\nURLResolver instances can pre-compute a large amount of information about routes in ​`URLResolver._populate`, and they store those caches as instance variables.\n​`set_urlconf` is called with when ​we first handle a request in `BaseHandler.get_response`.\nget_resolver has a number of call-sites. Most notably, ​`reverse`. Like the other call-sites, reverse calls get_resolver with the result of get_urlconf.\nIf reverse (or anything else using get_resolver) is called both before (e.g. at import time) and after a request is handled, get_resolver will be called with different values. Initially it will be called with None, and later if will be called with settings.ROOT_URLCONF, because request handling calls set_urlconf.\nIn an application with a large number of routes, URLResolver._populate can be expensive, so calling it twice and storing those caches twice is wasteful.\nMy proposed solution is just to modify ​`get_resolver` to look up settings.ROOT_URLCONF before the memoized function call.\nI'm planning to contribute a fix, as soon as I can get the CLA signed.\n",

Current Implementation Analysis\n\n#### `get_resolver` Function (resolvers.py, lines 67-70):\n```python\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n```\n\n#### Thread-Local URL Configuration System (base.py):\n- **`_urlconfs`**: Thread-local storage for overridden URLconfs (line 19)\n- **`set_urlconf(urlconf_name)`**: Sets thread-specific URLconf (lines 127-136)\n- **`get_urlconf(default=None)`**: Retrieves thread-specific URLconf (lines 139-144)\n\n#### Integration Points:\n- `resolve()` function (base.py, lines 22-25) calls `get_urlconf()` then `get_resolver(urlconf)`\n- `reverse()` function (base.py, lines 28-31) follows same pattern\n\n## Identified Problem Pattern\nThe current `get_resolver` function creates a new URLResolver instance every time it's called, which suggests:\n\n1. **No Caching**: Each call to `get_resolver` creates a new URLResolver instance\n2. **Thread-Local Disconnect**: The function doesn't properly integrate with the thread-local URLconf system (`_urlconfs`)\n3. **Performance Issue**: Repeated URLResolver instantiation for the same URLconf\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Project structure analysis\n- ✅ **Completed**: Core function identification and analysis\n- ✅ **Completed**: Thread-local system understanding\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Bug pattern identification\n- ❌ **Pending**: Detailed URLResolver class analysis\n- ❌ **Pending**: Caching mechanism implementation\n- ❌ **Pending**: Bug fix and testing\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine URLResolver Class**: Analyze the full URLResolver implementation to understand its caching capabilities\n2. **Identify Caching Strategy**: Determine how to implement proper caching that respects thread-local URLconf changes\n3. **Implement Fix**: Modify `get_resolver` to cache URLResolver instances while properly handling thread-local overrides\n4. **Test Integration**: Ensure the fix works with `set_urlconf`/`get_urlconf` thread-local system\n\n## Technical Considerations\n- **Thread Safety**: Any caching solution must respect thread-local URLconf overrides\n- **Memory Management**: Cached resolvers should be properly cleaned up\n- **Performance**: The fix should improve performance without breaking existing functionality\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Changes should not affect the public API\n\nThe bug appears to be a missing optimization where URLResolver instances should be cached and reused, but the current implementation creates new instances on every call, potentially causing performance issues in high-traffic scenarios.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine the `get_urlconf` function to understand how it works with `set_urlconf`.\n\n#TOOL_CALL find_methods_by_name { \"name\": \"get_urlconf\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\n[{'absolute_path': '/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/base.py', 'full_qualified_name': 'django.urls.base.get_urlconf', 'content': ' 139: def get_urlconf(default=None):\\n 140:     \"\"\"\\n 141:     Return the root URLconf to use for the current thread if it has been\\n 142:     changed from the default one.\\n 143:     \"\"\"\\n 144:     return getattr(_urlconfs, \"value\", default)', 'start_line': 139, 'end_line': 144, 'analysis_header': '=== RELATIONSHIPS ANALYSIS ===', 'relationships': {'BELONGS_TO': [], 'CALLS': [], 'HAS_METHOD': [], 'HAS_VARIABLE': [], 'INHERITS': [], 'REFERENCES': []}}]\nNow let me examine the `_urlconfs` variable and understand how the thread-local storage works in the base.py file.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/base.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/base.py\nTotal lines: 180\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from urllib.parse import urlsplit, urlunsplit\n   2: \n   3: from asgiref.local import Local\n   4: \n   5: from django.utils.encoding import iri_to_uri\n   6: from django.utils.functional import lazy\n   7: from django.utils.translation import override\n   8: \n   9: from .exceptions import NoReverseMatch, Resolver404\n  10: from .resolvers import get_ns_resolver, get_resolver\n  11: from .utils import get_callable\n  12: \n  13: # SCRIPT_NAME prefixes for each thread are stored here.

Current Implementation Analysis\n\n#### `get_resolver` Function (resolvers.py, lines 67-70):\n```python\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n```\n\n#### Thread-Local URL Configuration System (base.py):\n- **`_urlconfs`**: Thread-local storage for overridden URLconfs (line 19)\n- **`set_urlconf(urlconf_name)`**: Sets thread-specific URLconf (lines 127-136)\n- **`get_urlconf(default=None)`**: Retrieves thread-specific URLconf (lines 139-144)\n\n#### Integration Points:\n- `resolve()` function (base.py, lines 22-25) calls `get_urlconf()` then `get_resolver(urlconf)`\n- `reverse()` function (base.py, lines 28-31) follows same pattern\n\n## Identified Problem Pattern\nThe current `get_resolver` function creates a new URLResolver instance every time it's called, which suggests:\n\n1. **No Caching**: Each call to `get_resolver` creates a new URLResolver instance\n2. **Thread-Local Disconnect**: The function doesn't properly integrate with the thread-local URLconf system (`_urlconfs`)\n3. **Performance Issue**: Repeated URLResolver instantiation for the same URLconf\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Project structure analysis\n- ✅ **Completed**: Core function identification and analysis\n- ✅ **Completed**: Thread-local system understanding\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Bug pattern identification\n- ❌ **Pending**: Detailed URLResolver class analysis\n- ❌ **Pending**: Caching mechanism implementation\n- ❌ **Pending**: Bug fix and testing\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine URLResolver Class**: Analyze the full URLResolver implementation to understand its caching capabilities\n2. **Identify Caching Strategy**: Determine how to implement proper caching that respects thread-local URLconf changes\n3. **Implement Fix**: Modify `get_resolver` to cache URLResolver instances while properly handling thread-local overrides\n4. **Test Integration**: Ensure the fix works with `set_urlconf`/`get_urlconf` thread-local system\n\n## Technical Considerations\n- **Thread Safety**: Any caching solution must respect thread-local URLconf overrides\n- **Memory Management**: Cached resolvers should be properly cleaned up\n- **Performance**: The fix should improve performance without breaking existing functionality\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Changes should not affect the public API\n\nThe bug appears to be a missing optimization where URLResolver instances should be cached and reused, but the current implementation creates new instances on every call, potentially causing performance issues in high-traffic scenarios.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine the `get_urlconf` function to understand how it works with `set_urlconf`.\n\n#TOOL_CALL find_methods_by_name { \"name\": \"get_urlconf\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\n[{'absolute_path': '/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/base.py', 'full_qualified_name': 'django.urls.base.get_urlconf', 'content': ' 139: def get_urlconf(default=None):\\n 140:     \"\"\"\\n 141:     Return the root URLconf to use for the current thread if it has been\\n 142:     changed from the default one.\\n 143:     \"\"\"\\n 144:     return getattr(_urlconfs, \"value\", default)', 'start_line': 139, 'end_line': 144, 'analysis_header': '=== RELATIONSHIPS ANALYSIS ===', 'relationships': {'BELONGS_TO': [], 'CALLS': [], 'HAS_METHOD': [], 'HAS_VARIABLE': [], 'INHERITS': [], 'REFERENCES': []}}]\nNow let me examine the `_urlconfs` variable and understand how the thread-local storage works in the base.py file.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/base.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/base.py\nTotal lines: 180\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from urllib.parse import urlsplit, urlunsplit\n   2: \n   3: from asgiref.local import Local\n   4: \n   5: from django.utils.encoding import iri_to_uri\n   6: from django.utils.functional import lazy\n   7: from django.utils.translation import override\n   8: \n   9: from .exceptions import NoReverseMatch, Resolver404\n  10: from .resolvers import get_ns_resolver, get_resolver\n  11: from .utils import get_callable\n  12: \n  13: # SCRIPT_NAME prefixes for each thread are stored here.

Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\n**The Bug Pattern:**\n1. `get_resolver(urlconf=None)` is called before any request handling (e.g., at import time)\n2. Since `urlconf=None`, it uses `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` \n3. Later, after `set_urlconf()` is called during request handling, `get_resolver()` is called again\n4. The first call gets cached with `None` as the key, the second with `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` as the key\n5. This results in two different URLResolver instances being created and cached, both doing expensive `_populate()` operations\n\n**The Root Cause:**\nThe current `get_resolver` function (lines 67-70 in resolvers.py) takes `urlconf` as a parameter and only resolves `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` inside the function. Since `functools.lru_cache` caches based on the input parameters, `get_resolver(None)` and `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` are treated as different cache entries.\n\n**The Solution:**\nThe proposed fix is to resolve `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` BEFORE the memoized function call, so that both scenarios result in the same cache key.\n\nLet me examine the current `get_resolver` implementation to see if it's using `functools.lru_cache` and understand the exact caching mechanism.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"lru_cache\", \"search_dir\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'lru_cache' (showing first 5 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/converters.py\nLines 1-5:\n   1: import uuid\n   2: from functools import lru_cache\n   3: \n   4: \n   5: class IntConverter:\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/converters.py\nLines 57-63:\n  57:     get_converters.cache_clear()\n  58: \n  59: \n  60: @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  61: def get_converters():\n  62:     return {**DEFAULT_CONVERTERS, **REGISTERED_CONVERTERS}\n  63: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/utils.py\nLines 5-11:\n   5: from django.utils.module_loading import module_has_submodule\n   6: \n   7: \n   8: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n   9: def get_callable(lookup_view):\n  10:     \"\"\"\n  11:     Return a callable corresponding to lookup_view.\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nLines 63-69:\n  63:         )\n  64: \n  65: \n  66: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  67: def get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n  68:     if urlconf is None:\n  69:         urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nLines 70-76:\n  70:     return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n  71: \n  72: \n  73: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  74: def get_ns_resolver(ns_pattern, resolver, converters):\n  75:     # Build a namespaced resolver for the given parent URLconf pattern.\n  76:     # This makes it possible to have captured parameters in the parent\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect!

What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nOptimization: Multiple URLResolvers may be unintentionally be constructed by calls to `django.urls.resolvers.get_resolver`\nDescription\n\t\nMultiple URLResolvers may be constructed by django.urls.resolvers.get_resolver if django.urls.base.set_urlconf has not yet been called, resulting in multiple expensive calls to URLResolver._populate.\n​`get_resolver` constructs a new URLResolver, and caches it using functools.lru_cache.\nURLResolver instances can pre-compute a large amount of information about routes in ​`URLResolver._populate`, and they store those caches as instance variables.\n​`set_urlconf` is called with when ​we first handle a request in `BaseHandler.get_response`.\nget_resolver has a number of call-sites. Most notably, ​`reverse`. Like the other call-sites, reverse calls get_resolver with the result of get_urlconf.\nIf reverse (or anything else using get_resolver) is called both before (e.g. at import time) and after a request is handled, get_resolver will be called with different values. Initially it will be called with None, and later if will be called with settings.ROOT_URLCONF, because request handling calls set_urlconf.\nIn an application with a large number of routes, URLResolver._populate can be expensive, so calling it twice and storing those caches twice is wasteful.\nMy proposed solution is just to modify ​`get_resolver` to look up settings.ROOT_URLCONF before the memoized function call.\nI'm planning to contribute a fix, as soon as I can get the CLA signed.\n",

Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**The Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Current Implementation**: `get_resolver` is decorated with `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)` and takes `urlconf=None` as parameter\n2. **Cache Key Problem**: The cache key is based on the input parameter `urlconf`\n3. **Two Different Cache Entries**:\n   - When called early (import time): `get_resolver(None)` → cached with key `None`\n   - When called after request handling: `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` → cached with key `settings.ROOT_URLCONF`\n4. **Result**: Two separate URLResolver instances are created and cached, both calling expensive `URLResolver._populate()`\n\n**The Root Cause**: The `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution happens INSIDE the cached function, so the cache sees different input parameters as different cache entries.\n\n**The Fix**: Resolve `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` BEFORE the cached function call, so both scenarios use the same cache key.\n\nNow I need to identify the exact line ranges where the fix should be applied.

When `get_resolver(None)` is called (e.g., at import time) versus `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` (after request handling), these are treated as different cache entries, causing two separate URLResolver instances to be created and cached.\n\n**Impact**: This results in multiple expensive `URLResolver._populate()` calls, which is wasteful for applications with large numbers of routes.\n\n**Required Fix**: The `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution needs to happen BEFORE the cached function call, ensuring both scenarios use the same cache key and share the same URLResolver instance.",

Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**The Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Current Implementation**: `get_resolver` is decorated with `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)` and takes `urlconf=None` as parameter\n2. **Cache Key Problem**: The cache key is based on the input parameter `urlconf`\n3. **Two Different Cache Entries**:\n   - When called early (import time): `get_resolver(None)` → cached with key `None`\n   - When called after request handling: `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` → cached with key `settings.ROOT_URLCONF`\n4. **Result**: Two separate URLResolver instances are created and cached, both calling expensive `URLResolver._populate()`\n\n**The Root Cause**: The `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution happens INSIDE the cached function, so the cache sees different input parameters as different cache entries.\n\n**The Fix**: Resolve `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` BEFORE the cached function call, so both scenarios use the same cache key.\n\nNow I need to identify the exact line ranges where the fix should be applied. Based on my analysis, the bug is in lines 66-70 of `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py`.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Location Analysis\n\nI have identified the precise location of the Django URLResolver optimization bug:\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py`\n**Lines**: 66-70\n\n**Current Problematic Code**:\n```python\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n```\n\n**Root Cause**: The `functools.lru_cache` decorator caches based on input parameters. When `get_resolver(None)` is called (e.g., at import time) versus `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` (after request handling), these are treated as different cache entries, causing two separate URLResolver instances to be created and cached.\n\n**Impact**: This results in multiple expensive `URLResolver._populate()` calls, which is wasteful for applications with large numbers of routes.\n\n**Required Fix**: The `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution needs to happen BEFORE the cached function call, ensuring both scenarios use the same cache key and share the same URLResolver instance.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nOptimization: Multiple URLResolvers may be unintentionally be constructed by calls to `django.urls.resolvers.get_resolver`\nDescription\n\t\nMultiple URLResolvers may be constructed by django.urls.resolvers.get_resolver if django.urls.base.set_urlconf has not yet been called, resulting in multiple expensive calls to URLResolver._populate.\n​`get_resolver` constructs a new URLResolver, and caches it using functools.lru_cache.\nURLResolver instances can pre-compute a large amount of information about routes in ​`URLResolver._populate`, and they store those caches as instance variables.\n​`set_urlconf` is called with when ​we first handle a request in `BaseHandler.get_response`.\nget_resolver has a number of call-sites.

Like the other call-sites, reverse calls get_resolver with the result of get_urlconf.\nIf reverse (or anything else using get_resolver) is called both before (e.g. at import time) and after a request is handled, get_resolver will be called with different values. Initially it will be called with None, and later if will be called with settings.ROOT_URLCONF, because request handling calls set_urlconf.\nIn an application with a large number of routes, URLResolver._populate can be expensive, so calling it twice and storing those caches twice is wasteful.\nMy proposed solution is just to modify ​`get_resolver` to look up settings.ROOT_URLCONF before the memoized function call.\nI'm planning to contribute a fix, as soon as I can get the CLA signed.\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list.

Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\n**The Bug Pattern:**\n1. `get_resolver(urlconf=None)` is called before any request handling (e.g., at import time)\n2. Since `urlconf=None`, it uses `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` \n3. Later, after `set_urlconf()` is called during request handling, `get_resolver()` is called again\n4. The first call gets cached with `None` as the key, the second with `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` as the key\n5. This results in two different URLResolver instances being created and cached, both doing expensive `_populate()` operations\n\n**The Root Cause:**\nThe current `get_resolver` function (lines 67-70 in resolvers.py) takes `urlconf` as a parameter and only resolves `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` inside the function. Since `functools.lru_cache` caches based on the input parameters, `get_resolver(None)` and `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` are treated as different cache entries.\n\n**The Solution:**\nThe proposed fix is to resolve `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` BEFORE the memoized function call, so that both scenarios result in the same cache key.\n\nLet me examine the current `get_resolver` implementation to see if it's using `functools.lru_cache` and understand the exact caching mechanism.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"lru_cache\", \"search_dir\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'lru_cache' (showing first 5 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/converters.py\nLines 1-5:\n   1: import uuid\n   2: from functools import lru_cache\n   3: \n   4: \n   5: class IntConverter:\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/converters.py\nLines 57-63:\n  57:     get_converters.cache_clear()\n  58: \n  59: \n  60: @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  61: def get_converters():\n  62:     return {**DEFAULT_CONVERTERS, **REGISTERED_CONVERTERS}\n  63: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/utils.py\nLines 5-11:\n   5: from django.utils.module_loading import module_has_submodule\n   6: \n   7: \n   8: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n   9: def get_callable(lookup_view):\n  10:     \"\"\"\n  11:     Return a callable corresponding to lookup_view.\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nLines 63-69:\n  63:         )\n  64: \n  65: \n  66: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  67: def get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n  68:     if urlconf is None:\n  69:         urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nLines 70-76:\n  70:     return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n  71: \n  72: \n  73: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  74: def get_ns_resolver(ns_pattern, resolver, converters):\n  75:     # Build a namespaced resolver for the given parent URLconf pattern.\n  76:     # This makes it possible to have captured parameters in the parent\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect!

Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\n**The Bug Pattern:**\n1. `get_resolver(urlconf=None)` is called before any request handling (e.g., at import time)\n2. Since `urlconf=None`, it uses `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` \n3. Later, after `set_urlconf()` is called during request handling, `get_resolver()` is called again\n4. The first call gets cached with `None` as the key, the second with `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` as the key\n5. This results in two different URLResolver instances being created and cached, both doing expensive `_populate()` operations\n\n**The Root Cause:**\nThe current `get_resolver` function (lines 67-70 in resolvers.py) takes `urlconf` as a parameter and only resolves `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` inside the function. Since `functools.lru_cache` caches based on the input parameters, `get_resolver(None)` and `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` are treated as different cache entries.\n\n**The Solution:**\nThe proposed fix is to resolve `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` BEFORE the memoized function call, so that both scenarios result in the same cache key.\n\nLet me examine the current `get_resolver` implementation to see if it's using `functools.lru_cache` and understand the exact caching mechanism.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"lru_cache\", \"search_dir\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'lru_cache' (showing first 5 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/converters.py\nLines 1-5:\n   1: import uuid\n   2: from functools import lru_cache\n   3: \n   4: \n   5: class IntConverter:\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/converters.py\nLines 57-63:\n  57:     get_converters.cache_clear()\n  58: \n  59: \n  60: @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  61: def get_converters():\n  62:     return {**DEFAULT_CONVERTERS, **REGISTERED_CONVERTERS}\n  63: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/utils.py\nLines 5-11:\n   5: from django.utils.module_loading import module_has_submodule\n   6: \n   7: \n   8: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n   9: def get_callable(lookup_view):\n  10:     \"\"\"\n  11:     Return a callable corresponding to lookup_view.\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nLines 63-69:\n  63:         )\n  64: \n  65: \n  66: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  67: def get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n  68:     if urlconf is None:\n  69:         urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nLines 70-76:\n  70:     return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n  71: \n  72: \n  73: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  74: def get_ns_resolver(ns_pattern, resolver, converters):\n  75:     # Build a namespaced resolver for the given parent URLconf pattern.\n  76:     # This makes it possible to have captured parameters in the parent\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect!

Now I have complete understanding of the bug. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**The Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Current Implementation**: `get_resolver` is decorated with `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)` and takes `urlconf=None` as parameter\n2. **Cache Key Problem**: The cache key is based on the input parameter `urlconf`\n3. **Two Different Cache Entries**:\n   - When called early (import time): `get_resolver(None)` → cached with key `None`\n   - When called after request handling: `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` → cached with key `settings.ROOT_URLCONF`\n4. **Result**: Two separate URLResolver instances are created and cached, both calling expensive `URLResolver._populate()`\n\n**The Root Cause**: The `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution happens INSIDE the cached function, so the cache sees different input parameters as different cache entries.\n\n**The Fix**: Resolve `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` BEFORE the cached function call, so both scenarios use the same cache key.\n\nNow I need to identify the exact line ranges where the fix should be applied. Based on my analysis, the bug is in lines 66-70 of `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py`.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Location Analysis\n\nI have identified the precise location of the Django URLResolver optimization bug:\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py`\n**Lines**: 66-70\n\n**Current Problematic Code**:\n```python\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n```\n\n**Root Cause**: The `functools.lru_cache` decorator caches based on input parameters. When `get_resolver(None)` is called (e.g., at import time) versus `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` (after request handling), these are treated as different cache entries, causing two separate URLResolver instances to be created and cached.\n\n**Impact**: This results in multiple expensive `URLResolver._populate()` calls, which is wasteful for applications with large numbers of routes.\n\n**Required Fix**: The `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution needs to happen BEFORE the cached function call, ensuring both scenarios use the same cache key and share the same URLResolver instance.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django URLResolver optimization bug, I have identified the exact location where the fix needs to be applied. The problem is in the `get_resolver` function where the `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution happens inside the cached function, causing multiple cache entries for what should be the same URLconf.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 66,\n            \"end_line\": 70\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe bug is specifically in lines 66-70 where the `@functools.lru_cache` decorator and the `get_resolver` function implementation create separate cache entries for `get_resolver(None)` and `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)`, when they should resolve to the same URLResolver instance. The fix requires moving the `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution outside the cached function to ensure consistent cache keys.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context! The problem statement confirms my analysis exactly. The issue is that `get_resolver` gets called with different parameters (`None` initially, then `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` after request handling), causing two separate cache entries and two expensive `URLResolver._populate()` calls.\n\nThe proposed solution is to modify `get_resolver` to resolve `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before the memoized function call, ensuring consistent cache keys.\n\nLet me examine the current implementation one more time to understand exactly how to implement this fix.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\", \"start_line\": 60, \"end_line\": 75 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nTotal lines: 669\nShowing lines 60-75:\n\n  60:         return \"ResolverMatch(func=%s, args=%s, kwargs=%s, url_name=%s, app_names=%s, namespaces=%s, route=%s)\" % (\n  61:             self._func_path, self.args, self.kwargs, self.url_name,\n  62:             self.app_names, self.namespaces, self.route,\n  63:         )\n  64: \n  65: \n  66: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  67: def get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n  68:     if urlconf is None:\n  69:         urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n  70:     return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n  71: \n  72: \n  73: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  74: def get_ns_resolver(ns_pattern, resolver, converters):\n  75:     # Build a namespaced resolver for the given parent URLconf pattern.\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1. What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nOptimization: Multiple URLResolvers may be unintentionally be constructed by calls to `django.urls.resolvers.get_resolver`\nDescription\n\t\nMultiple URLResolvers may be constructed by django.urls.resolvers.get_resolver if django.urls.base.set_urlconf has not yet been called, resulting in multiple expensive calls to URLResolver._populate.\n​`get_resolver` constructs a new URLResolver, and caches it using functools.lru_cache.\nURLResolver instances can pre-compute a large amount of information about routes in ​`URLResolver._populate`, and they store those caches as instance variables.\n​`set_urlconf` is called with when ​we first handle a request in `BaseHandler.get_response`.\nget_resolver has a number of call-sites. Most notably, ​`reverse`. Like the other call-sites, reverse calls get_resolver with the result of get_urlconf.\nIf reverse (or anything else using get_resolver) is called both before (e.g. at import time) and after a request is handled, get_resolver will be called with different values. Initially it will be called with None, and later if will be called with settings.ROOT_URLCONF, because request handling calls set_urlconf.\nIn an application with a large number of routes, URLResolver._populate can be expensive, so calling it twice and storing those caches twice is wasteful.\nMy proposed solution is just to modify ​`get_resolver` to look up settings.ROOT_URLCONF before the memoized function call.\nI'm planning to contribute a fix, as soon as I can get the CLA signed.\n",

Since `functools.lru_cache` caches based on the input parameters, `get_resolver(None)` and `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` are treated as different cache entries.\n\n**The Solution:**\nThe proposed fix is to resolve `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` BEFORE the memoized function call, so that both scenarios result in the same cache key.\n\nLet me examine the current `get_resolver` implementation to see if it's using `functools.lru_cache` and understand the exact caching mechanism.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"lru_cache\", \"search_dir\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'lru_cache' (showing first 5 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/converters.py\nLines 1-5:\n   1: import uuid\n   2: from functools import lru_cache\n   3: \n   4: \n   5: class IntConverter:\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/converters.py\nLines 57-63:\n  57:     get_converters.cache_clear()\n  58: \n  59: \n  60: @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  61: def get_converters():\n  62:     return {**DEFAULT_CONVERTERS, **REGISTERED_CONVERTERS}\n  63: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/utils.py\nLines 5-11:\n   5: from django.utils.module_loading import module_has_submodule\n   6: \n   7: \n   8: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n   9: def get_callable(lookup_view):\n  10:     \"\"\"\n  11:     Return a callable corresponding to lookup_view.\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nLines 63-69:\n  63:         )\n  64: \n  65: \n  66: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  67: def get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n  68:     if urlconf is None:\n  69:         urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nLines 70-76:\n  70:     return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n  71: \n  72: \n  73: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  74: def get_ns_resolver(ns_pattern, resolver, converters):\n  75:     # Build a namespaced resolver for the given parent URLconf pattern.\n  76:     # This makes it possible to have captured parameters in the parent\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect!

Now I have complete understanding of the bug. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**The Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Current Implementation**: `get_resolver` is decorated with `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)` and takes `urlconf=None` as parameter\n2. **Cache Key Problem**: The cache key is based on the input parameter `urlconf`\n3. **Two Different Cache Entries**:\n   - When called early (import time): `get_resolver(None)` → cached with key `None`\n   - When called after request handling: `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` → cached with key `settings.ROOT_URLCONF`\n4. **Result**: Two separate URLResolver instances are created and cached, both calling expensive `URLResolver._populate()`\n\n**The Root Cause**: The `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution happens INSIDE the cached function, so the cache sees different input parameters as different cache entries.\n\n**The Fix**: Resolve `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` BEFORE the cached function call, so both scenarios use the same cache key.\n\nNow I need to identify the exact line ranges where the fix should be applied. Based on my analysis, the bug is in lines 66-70 of `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py`.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Location Analysis\n\nI have identified the precise location of the Django URLResolver optimization bug:\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py`\n**Lines**: 66-70\n\n**Current Problematic Code**:\n```python\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n```\n\n**Root Cause**: The `functools.lru_cache` decorator caches based on input parameters. When `get_resolver(None)` is called (e.g., at import time) versus `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` (after request handling), these are treated as different cache entries, causing two separate URLResolver instances to be created and cached.\n\n**Impact**: This results in multiple expensive `URLResolver._populate()` calls, which is wasteful for applications with large numbers of routes.\n\n**Required Fix**: The `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution needs to happen BEFORE the cached function call, ensuring both scenarios use the same cache key and share the same URLResolver instance.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django URLResolver optimization bug, I have identified the exact location where the fix needs to be applied. The problem is in the `get_resolver` function where the `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution happens inside the cached function, causing multiple cache entries for what should be the same URLconf.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 66,\n            \"end_line\": 70\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe bug is specifically in lines 66-70 where the `@functools.lru_cache` decorator and the `get_resolver` function implementation create separate cache entries for `get_resolver(None)` and `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)`, when they should resolve to the same URLResolver instance. The fix requires moving the `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution outside the cached function to ensure consistent cache keys.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context! The problem statement confirms my analysis exactly. The issue is that `get_resolver` gets called with different parameters (`None` initially, then `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` after request handling), causing two separate cache entries and two expensive `URLResolver._populate()` calls.\n\nThe proposed solution is to modify `get_resolver` to resolve `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before the memoized function call, ensuring consistent cache keys.\n\nLet me examine the current implementation one more time to understand exactly how to implement this fix.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\", \"start_line\": 60, \"end_line\": 75 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nTotal lines: 669\nShowing lines 60-75:\n\n  60:         return \"ResolverMatch(func=%s, args=%s, kwargs=%s, url_name=%s, app_names=%s, namespaces=%s, route=%s)\" % (\n  61:             self._func_path, self.args, self.kwargs, self.url_name,\n  62:             self.app_names, self.namespaces, self.route,\n  63:         )\n  64: \n  65: \n  66: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  67: def get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n  68:     if urlconf is None:\n  69:         urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n  70:     return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n  71: \n  72: \n  73: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  74: def get_ns_resolver(ns_pattern, resolver, converters):\n  75:     # Build a namespaced resolver for the given parent URLconf pattern.\n\nNow let me check the imports at the top of the resolvers.py file to understand what's available:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 20 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nTotal lines: 669\nShowing lines 1-20:\n\n   1: \"\"\"\n   2: This module converts requested URLs to callback view functions.\n   3: \n   4: URLResolver is the main class here.

Most notably, ​`reverse`. Like the other call-sites, reverse calls get_resolver with the result of get_urlconf.\nIf reverse (or anything else using get_resolver) is called both before (e.g. at import time) and after a request is handled, get_resolver will be called with different values. Initially it will be called with None, and later if will be called with settings.ROOT_URLCONF, because request handling calls set_urlconf.\nIn an application with a large number of routes, URLResolver._populate can be expensive, so calling it twice and storing those caches twice is wasteful.\nMy proposed solution is just to modify ​`get_resolver` to look up settings.ROOT_URLCONF before the memoized function call.\nI'm planning to contribute a fix, as soon as I can get the CLA signed.\n",
    "response": "Perfect! Now I have all the context I need. Let me analyze the situation and propose the fix.\n\n**PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS**\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django URLResolver optimization bug, I can see the exact problem and solution:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe current `get_resolver` function is decorated with `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)` and resolves `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` inside the cached function. This causes two separate cache entries:\n1. `get_resolver(None)` - called at import time before any request handling\n2. `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` - called after `set_urlconf` during request handling\n\nBoth create separate URLResolver instances, each calling the expensive `URLResolver._populate()` method.\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe solution is to resolve `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before the memoized function call, ensuring both scenarios use the same cache key and share the same URLResolver instance.\n\n**Repair Suggestion:**\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py, lines 66-70]**: Replace the current implementation with a wrapper function that resolves `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before calling the cached function:\n\n```python\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef _get_resolver(urlconf):\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n\n\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return _get_resolver(urlconf)\n```\n\n**How this fix works:**\n- The actual caching happens in `_get_resolver(urlconf)` which only receives resolved URLconf strings\n- The public `get_resolver(urlconf=None)` function handles the `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution before calling the cached function\n- Both `get_resolver(None)` and `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` will result in the same call to `_get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)`\n- This ensures only one URLResolver instance is created and cached for the same URLconf, eliminating the duplicate expensive `_populate()` calls\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Eliminates duplicate URLResolver instances for the same URLconf\n- Reduces expensive `URLResolver._populate()` calls from 2 to 1\n- Maintains backward compatibility - the public API remains unchanged\n- Preserves all existing functionality while optimizing performance\n\nThis fix directly addresses the performance issue described in the problem statement where applications with large numbers of routes experience wasteful duplicate URLResolver construction and population.",

The issue appears to be related to caching mechanisms in the `get_resolver` function and how it interacts with thread-local URL configuration changes.\n\n## Key Technical Analysis Completed\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Target**: Django project located at `/root/hy/projects/django`\n- **Focus Area**: URL resolution system in `django/urls/` module\n- **Key Files Identified**:\n  - `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py` - Contains URLResolver class and get_resolver function\n  - `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/base.py` - Contains thread-local URL configuration management\n\n### 2. Current Implementation Analysis\n\n#### `get_resolver` Function (resolvers.py, lines 67-70):\n```python\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n```\n\n#### Thread-Local URL Configuration System (base.py):\n- **`_urlconfs`**: Thread-local storage for overridden URLconfs (line 19)\n- **`set_urlconf(urlconf_name)`**: Sets thread-specific URLconf (lines 127-136)\n- **`get_urlconf(default=None)`**: Retrieves thread-specific URLconf (lines 139-144)\n\n#### Integration Points:\n- `resolve()` function (base.py, lines 22-25) calls `get_urlconf()` then `get_resolver(urlconf)`\n- `reverse()` function (base.py, lines 28-31) follows same pattern\n\n## Identified Problem Pattern\nThe current `get_resolver` function creates a new URLResolver instance every time it's called, which suggests:\n\n1. **No Caching**: Each call to `get_resolver` creates a new URLResolver instance\n2. **Thread-Local Disconnect**: The function doesn't properly integrate with the thread-local URLconf system (`_urlconfs`)\n3. **Performance Issue**: Repeated URLResolver instantiation for the same URLconf\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Project structure analysis\n- ✅ **Completed**: Core function identification and analysis\n- ✅ **Completed**: Thread-local system understanding\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Bug pattern identification\n- ❌ **Pending**: Detailed URLResolver class analysis\n- ❌ **Pending**: Caching mechanism implementation\n- ❌ **Pending**: Bug fix and testing\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine URLResolver Class**: Analyze the full URLResolver implementation to understand its caching capabilities\n2. **Identify Caching Strategy**: Determine how to implement proper caching that respects thread-local URLconf changes\n3. **Implement Fix**: Modify `get_resolver` to cache URLResolver instances while properly handling thread-local overrides\n4. **Test Integration**: Ensure the fix works with `set_urlconf`/`get_urlconf` thread-local system\n\n## Technical Considerations\n- **Thread Safety**: Any caching solution must respect thread-local URLconf overrides\n- **Memory Management**: Cached resolvers should be properly cleaned up\n- **Performance**: The fix should improve performance without breaking existing functionality\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Changes should not affect the public API\n\nThe bug appears to be a missing optimization where URLResolver instances should be cached and reused, but the current implementation creates new instances on every call, potentially causing performance issues in high-traffic scenarios.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: Now let me examine the `get_urlconf` function to understand how it works with `set_urlconf`.\n\n#TOOL_CALL find_methods_by_name { \"name\": \"get_urlconf\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\n[{'absolute_path': '/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/base.py', 'full_qualified_name': 'django.urls.base.get_urlconf', 'content': ' 139: def get_urlconf(default=None):\\n 140:     \"\"\"\\n 141:     Return the root URLconf to use for the current thread if it has been\\n 142:     changed from the default one.\\n 143:     \"\"\"\\n 144:     return getattr(_urlconfs, \"value\", default)', 'start_line': 139, 'end_line': 144, 'analysis_header': '=== RELATIONSHIPS ANALYSIS ===', 'relationships': {'BELONGS_TO': [], 'CALLS': [], 'HAS_METHOD': [], 'HAS_VARIABLE': [], 'INHERITS': [], 'REFERENCES': []}}]\n\nAssistant: Now let me examine the `_urlconfs` variable and understand how the thread-local storage works in the base.py file.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/base.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/base.py\nTotal lines: 180\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: from urllib.parse import urlsplit, urlunsplit\n   2: \n   3: from asgiref.local import Local\n   4: \n   5: from django.utils.encoding import iri_to_uri\n   6: from django.utils.functional import lazy\n   7: from django.utils.translation import override\n   8: \n   9: from .exceptions import NoReverseMatch, Resolver404\n  10: from .resolvers import get_ns_resolver, get_resolver\n  11: from .utils import get_callable\n  12: \n  13: # SCRIPT_NAME prefixes for each thread are stored here.

Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\n**The Bug Pattern:**\n1. `get_resolver(urlconf=None)` is called before any request handling (e.g., at import time)\n2. Since `urlconf=None`, it uses `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` \n3. Later, after `set_urlconf()` is called during request handling, `get_resolver()` is called again\n4. The first call gets cached with `None` as the key, the second with `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` as the key\n5. This results in two different URLResolver instances being created and cached, both doing expensive `_populate()` operations\n\n**The Root Cause:**\nThe current `get_resolver` function (lines 67-70 in resolvers.py) takes `urlconf` as a parameter and only resolves `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` inside the function. Since `functools.lru_cache` caches based on the input parameters, `get_resolver(None)` and `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` are treated as different cache entries.\n\n**The Solution:**\nThe proposed fix is to resolve `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` BEFORE the memoized function call, so that both scenarios result in the same cache key.\n\nLet me examine the current `get_resolver` implementation to see if it's using `functools.lru_cache` and understand the exact caching mechanism.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"lru_cache\", \"search_dir\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'lru_cache' (showing first 5 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/converters.py\nLines 1-5:\n   1: import uuid\n   2: from functools import lru_cache\n   3: \n   4: \n   5: class IntConverter:\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/converters.py\nLines 57-63:\n  57:     get_converters.cache_clear()\n  58: \n  59: \n  60: @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  61: def get_converters():\n  62:     return {**DEFAULT_CONVERTERS, **REGISTERED_CONVERTERS}\n  63: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/utils.py\nLines 5-11:\n   5: from django.utils.module_loading import module_has_submodule\n   6: \n   7: \n   8: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n   9: def get_callable(lookup_view):\n  10:     \"\"\"\n  11:     Return a callable corresponding to lookup_view.\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nLines 63-69:\n  63:         )\n  64: \n  65: \n  66: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  67: def get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n  68:     if urlconf is None:\n  69:         urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nLines 70-76:\n  70:     return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n  71: \n  72: \n  73: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  74: def get_ns_resolver(ns_pattern, resolver, converters):\n  75:     # Build a namespaced resolver for the given parent URLconf pattern.\n  76:     # This makes it possible to have captured parameters in the parent\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: Perfect!

Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**The Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Current Implementation**: `get_resolver` is decorated with `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)` and takes `urlconf=None` as parameter\n2. **Cache Key Problem**: The cache key is based on the input parameter `urlconf`\n3. **Two Different Cache Entries**:\n   - When called early (import time): `get_resolver(None)` → cached with key `None`\n   - When called after request handling: `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` → cached with key `settings.ROOT_URLCONF`\n4. **Result**: Two separate URLResolver instances are created and cached, both calling expensive `URLResolver._populate()`\n\n**The Root Cause**: The `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution happens INSIDE the cached function, so the cache sees different input parameters as different cache entries.\n\n**The Fix**: Resolve `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` BEFORE the cached function call, so both scenarios use the same cache key.\n\nNow I need to identify the exact line ranges where the fix should be applied. Based on my analysis, the bug is in lines 66-70 of `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py`.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Location Analysis\n\nI have identified the precise location of the Django URLResolver optimization bug:\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py`\n**Lines**: 66-70\n\n**Current Problematic Code**:\n```python\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n```\n\n**Root Cause**: The `functools.lru_cache` decorator caches based on input parameters. When `get_resolver(None)` is called (e.g., at import time) versus `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` (after request handling), these are treated as different cache entries, causing two separate URLResolver instances to be created and cached.\n\n**Impact**: This results in multiple expensive `URLResolver._populate()` calls, which is wasteful for applications with large numbers of routes.\n\n**Required Fix**: The `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution needs to happen BEFORE the cached function call, ensuring both scenarios use the same cache key and share the same URLResolver instance.\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: **PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django URLResolver optimization bug, I have identified the exact location where the fix needs to be applied. The problem is in the `get_resolver` function where the `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution happens inside the cached function, causing multiple cache entries for what should be the same URLconf.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 66,\n            \"end_line\": 70\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe bug is specifically in lines 66-70 where the `@functools.lru_cache` decorator and the `get_resolver` function implementation create separate cache entries for `get_resolver(None)` and `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)`, when they should resolve to the same URLResolver instance. The fix requires moving the `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution outside the cached function to ensure consistent cache keys.\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context! The problem statement confirms my analysis exactly. The issue is that `get_resolver` gets called with different parameters (`None` initially, then `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` after request handling), causing two separate cache entries and two expensive `URLResolver._populate()` calls.\n\nThe proposed solution is to modify `get_resolver` to resolve `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before the memoized function call, ensuring consistent cache keys.\n\nLet me examine the current implementation one more time to understand exactly how to implement this fix.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\", \"start_line\": 60, \"end_line\": 75 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nTotal lines: 669\nShowing lines 60-75:\n\n  60:         return \"ResolverMatch(func=%s, args=%s, kwargs=%s, url_name=%s, app_names=%s, namespaces=%s, route=%s)\" % (\n  61:             self._func_path, self.args, self.kwargs, self.url_name,\n  62:             self.app_names, self.namespaces, self.route,\n  63:         )\n  64: \n  65: \n  66: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  67: def get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n  68:     if urlconf is None:\n  69:         urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n  70:     return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n  71: \n  72: \n  73: @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n  74: def get_ns_resolver(ns_pattern, resolver, converters):\n  75:     # Build a namespaced resolver for the given parent URLconf pattern.\n\n\nAssistant: Now let me check the imports at the top of the resolvers.py file to understand what's available:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 20 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nTotal lines: 669\nShowing lines 1-20:\n\n   1: \"\"\"\n   2: This module converts requested URLs to callback view functions.\n   3: \n   4: URLResolver is the main class here.

Now I have all the context I need. Let me analyze the situation and propose the fix.\n\n**PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS**\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django URLResolver optimization bug, I can see the exact problem and solution:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe current `get_resolver` function is decorated with `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)` and resolves `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` inside the cached function. This causes two separate cache entries:\n1. `get_resolver(None)` - called at import time before any request handling\n2. `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` - called after `set_urlconf` during request handling\n\nBoth create separate URLResolver instances, each calling the expensive `URLResolver._populate()` method.\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe solution is to resolve `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before the memoized function call, ensuring both scenarios use the same cache key and share the same URLResolver instance.\n\n**Repair Suggestion:**\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py, lines 66-70]**: Replace the current implementation with a wrapper function that resolves `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before calling the cached function:\n\n```python\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef _get_resolver(urlconf):\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n\n\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return _get_resolver(urlconf)\n```\n\n**How this fix works:**\n- The actual caching happens in `_get_resolver(urlconf)` which only receives resolved URLconf strings\n- The public `get_resolver(urlconf=None)` function handles the `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution before calling the cached function\n- Both `get_resolver(None)` and `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` will result in the same call to `_get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)`\n- This ensures only one URLResolver instance is created and cached for the same URLconf, eliminating the duplicate expensive `_populate()` calls\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Eliminates duplicate URLResolver instances for the same URLconf\n- Reduces expensive `URLResolver._populate()` calls from 2 to 1\n- Maintains backward compatibility - the public API remains unchanged\n- Preserves all existing functionality while optimizing performance\n\nThis fix directly addresses the performance issue described in the problem statement where applications with large numbers of routes experience wasteful duplicate URLResolver construction and population.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py lines 66-70\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that:\n1.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django URLResolver Optimization Bug Analysis - Complete Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in Django's URLResolver optimization system. The issue is related to caching mechanisms in the `get_resolver` function causing duplicate URLResolver instances and expensive `_populate()` calls.\n\n## Complete Technical Analysis\n\n### 1. Project Structure and Key Files\n- **Target**: Django project at `/root/hy/projects/django`\n- **Primary Bug Location**: `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py` (lines 66-70)\n- **Supporting Files**:\n  - `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/base.py` - Thread-local URL configuration management\n  - Contains `_urlconfs` (Local storage), `set_urlconf()`, `get_urlconf()` functions\n\n### 2. Bug Root Cause Analysis - CONFIRMED\n\n#### Current Problematic Implementation (resolvers.py, lines 66-70):\n```python\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n```\n\n#### The Exact Problem:\n1. **Cache Key Issue**: `functools.lru_cache` caches based on input parameters\n2. **Two Different Cache Entries Created**:\n   - `get_resolver(None)` - called at import time before request handling\n   - `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` - called after `set_urlconf()` during request handling\n3. **Result**: Two separate URLResolver instances are created and cached\n4. **Performance Impact**: Each instance calls expensive `URLResolver._populate()` method\n\n#### Integration with Thread-Local System:\n- `resolve()` function (base.py, lines 22-25): calls `get_urlconf()` then `get_resolver(urlconf)`\n- `reverse()` function (base.py, lines 28-31): follows same pattern\n- Thread-local storage uses `asgiref.local.Local` for `_urlconfs` variable\n\n### 3. Confirmed Solution Strategy\n\n#### The Fix Approach:\nMove the `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution OUTSIDE the cached function to ensure consistent cache keys.\n\n#### Proposed Implementation:\n```python\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef _get_resolver(urlconf):\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return _get_resolver(urlconf)\n```\n\n#### How This Fixes the Bug:\n- The actual caching happens in `_get_resolver(urlconf)` which only receives resolved URLconf strings\n- Both `get_resolver(None)` and `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` result in the same call to `_get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)`\n- Only one URLResolver instance is created and cached per unique URLconf\n- Eliminates duplicate expensive `_populate()` calls\n\n### 4. Technical Verification Completed\n\n#### Imports Available (resolvers.py, lines 1-20):\n- `functools` - for lru_cache decorator ✅\n- `django.conf.settings` - for ROOT_URLCONF access ✅\n- All necessary dependencies confirmed present\n\n#### Current Function Context:\n- Function is properly decorated with `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)`\n- Located between other resolver functions (lines 60-75)\n- No conflicting function names in the module\n\n### 5. Impact Assessment\n\n#### Benefits of the Fix:\n- **Performance**: Eliminates duplicate URLResolver instances for same URLconf\n- **Memory**: Reduces memory usage by preventing duplicate caching\n- **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility - public API unchanged\n- **Scalability**: Particularly beneficial for applications with large numbers of routes\n\n#### Risk Assessment:\n- **Low Risk**: The fix is a refactoring that preserves all existing functionality\n- **No API Changes**: Public interface of `get_resolver()` remains identical\n- **Thread Safety**: Maintains existing thread-local behavior\n\n## Current Status: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### ✅ **COMPLETED ANALYSIS**:\n- Project structure exploration\n- Bug location identification (lines 66-70 in resolvers.py)\n- Root cause analysis (cache key inconsistency)\n- Solution design and verification\n- Import dependencies confirmation\n- Risk assessment\n\n### 🎯 **CONFIRMED BUG LOCATION**:\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py`\n**Lines**: 66-70\n**Status**: Ready for fixing\n\n### 📋 **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n1. Replace current `get_resolver` function with wrapper pattern\n2. Create internal `_get_resolver` function with caching\n3. Maintain public `get_resolver` API for backward compatibility\n4. Ensure consistent cache keys for same URLconf values\n\n## Decision Point: READY TO PROCEED\n\nThe bug location has been precisely identified, the root cause is fully understood, and the solution has been designed and verified. The code segment at lines 66-70 in `/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py` is ready for the proposed fix.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe analysis is complete and the location is confirmed ready for implementation. The fix will resolve the URLResolver optimization bug by ensuring consistent cache keys and eliminating duplicate expensive URLResolver instantiation and population operations.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py\nStart line: 66\nEnd line: 70\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nPerfect!

I need to create a wrapper pattern where the actual caching happens in an internal function that only receives resolved URLconf strings.\n\nLooking at the indentation, the functions are at the module level (no leading whitespace), so my patch should also be flush-left.\n\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef _get_resolver(urlconf):\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n\n\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return _get_resolver(urlconf)\n```",

Now I have all the context I need. Let me analyze the situation and propose the fix.\n\n**S**\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django URLResolver optimization bug, I can see the exact problem and solution:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe current `get_resolver` function is decorated with `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)` and resolves `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` inside the cached function. This causes two separate cache entries:\n1. `get_resolver(None)` - called at import time before any request handling\n2. `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` - called after `set_urlconf` during request handling\n\nBoth create separate URLResolver instances, each calling the expensive `URLResolver._populate()` method.\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe solution is to resolve `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before the memoized function call, ensuring both scenarios use the same cache key and share the same URLResolver instance.\n\n**Repair Suggestion:**\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects/django/django/urls/resolvers.py, lines 66-70]**: Replace the current implementation with a wrapper function that resolves `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before calling the cached function:\n\n```python\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef _get_resolver(urlconf):\n    return URLResolver(RegexPattern(r'^/'), urlconf)\n\n\ndef get_resolver(urlconf=None):\n    if urlconf is None:\n        urlconf = settings.ROOT_URLCONF\n    return _get_resolver(urlconf)\n```\n\n**How this fix works:**\n- The actual caching happens in `_get_resolver(urlconf)` which only receives resolved URLconf strings\n- The public `get_resolver(urlconf=None)` function handles the `None` to `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` resolution before calling the cached function\n- Both `get_resolver(None)` and `get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)` will result in the same call to `_get_resolver(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)`\n- This ensures only one URLResolver instance is created and cached for the same URLconf, eliminating the duplicate expensive `_populate()` calls\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Eliminates duplicate URLResolver instances for the same URLconf\n- Reduces expensive `URLResolver._populate()` calls from 2 to 1\n- Maintains backward compatibility - the public API remains unchanged\n- Preserves all existing functionality while optimizing performance\n\nThis fix directly addresses the performance issue described in the problem statement where applications with large numbers of routes experience wasteful duplicate URLResolver construction and population.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",
