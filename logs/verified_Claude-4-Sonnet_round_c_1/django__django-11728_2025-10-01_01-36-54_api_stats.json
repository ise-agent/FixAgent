Bug Location Identified\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects/django/django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`\n- **Function**: `replace_named_groups()` (lines 153-187)\n- **Related Pattern**: `named_group_matcher = re.compile(r'\\(\\?P(<\\w+>)')` (line 149)\n\n### 2. Problem Analysis\n**Reported Issue**:\n- Input pattern: `r'entries/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/relationships/(?P<related_field>\\w+)'`\n- The \"related_field\" group doesn't get properly replaced\n- Workaround: adding a trailing '/' fixes the issue\n- Affects Django REST Framework functionality\n\n### 3. Code Structure Analysis\nThe `replace_named_groups()` function works by:\n1. Finding all named groups using `named_group_matcher.finditer(pattern)`\n2. For each group, tracking bracket balance to find the complete group pattern\n3. Building a list of `(group_pattern, group_name)` tuples\n4. Replacing each group pattern with its name using `pattern.replace()`\n\n### 4. Critical Discovery - Potential Bug Location\nThe algorithm uses bracket counting to determine where each named group ends:\n```python\nfor idx, val in enumerate(pattern[end:]):\n    if unmatched_open_brackets == 0:\n        group_pattern_and_name.append((pattern[start:end + idx], group_name))\n        break\n```\n\n**Suspected Issue**: When there's no trailing character after the final named group, the loop may not properly detect the end of the pattern, causing the final group to be missed or incorrectly processed.\n\n## Current Status\n- ✅ Located the problematic function and its implementation\n- ✅ Identified the bracket-counting algorithm as the likely source of the bug\n- ❌ `simplify_regexp()` function not found (may not exist or be named differently)\n- ⏳ **Next Steps Needed**: \n  1.

    "response": "Based on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I have identified the exact bug location and root cause.\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**Root Cause**: The `replace_named_groups()` function fails to handle the case where a named group is at the very end of the pattern string. The bracket-counting algorithm (lines 169-182) never finds the closing bracket for the final named group because there are no characters after it to process.\n\n**Specific Issue**: \n- The loop starts with `unmatched_open_brackets = 1` (line 168)\n- It iterates through `pattern[end:]` looking for the closing bracket\n- For patterns ending with a named group like `(?P<related_field>\\w+)`, there are no characters after the group\n- The loop exits without ever finding `unmatched_open_brackets == 0`\n- Therefore, the final group never gets added to `group_pattern_and_name`\n- The replacement step (lines 185-186) skips this group entirely\n\n## Bug Locations\n\nThe bug requires fixes in these specific locations:\n\n1. **Lines 169-182**: The main bracket-counting loop that fails to handle end-of-pattern scenarios\n2. **Lines 183-184**: Need to add logic after the loop to handle the case where we reach the end of the pattern while still inside a named group\n3. **Line 168**: The initialization logic that sets up the bracket counting\n4. **Lines 172-174**: The condition that determines when to add a group to the replacement list\n5. **Lines 166-183**: The entire outer loop structure that processes each named group\n\nThe fix needs to add logic after line 182 to check if we've reached the end of the pattern string while `unmatched_open_brackets > 0`, and if so, include the remaining pattern as part of the current named group.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**",

Bug Location Identified\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects/django/django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`\n- **Function**: `replace_named_groups()` (lines 153-187)\n- **Related Pattern**: `named_group_matcher = re.compile(r'\\(\\?P(<\\w+>)')` (line 149)\n\n### 2. Problem Analysis\n**Reported Issue**:\n- Input pattern: `r'entries/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/relationships/(?P<related_field>\\w+)'`\n- The \"related_field\" group doesn't get properly replaced\n- Workaround: adding a trailing '/' fixes the issue\n- Affects Django REST Framework functionality\n\n### 3. Code Structure Analysis\nThe `replace_named_groups()` function works by:\n1. Finding all named groups using `named_group_matcher.finditer(pattern)`\n2. For each group, tracking bracket balance to find the complete group pattern\n3. Building a list of `(group_pattern, group_name)` tuples\n4. Replacing each group pattern with its name using `pattern.replace()`\n\n### 4. Critical Discovery - Potential Bug Location\nThe algorithm uses bracket counting to determine where each named group ends:\n```python\nfor idx, val in enumerate(pattern[end:]):\n    if unmatched_open_brackets == 0:\n        group_pattern_and_name.append((pattern[start:end + idx], group_name))\n        break\n```\n\n**Suspected Issue**: When there's no trailing character after the final named group, the loop may not properly detect the end of the pattern, causing the final group to be missed or incorrectly processed.\n\n## Current Status\n- ✅ Located the problematic function and its implementation\n- ✅ Identified the bracket-counting algorithm as the likely source of the bug\n- ❌ `simplify_regexp()` function not found (may not exist or be named differently)\n- ⏳ **Next Steps Needed**: \n  1. Create a test case to reproduce the bug\n  2. Debug the bracket counting logic for patterns without trailing characters\n  3.

Let me analyze the specific issue:\n\n**Bug Analysis**:\n1. **Location**: Lines 169-182 in the `replace_named_groups()` function\n2. **Root Cause**: The bracket-counting loop doesn't handle the case where we reach the end of the pattern string while still processing a named group\n3. **Specific Issue**: When processing `r'entries/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/relationships/(?P<related_field>\\w+)'`, the final group `(?P<related_field>\\w+)` never gets its closing bracket counted because there are no characters after it\n4. **Missing Logic**: The loop needs to handle the case where `idx` reaches the end of `pattern[end:]` while `unmatched_open_brackets > 0`\n\n**The Fix**: After the loop (around line 182), we need to add logic to handle the case where we've reached the end of the pattern but still have an unmatched opening bracket from the current named group.\n\nLet me examine the exact line ranges that need to be fixed:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\", \"start_line\": 165, \"end_line\": 187 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\nTotal lines: 237\nShowing lines 165-187:\n\n 165:     # Loop over the groups and their start and end indices.\n 166:     for start, end, group_name in named_group_indices:\n 167:         # Handle nested parentheses, e.g. '^(?P<a>(x|y))/b'.\n 168:         unmatched_open_brackets, prev_char = 1, None\n 169:         for idx, val in enumerate(pattern[end:]):\n 170:             # If brackets are balanced, the end of the string for the current\n 171:             # named capture group pattern has been reached.\n 172:             if unmatched_open_brackets == 0:\n 173:                 group_pattern_and_name.append((pattern[start:end + idx], group_name))\n 174:                 break\n 175: \n 176:             # Check for unescaped `(` and `)`.

The bracket-counting algorithm (lines 169-182) never finds the closing bracket for the final named group because there are no characters after it to process.\n\n**Specific Issue**: \n- The loop starts with `unmatched_open_brackets = 1` (line 168)\n- It iterates through `pattern[end:]` looking for the closing bracket\n- For patterns ending with a named group like `(?P<related_field>\\w+)`, there are no characters after the group\n- The loop exits without ever finding `unmatched_open_brackets == 0`\n- Therefore, the final group never gets added to `group_pattern_and_name`\n- The replacement step (lines 185-186) skips this group entirely\n\n## Bug Locations\n\nThe bug requires fixes in these specific locations:\n\n1. **Lines 169-182**: The main bracket-counting loop that fails to handle end-of-pattern scenarios\n2. **Lines 183-184**: Need to add logic after the loop to handle the case where we reach the end of the pattern while still inside a named group\n3. **Line 168**: The initialization logic that sets up the bracket counting\n4. **Lines 172-174**: The condition that determines when to add a group to the replacement list\n5. **Lines 166-183**: The entire outer loop structure that processes each named group\n\nThe fix needs to add logic after line 182 to check if we've reached the end of the pattern string while `unmatched_open_brackets > 0`, and if so, include the remaining pattern as part of the current named group.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the `replace_named_groups()` function, I have identified the exact bug location and root cause. The issue is in the bracket-counting algorithm that fails to handle named groups at the end of the pattern string.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 169,\n            \"end_line\": 182\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe bug is specifically in the bracket-counting loop (lines 169-182) where the algorithm fails to handle the case when a named group appears at the very end of the pattern string. The loop exits without ever finding `unmatched_open_brackets == 0` for the final group, causing it to never be added to `group_pattern_and_name` and therefore never replaced in the final step.\n\nThe fix requires adding logic after line 182 to check if we've reached the end of the pattern while still inside a named group (`unmatched_open_brackets > 0`) and handle that case appropriately.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nsimplify_regexp() doesn't replace trailing groups.\nDescription\n\t\nreplace_named_groups() fails to replace the final named group if the urlpattern passed in is missing a trailing '/'.\nFor example, with input r'entries/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/relationships/(?P<related_field>\\w+)' the \"related_field\" does not get properly replaced. A workaround is to tack on a '/' at the end and then it works.\nCode that reproduces this is attached. \nThis function is used downstream in Django REST Framework. See issue ​6888\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context. The problem is indeed in the `replace_named_groups()` function, and the issue is exactly what I identified: when a named group appears at the very end of a pattern (without a trailing '/'), the bracket-counting algorithm fails to properly close the group and add it to the replacement list.\n\nThe bug location I identified (lines 169-182) is correct. The algorithm starts with `unmatched_open_brackets = 1` and looks for characters after the named group to find the closing bracket. When there's no trailing character, the loop never finds the condition where `unmatched_open_brackets == 0`, so the final group never gets processed.\n\nLet me now provide the repair suggestions.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Bug location [lines 169-182]**: Add logic after the bracket-counting loop to handle the case where we reach the end of the pattern while still inside a named group. Specifically, after line 182, add a check: if we've exited the loop without finding balanced brackets (i.e., `unmatched_open_brackets > 0`), then we've reached the end of the pattern and should include the remaining pattern from `start` to the end as the complete group pattern. This ensures that final named groups without trailing characters get properly captured and added to `group_pattern_and_name` for replacement.\n\nThe fix should be:\n```python\n# After line 182, add:\nelse:\n    # If we've reached the end of the pattern while still inside a named group,\n    # include the remaining pattern as the complete group pattern\n    if unmatched_open_brackets > 0:\n        group_pattern_and_name.append((pattern[start:], group_name))\n```\n\nThis handles the case where patterns like `r'entries/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/relationships/(?P<related_field>\\w+)'` have their final named group `(?P<related_field>\\w+)` properly captured and replaced, since there are no characters after the closing bracket to process in the loop.",

Looking at the `replace_named_groups()` function, I've identified the critical issue:\n\n**The Bug**: In the bracket-counting loop (lines 169-182), when processing the final named group in a pattern that doesn't end with a trailing character, the loop iterates through `pattern[end:]` but never finds a condition where `unmatched_open_brackets == 0` because it reaches the end of the string while still having `unmatched_open_brackets = 1`.\n\n**Specific Problem**: \n- The loop starts with `unmatched_open_brackets = 1` (line 168)\n- It only appends to `group_pattern_and_name` when `unmatched_open_brackets == 0` (lines 172-174)\n- For the final group without trailing characters, the loop ends without ever decrementing `unmatched_open_brackets` to 0\n- This means the final named group never gets added to `group_pattern_and_name`\n- Therefore, it never gets replaced in the final step (lines 185-186)\n\n**The Fix Location**: The issue is in the bracket-counting loop that needs to handle the case where we reach the end of the pattern string while still inside a named group.\n\nLet me now look for any existing tests for this function to understand the expected behavior better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"replace_named_groups\", \"search_dir\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/tests\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'replace_named_groups' in directory '/root/hy/projects/django/tests'\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug. Let me analyze the specific issue:\n\n**Bug Analysis**:\n1. **Location**: Lines 169-182 in the `replace_named_groups()` function\n2. **Root Cause**: The bracket-counting loop doesn't handle the case where we reach the end of the pattern string while still processing a named group\n3. **Specific Issue**: When processing `r'entries/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/relationships/(?P<related_field>\\w+)'`, the final group `(?P<related_field>\\w+)` never gets its closing bracket counted because there are no characters after it\n4. **Missing Logic**: The loop needs to handle the case where `idx` reaches the end of `pattern[end:]` while `unmatched_open_brackets > 0`\n\n**The Fix**: After the loop (around line 182), we need to add logic to handle the case where we've reached the end of the pattern but still have an unmatched opening bracket from the current named group.\n\nLet me examine the exact line ranges that need to be fixed:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\", \"start_line\": 165, \"end_line\": 187 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects/django/django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\nTotal lines: 237\nShowing lines 165-187:\n\n 165:     # Loop over the groups and their start and end indices.\n 166:     for start, end, group_name in named_group_indices:\n 167:         # Handle nested parentheses, e.g. '^(?P<a>(x|y))/b'.\n 168:         unmatched_open_brackets, prev_char = 1, None\n 169:         for idx, val in enumerate(pattern[end:]):\n 170:             # If brackets are balanced, the end of the string for the current\n 171:             # named capture group pattern has been reached.\n 172:             if unmatched_open_brackets == 0:\n 173:                 group_pattern_and_name.append((pattern[start:end + idx], group_name))\n 174:                 break\n 175: \n 176:             # Check for unescaped `(` and `)`.

The bracket-counting algorithm (lines 169-182) never finds the closing bracket for the final named group because there are no characters after it to process.\n\n**Specific Issue**: \n- The loop starts with `unmatched_open_brackets = 1` (line 168)\n- It iterates through `pattern[end:]` looking for the closing bracket\n- For patterns ending with a named group like `(?P<related_field>\\w+)`, there are no characters after the group\n- The loop exits without ever finding `unmatched_open_brackets == 0`\n- Therefore, the final group never gets added to `group_pattern_and_name`\n- The replacement step (lines 185-186) skips this group entirely\n\n## Bug Locations\n\nThe bug requires fixes in these specific locations:\n\n1. **Lines 169-182**: The main bracket-counting loop that fails to handle end-of-pattern scenarios\n2. **Lines 183-184**: Need to add logic after the loop to handle the case where we reach the end of the pattern while still inside a named group\n3. **Line 168**: The initialization logic that sets up the bracket counting\n4. **Lines 172-174**: The condition that determines when to add a group to the replacement list\n5. **Lines 166-183**: The entire outer loop structure that processes each named group\n\nThe fix needs to add logic after line 182 to check if we've reached the end of the pattern string while `unmatched_open_brackets > 0`, and if so, include the remaining pattern as part of the current named group.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the `replace_named_groups()` function, I have identified the exact bug location and root cause. The issue is in the bracket-counting algorithm that fails to handle named groups at the end of the pattern string.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/django/django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 169,\n            \"end_line\": 182\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe bug is specifically in the bracket-counting loop (lines 169-182) where the algorithm fails to handle the case when a named group appears at the very end of the pattern string. The loop exits without ever finding `unmatched_open_brackets == 0` for the final group, causing it to never be added to `group_pattern_and_name` and therefore never replaced in the final step.\n\nThe fix requires adding logic after line 182 to check if we've reached the end of the pattern while still inside a named group (`unmatched_open_brackets > 0`) and handle that case appropriately.\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context. The problem is indeed in the `replace_named_groups()` function, and the issue is exactly what I identified: when a named group appears at the very end of a pattern (without a trailing '/'), the bracket-counting algorithm fails to properly close the group and add it to the replacement list.\n\nThe bug location I identified (lines 169-182) is correct. The algorithm starts with `unmatched_open_brackets = 1` and looks for characters after the named group to find the closing bracket. When there's no trailing character, the loop never finds the condition where `unmatched_open_brackets == 0`, so the final group never gets processed.\n\nLet me now provide the repair suggestions.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Bug location [lines 169-182]**: Add logic after the bracket-counting loop to handle the case where we reach the end of the pattern while still inside a named group. Specifically, after line 182, add a check: if we've exited the loop without finding balanced brackets (i.e., `unmatched_open_brackets > 0`), then we've reached the end of the pattern and should include the remaining pattern from `start` to the end as the complete group pattern. This ensures that final named groups without trailing characters get properly captured and added to `group_pattern_and_name` for replacement.\n\nThe fix should be:\n```python\n# After line 182, add:\nelse:\n    # If we've reached the end of the pattern while still inside a named group,\n    # include the remaining pattern as the complete group pattern\n    if unmatched_open_brackets > 0:\n        group_pattern_and_name.append((pattern[start:], group_name))\n```\n\nThis handles the case where patterns like `r'entries/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/relationships/(?P<related_field>\\w+)'` have their final named group `(?P<related_field>\\w+)` properly captured and replaced, since there are no characters after the closing bracket to process in the loop.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects/django/django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py lines 169-182\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        for idx, val in enumerate(pattern[end:]):\n            # If brackets are balanced, the end of the string for the current\n            # named capture group pattern has been reached.\n            if unmatched_open_brackets == 0:\n                group_pattern_and_name.append((pattern[start:end + idx], group_name))\n                break\n\n            # Check for unescaped `(` and `)`. They mark the start and end of a\n            # nested group.\n            if val == '(' and prev_char != '\\\\':\n                unmatched_open_brackets += 1\n            elif val == ')' and prev_char != '\\\\':\n                unmatched_open_brackets -= 1\n            prev_char = val\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that:\n1.

Bug Location Confirmed\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects/django/django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`\n- **Function**: `replace_named_groups()` (lines 153-187)\n- **Critical Bug Location**: Lines 169-182 (bracket-counting loop)\n- **Related Pattern**: `named_group_matcher = re.compile(r'\\(\\?P(<\\w+>)')` (line 149)\n\n### 2. Problem Analysis - FULLY RESOLVED\n**Reported Issue**:\n- Input pattern: `r'entries/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/relationships/(?P<related_field>\\w+)'`\n- The \"related_field\" group doesn't get properly replaced\n- Workaround: adding a trailing '/' fixes the issue\n- Affects Django REST Framework functionality\n\n### 3.

The loop exits without ever finding `unmatched_open_brackets == 0`\n6. Therefore, the final group never gets added to `group_pattern_and_name`\n7.

The problem is indeed in the `replace_named_groups()` function, and the issue is exactly what I identified: when a named group appears at the very end of a pattern (without a trailing '/'), the bracket-counting algorithm fails to properly close the group and add it to the replacement list.\n\nThe bug location I identified (lines 169-182) is correct. The algorithm starts with `unmatched_open_brackets = 1` and looks for characters after the named group to find the closing bracket. When there's no trailing character, the loop never finds the condition where `unmatched_open_brackets == 0`, so the final group never gets processed.\n\nLet me now provide the repair suggestions.\n\nS\n\n1. **Bug location [lines 169-182]**: Add logic after the bracket-counting loop to handle the case where we reach the end of the pattern while still inside a named group. Specifically, after line 182, add a check: if we've exited the loop without finding balanced brackets (i.e., `unmatched_open_brackets > 0`), then we've reached the end of the pattern and should include the remaining pattern from `start` to the end as the complete group pattern. This ensures that final named groups without trailing characters get properly captured and added to `group_pattern_and_name` for replacement.\n\nThe fix should be:\n```python\n# After line 182, add:\nelse:\n    # If we've reached the end of the pattern while still inside a named group,\n    # include the remaining pattern as the complete group pattern\n    if unmatched_open_brackets > 0:\n        group_pattern_and_name.append((pattern[start:], group_name))\n```\n\nThis handles the case where patterns like `r'entries/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/relationships/(?P<related_field>\\w+)'` have their final named group `(?P<related_field>\\w+)` properly captured and replaced, since there are no characters after the closing bracket to process in the loop.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nsimplify_regexp() doesn't replace trailing groups.\nDescription\n\t\nreplace_named_groups() fails to replace the final named group if the urlpattern passed in is missing a trailing '/'.\nFor example, with input r'entries/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/relationships/(?P<related_field>\\w+)' the \"related_field\" does not get properly replaced.

The algorithm starts with `unmatched_open_brackets = 1` and looks for characters after the named group to find the closing bracket.

Specifically, after line 182, add a check: if we've exited the loop without finding balanced brackets (i.e., `unmatched_open_brackets > 0`), then we've reached the end of the pattern and should include the remaining pattern from `start` to the end as the complete group pattern. This ensures that final named groups without trailing characters get properly captured and added to `group_pattern_and_name` for replacement.\n\nThe fix should be:\n```python\n# After line 182, add:\nelse:\n    # If we've reached the end of the pattern while still inside a named group,\n    # include the remaining pattern as the complete group pattern\n    if unmatched_open_brackets > 0:\n        group_pattern_and_name.append((pattern[start:], group_name))\n```\n\nThis handles the case where patterns like `r'entries/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/relationships/(?P<related_field>\\w+)'` have their final named group `(?P<related_field>\\w+)` properly captured and replaced, since there are no characters after the closing bracket to process in the loop.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

E.g.,\n\nSuggestions from analysis:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context. The problem is indeed in the `replace_named_groups()` function, and the issue is exactly what I identified: when a named group appears at the very end of a pattern (without a trailing '/'), the bracket-counting algorithm fails to properly close the group and add it to the replacement list.\n\nThe bug location I identified (lines 169-182) is correct. The algorithm starts with `unmatched_open_brackets = 1` and looks for characters after the named group to find the closing bracket. When there's no trailing character, the loop never finds the condition where `unmatched_open_brackets == 0`, so the final group never gets processed.\n\nLet me now provide the repair suggestions.\n\nS\n\n1. **Bug location [lines 169-182]**: Add logic after the bracket-counting loop to handle the case where we reach the end of the pattern while still inside a named group. Specifically, after line 182, add a check: if we've exited the loop without finding balanced brackets (i.e., `unmatched_open_brackets > 0`), then we've reached the end of the pattern and should include the remaining pattern from `start` to the end as the complete group pattern. This ensures that final named groups without trailing characters get properly captured and added to `group_pattern_and_name` for replacement.\n\nThe fix should be:\n```python\n# After line 182, add:\nelse:\n    # If we've reached the end of the pattern while still inside a named group,\n    # include the remaining pattern as the complete group pattern\n    if unmatched_open_brackets > 0:\n        group_pattern_and_name.append((pattern[start:], group_name))\n```\n\nThis handles the case where patterns like `r'entries/(?P<pk>[^/.]+)/relationships/(?P<related_field>\\w+)'` have their final named group `(?P<related_field>\\w+)` properly captured and replaced, since there are no characters after the closing bracket to process in the loop.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",
