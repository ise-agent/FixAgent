I'm working on [tensorpack](github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack)\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n- I have `napoleon_include_init_with_doc = True`, so `__init__` will be documented. But if I decorate the `__init__` method, it will not show up in docs.\r\nI decorate it with `functools.wraps`, so the decorated object still has the same `__doc__`.\r\nI've found that the bug is due to this commit: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/commit/bbfd0d058aecf85bd3b711a846c83e2fe00fa136\r\nI've printed the relevant variables in that function:\r\n```\r\nqualname='DistributedTrainerReplicated.__init__'\r\nname='__init__'\r\nobj.__doc__ has contents\r\n```\r\nAnd the root cause of the issue is in this line of code:\r\n```python\r\ncls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\r\n```\r\nBecause `obj` now is not the method itself, but a decorated method, its `__globals__` does not contain the class anymore. This makes sphinx think it's not a method, i.e. `cls_is_owner=False`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment info\r\n- OS: <Unix/Linux/Mac/Win/other with version>: ArchLinux\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- Sphinx version:1.6.5\r\n\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list. It must follow the following structure:  example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/viewcode.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 181,\n            \"end_line\": 276\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/viewcode.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 160,\n            \"end_line\": 178\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n                ",

The fix should modify the exception handling (lines 442-443) to use the same importlib-based fallback approach that's already implemented for nested classes (lines 434-439). This will ensure that when the direct `__globals__` lookup fails, the code falls back to using `importlib.import_module` and `functools.reduce` to properly locate the class, making `cls_is_owner` evaluate correctly for decorated `__init__` methods.",

The issue is in the `_skip_member` function in `/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py`\n2. The problematic line is at line 441: `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]`\n3. When `__init__` methods are decorated with `functools.wraps`, the decorated function's `__globals__` doesn't contain the class anymore\n4. This causes `cls_is_owner` to be False, making Sphinx skip the decorated `__init__` method from documentation\n5. The function determines whether to include private/special members (like `__init__`) in documentation based on configuration settings\n\nThe bug occurs because:\n- For undecorated methods: `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` successfully finds the class\n- For decorated methods: `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails because the decorator's globals don't contain the original class\n\nI need to understand the fallback mechanism better. Let me check if there's already a fallback path that uses `importlib` and `functools.reduce` for the case when there are dots in `cls_path`.\n\nThe fix should ensure that when `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails (line 441), we fall back to the same approach used for nested classes (lines 437-439).\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is located at:\n- **Line 441**: `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]` - This line fails for decorated methods because their `__globals__` doesn't contain the class\n- **Lines 442-443**: The exception handling that sets `cls_is_owner = False` when the lookup fails\n- **Lines 445-446**: The logic that determines `cls_is_owner` based on whether the class was found\n- **Line 450**: The condition `what == 'module' or cls_is_owner` that determines if the member should be included\n- **Lines 451-462**: The logic that checks if `__init__` methods should be included based on configuration\n\nThe fix should modify the exception handling to use the same importlib-based approach that's already implemented for nested classes (lines 434-439) as a fallback when the direct `__globals__` lookup fails.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug, I've identified the root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed. The issue is in the `_skip_member` function where decorated `__init__` methods fail the class ownership check because their `__globals__` doesn't contain the original class.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 440,\n            \"end_line\": 446\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe bug is specifically at line 441 where `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails for decorated methods. The fix should modify the exception handling (lines 442-443) to use the same importlib-based fallback approach that's already implemented for nested classes (lines 434-439). This will ensure that when the direct `__globals__` lookup fails, the code falls back to using `importlib.import_module` and `functools.reduce` to properly locate the class, making `cls_is_owner` evaluate correctly for decorated `__init__` methods.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nDecorated __init__ doesn't show up in docs\nSubject: Decorated __init__ won't be documented. I'm working on [tensorpack](github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack)\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n- I have `napoleon_include_init_with_doc = True`, so `__init__` will be documented. But if I decorate the `__init__` method, it will not show up in docs.\r\nI decorate it with `functools.wraps`, so the decorated object still has the same `__doc__`.\r\nI've found that the bug is due to this commit: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/commit/bbfd0d058aecf85bd3b711a846c83e2fe00fa136\r\nI've printed the relevant variables in that function:\r\n```\r\nqualname='DistributedTrainerReplicated.__init__'\r\nname='__init__'\r\nobj.__doc__ has contents\r\n```\r\nAnd the root cause of the issue is in this line of code:\r\n```python\r\ncls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\r\n```\r\nBecause `obj` now is not the method itself, but a decorated method, its `__globals__` does not contain the class anymore. This makes sphinx think it's not a method, i.e. `cls_is_owner=False`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment info\r\n- OS: <Unix/Linux/Mac/Win/other with version>: ArchLinux\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- Sphinx version:1.6.5\r\n\n",

The issue is in the `_skip_member` function in `/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py`\n2. The problematic line is at line 441: `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]`\n3. When `__init__` methods are decorated with `functools.wraps`, the decorated function's `__globals__` doesn't contain the class anymore\n4. This causes `cls_is_owner` to be False, making Sphinx skip the decorated `__init__` method from documentation\n5. The function determines whether to include private/special members (like `__init__`) in documentation based on configuration settings\n\nThe bug occurs because:\n- For undecorated methods: `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` successfully finds the class\n- For decorated methods: `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails because the decorator's globals don't contain the original class\n\nI need to understand the fallback mechanism better. Let me check if there's already a fallback path that uses `importlib` and `functools.reduce` for the case when there are dots in `cls_path`.\n\nThe fix should ensure that when `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails (line 441), we fall back to the same approach used for nested classes (lines 437-439).\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is located at:\n- **Line 441**: `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]` - This line fails for decorated methods because their `__globals__` doesn't contain the class\n- **Lines 442-443**: The exception handling that sets `cls_is_owner = False` when the lookup fails\n- **Lines 445-446**: The logic that determines `cls_is_owner` based on whether the class was found\n- **Line 450**: The condition `what == 'module' or cls_is_owner` that determines if the member should be included\n- **Lines 451-462**: The logic that checks if `__init__` methods should be included based on configuration\n\nThe fix should modify the exception handling to use the same importlib-based approach that's already implemented for nested classes (lines 434-439) as a fallback when the direct `__globals__` lookup fails.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug, I've identified the root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed. The issue is in the `_skip_member` function where decorated `__init__` methods fail the class ownership check because their `__globals__` doesn't contain the original class.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 440,\n            \"end_line\": 446\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe bug is specifically at line 441 where `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails for decorated methods. The fix should modify the exception handling (lines 442-443) to use the same importlib-based fallback approach that's already implemented for nested classes (lines 434-439). This will ensure that when the direct `__globals__` lookup fails, the code falls back to using `importlib.import_module` and `functools.reduce` to properly locate the class, making `cls_is_owner` evaluate correctly for decorated `__init__` methods.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context. The user has clearly identified the bug:\n\n1. **Problem**: Decorated `__init__` methods don't show up in documentation even with `napoleon_include_init_with_doc = True`\n2. **Root cause**: When `__init__` is decorated with `functools.wraps`, the decorated function's `__globals__` doesn't contain the original class\n3. **Specific issue**: Line 441 `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails because the decorator's globals don't have the class\n4. **Result**: `cls_is_owner` becomes False, causing Sphinx to skip the decorated `__init__` method\n\nThe user has already identified the exact problematic line and the mechanism. The fix needs to handle the case where `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails by using an alternative method to find the class.\n\nLooking at the existing code, there's already a fallback mechanism for nested classes (lines 434-439) that uses `importlib.import_module` and `functools.reduce`. The fix should extend this approach to handle the case where the direct `__globals__` lookup fails.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Lines 440-446**: Modify the exception handling to use the importlib-based fallback approach when `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails. Instead of immediately setting `cls_is_owner = False` in the exception handler, try the same importlib approach used for nested classes (lines 434-439) as a fallback. This ensures that decorated methods can still find their owning class through module introspection rather than relying on the decorator's limited `__globals__`.\n\nThe fix should change the logic from:\n```python\nelse:\n    cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\n```\nto use the same importlib-based approach as the nested class case, ensuring that when direct `__globals__` lookup fails (as it does for decorated methods), the code falls back to importing the module and using `functools.reduce` to traverse the class hierarchy and find the correct class owner.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py lines 440-446\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    else:\n                        cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\n                except Exception:\n                    cls_is_owner = False\n                else:\n                    cls_is_owner = (cls and hasattr(cls, name) and  # type: ignore\n                                    name in cls.__dict__)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nDecorated __init__ doesn't show up in docs\nSubject: Decorated __init__ won't be documented. I'm working on [tensorpack](github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack)\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n- I have `napoleon_include_init_with_doc = True`, so `__init__` will be documented. But if I decorate the `__init__` method, it will not show up in docs.\r\nI decorate it with `functools.wraps`, so the decorated object still has the same `__doc__`.\r\nI've found that the bug is due to this commit: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/commit/bbfd0d058aecf85bd3b711a846c83e2fe00fa136\r\nI've printed the relevant variables in that function:\r\n```\r\nqualname='DistributedTrainerReplicated.__init__'\r\nname='__init__'\r\nobj.__doc__ has contents\r\n```\r\nAnd the root cause of the issue is in this line of code:\r\n```python\r\ncls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\r\n```\r\nBecause `obj` now is not the method itself, but a decorated method, its `__globals__` does not contain the class anymore. This makes sphinx think it's not a method, i.e. `cls_is_owner=False`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment info\r\n- OS: <Unix/Linux/Mac/Win/other with version>: ArchLinux\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- Sphinx version:1.6.5\r\n\n",

The issue is in the `_skip_member` function in `/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py`\n2. The problematic line is at line 441: `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]`\n3. When `__init__` methods are decorated with `functools.wraps`, the decorated function's `__globals__` doesn't contain the class anymore\n4. This causes `cls_is_owner` to be False, making Sphinx skip the decorated `__init__` method from documentation\n5. The function determines whether to include private/special members (like `__init__`) in documentation based on configuration settings\n\nThe bug occurs because:\n- For undecorated methods: `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` successfully finds the class\n- For decorated methods: `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails because the decorator's globals don't contain the original class\n\nI need to understand the fallback mechanism better. Let me check if there's already a fallback path that uses `importlib` and `functools.reduce` for the case when there are dots in `cls_path`.\n\nThe fix should ensure that when `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails (line 441), we fall back to the same approach used for nested classes (lines 437-439).\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is located at:\n- **Line 441**: `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]` - This line fails for decorated methods because their `__globals__` doesn't contain the class\n- **Lines 442-443**: The exception handling that sets `cls_is_owner = False` when the lookup fails\n- **Lines 445-446**: The logic that determines `cls_is_owner` based on whether the class was found\n- **Line 450**: The condition `what == 'module' or cls_is_owner` that determines if the member should be included\n- **Lines 451-462**: The logic that checks if `__init__` methods should be included based on configuration\n\nThe fix should modify the exception handling to use the same importlib-based approach that's already implemented for nested classes (lines 434-439) as a fallback when the direct `__globals__` lookup fails.\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug, I've identified the root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed. The issue is in the `_skip_member` function where decorated `__init__` methods fail the class ownership check because their `__globals__` doesn't contain the original class.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 440,\n            \"end_line\": 446\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe bug is specifically at line 441 where `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails for decorated methods. The fix should modify the exception handling (lines 442-443) to use the same importlib-based fallback approach that's already implemented for nested classes (lines 434-439). This will ensure that when the direct `__globals__` lookup fails, the code falls back to using `importlib.import_module` and `functools.reduce` to properly locate the class, making `cls_is_owner` evaluate correctly for decorated `__init__` methods.\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context. The user has clearly identified the bug:\n\n1. **Problem**: Decorated `__init__` methods don't show up in documentation even with `napoleon_include_init_with_doc = True`\n2. **Root cause**: When `__init__` is decorated with `functools.wraps`, the decorated function's `__globals__` doesn't contain the original class\n3. **Specific issue**: Line 441 `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails because the decorator's globals don't have the class\n4. **Result**: `cls_is_owner` becomes False, causing Sphinx to skip the decorated `__init__` method\n\nThe user has already identified the exact problematic line and the mechanism. The fix needs to handle the case where `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails by using an alternative method to find the class.\n\nLooking at the existing code, there's already a fallback mechanism for nested classes (lines 434-439) that uses `importlib.import_module` and `functools.reduce`. The fix should extend this approach to handle the case where the direct `__globals__` lookup fails.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Lines 440-446**: Modify the exception handling to use the importlib-based fallback approach when `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails. Instead of immediately setting `cls_is_owner = False` in the exception handler, try the same importlib approach used for nested classes (lines 434-439) as a fallback. This ensures that decorated methods can still find their owning class through module introspection rather than relying on the decorator's limited `__globals__`.\n\nThe fix should change the logic from:\n```python\nelse:\n    cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\n```\nto use the same importlib-based approach as the nested class case, ensuring that when direct `__globals__` lookup fails (as it does for decorated methods), the code falls back to importing the module and using `functools.reduce` to traverse the class hierarchy and find the correct class owner.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py lines 440-446\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    else:\n                        cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\n                except Exception:\n                    cls_is_owner = False\n                else:\n                    cls_is_owner = (cls and hasattr(cls, name) and  # type: ignore\n                                    name in cls.__dict__)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\nAssistant: **CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, these locations are ready for fixing.

    "response": "# Summary of Bug Investigation and Fix for Sphinx Napoleon Extension\n\n## Main Objectives and Tasks\nThe primary objective was to identify and fix a bug in the Sphinx Napoleon extension where decorated `__init__` methods were not appearing in documentation, even when `napoleon_include_init_with_doc = True` was configured.\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects/sphinx`\n- **Result**: Identified the Sphinx project structure with key directories including `sphinx/` containing the source code\n\n### 2.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Summary of Bug Investigation and Fix for Sphinx Napoleon Extension\n\n## Main Objectives and Tasks\nThe primary objective was to identify and fix a bug in the Sphinx Napoleon extension where decorated `__init__` methods were not appearing in documentation, even when `napoleon_include_init_with_doc = True` was configured.\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects/sphinx`\n- **Result**: Identified the Sphinx project structure with key directories including `sphinx/` containing the source code\n\n### 2. Code Location Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` to find the problematic line `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]`\n- **Result**: Located the exact bug at line 441 in `/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py`\n\n### 3. Context Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: Multiple `read_file_lines` calls to understand the complete function context\n- **Result**: Analyzed the `_skip_member` function (lines 381-463) which determines whether class members should be included in documentation\n\n## Technical Details and Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Bug Location\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py`\n- **Function**: `_skip_member` (lines 381-463)\n- **Problematic Lines**: 440-446\n\n### Root Cause\n1. **Issue**: When `__init__` methods are decorated with `functools.wraps`, the decorated function's `__globals__` dictionary doesn't contain the original class\n2. **Failure Point**: Line 441 `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails because the decorator's globals don't have access to the class\n3. **Consequence**: The exception handler sets `cls_is_owner = False`, causing Sphinx to skip the decorated `__init__` method from documentation\n\n### Existing Fallback Mechanism\nThe code already has a robust fallback mechanism for nested classes (lines 434-439):\n```python\nif '.' in cls_path:\n    mod = importlib.import_module(obj.__module__)\n    mod_path = cls_path.split('.')\n    cls = functools.reduce(getattr, mod_path, mod)\n```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Bug location identified and confirmed\n- Root cause analysis completed\n- Existing fallback mechanism analyzed\n- Fix strategy determined\n\n### 🔄 Ready for Implementation\nThe fix is ready to be implemented. The solution involves modifying the exception handling in lines 442-443 to use the same importlib-based approach as a fallback when the direct `__globals__` lookup fails.\n\n## Proposed Fix Strategy\n\n**Location**: Lines 440-446 in `/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py`\n\n**Approach**: Instead of immediately setting `cls_is_owner = False` when `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails, implement a fallback that uses:\n1. `importlib.import_module(obj.__module__)` to get the module\n2. `functools.reduce(getattr, cls_path.split('.'), mod)` to traverse and find the class\n\nThis ensures decorated methods can still find their owning class through module introspection rather than relying on the decorator's limited `__globals__`.\n\n## Important Technical Considerations\n- The fix leverages existing imports (`importlib` and `functools`) already available in the file\n- The solution maintains backward compatibility\n- The approach mirrors the existing pattern used for nested classes\n- Proper exception handling ensures graceful fallback behavior\n\n## Next Steps\nThe code is ready for patch implementation. The fix will modify the exception handling block to include the importlib-based fallback mechanism, ensuring decorated `__init__` methods are properly recognized as class members and included in documentation when configured to do so.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py\nStart line: 440\nEnd line: 446\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context.

The fix needs to handle the case where `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails by using an alternative method to find the class.\n\nLooking at the existing code, there's already a fallback mechanism for nested classes (lines 434-439) that uses `importlib.import_module` and `functools.reduce`. The fix should extend this approach to handle the case where the direct `__globals__` lookup fails.\n\nS\n\n1. **Lines 440-446**: Modify the exception handling to use the importlib-based fallback approach when `obj.__globals__[cls_path]` fails.

This ensures that decorated methods can still find their owning class through module introspection rather than relying on the decorator's limited `__globals__`.\n\nThe fix should change the logic from:\n```python\nelse:\n    cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]\n```\nto use the same importlib-based approach as the nested class case, ensuring that when direct `__globals__` lookup fails (as it does for decorated methods), the code falls back to importing the module and using `functools.reduce` to traverse the class hierarchy and find the correct class owner.\nNote that the Patch provided should be a direct substitution of the location code by the Locator.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context.
