I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n",

I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n",

I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: Located the pytest project structure and identified `/root/hy/projects_3/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` as the relevant file containing temporary directory logic.\n\n### 2. Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found the `TempPathFactory` class responsible for creating temporary directories\n  - Located the `getbasetemp()` method (lines 102-125) where the issue occurs\n  - Identified the problematic code at lines 114 and 117:\n    ```python\n    user = get_user() or \"unknown\"\n    rootdir = temproot.joinpath(f\"pytest-of-{user}\")\n    ```\n  - Found the `get_user()` function (lines 151-159) that directly returns `getpass.getuser()` without sanitization\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug occurs because:\n1. `get_user()` calls `getpass.getuser()` which can return usernames with illegal directory characters (like backslashes in domain usernames)\n2. This username is directly used in `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` to create directory paths\n3. When the path contains illegal characters, directory creation fails\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Identified**: Located the exact source of the bug\n- ✅ **Analyzed**: Understood the flow from `get_user()` → `getbasetemp()` → directory creation\n- 🔄 **Next Step**: Implement sanitization logic in the `get_user()` function or in the directory path creation\n\n## Technical Details\n- **File to Modify**: `/root/hy/projects_3/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py`\n- **Function to Fix**: `get_user()` (lines 151-159)\n- **Issue Location**: Line 117 in `getbasetemp()` method where unsanitized username is used\n- **Required Fix**: Add character sanitization to replace illegal directory name characters with safe alternatives\n\n## Recommended Solution\nModify the `get_user()` function to sanitize the username by replacing illegal characters (like backslashes, colons, etc.) with safe alternatives (like underscores or hyphens) before returning the username for directory creation.\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: For project structure navigation\n- `read_file_lines`: For detailed code examination\n- `search_code_with_context`: For locating specific functions\n\nThe investigation is complete and ready for implementation of the fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nStart line: 151\nEnd line: 159\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nStart line: 114\nEnd line: 117\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context!

I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n",

This is where usernames like `contoso\\john_doe` are returned with illegal directory characters (backslashes).\n\n**Location 2 (lines 114-117)**: The unsanitized username is used directly in `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` to create the directory path, which fails when the username contains illegal characters.\n\nThe problem is clear from the error message showing the path `C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe` - the backslash in `contoso\\john_doe` creates an invalid directory structure.\n\nThe fix is straightforward: sanitize the username in the `get_user()` function by replacing illegal directory characters (like backslashes, colons, etc.) with safe alternatives like underscores or hyphens.\n\nBoth locations are clearly identified and ready for fixing. Location 1 needs the sanitization logic added, and Location 2 will automatically work correctly once Location 1 is fixed.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_3/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py lines 151-159\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import os\n  import re\n  import tempfile\n  from pathlib import Path\n  from typing import Optional\n  import attr\n  import py\n  from .pathlib import ensure_reset_dir\n  from .pathlib import LOCK_TIMEOUT\n  from .pathlib import make_numbered_dir\n  from .pathlib import make_numbered_dir_with_cleanup\n  from _pytest.compat import final\n  from _pytest.config import Config\n  from _pytest.deprecated import check_ispytest\n  from _pytest.fixtures import fixture\n  from _pytest.fixtures import FixtureRequest\n  from _pytest.monkeypatch import MonkeyPatch\n  import getpass\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  141: \n[C]  142:     def mktemp(self, basename: str, numbered: bool = True) -> py.path.local:\n[C]  143:         \"\"\"Same as :meth:`TempPathFactory.mktemp`, but returns a ``py.path.local`` object.\"\"\"\n[C]  144:         return py.path.local(self._tmppath_factory.mktemp(basename, numbered).resolve())\n[C]  145: \n[C]  146:     def getbasetemp(self) -> py.path.local:\n[C]  147:         \"\"\"Backward compat wrapper for ``_tmppath_factory.getbasetemp``.\"\"\"\n[C]  148:         return py.path.local(self._tmppath_factory.getbasetemp().resolve())\n[C]  149: \n[C]  150: \n[R]  151: def get_user() -> Optional[str]:\n[R]  152:     \"\"\"Return the current user name, or None if getuser() does not work\n[R]  153:     in the current environment (see #1010).\"\"\"\n[R]  154:     import getpass\n[R]  155: \n[R]  156:     try:\n[R]  157:         return getpass.getuser()\n[R]  158:     except (ImportError, KeyError):\n[R]  159:         return None\n[C]  160: \n[C]  161: \n[C]  162: def pytest_configure(config: Config) -> None:\n[C]  163:     \"\"\"Create a TempdirFactory and attach it to the config object.\n[C]  164: \n[C]  165:     This is to comply with existing plugins which expect the handler to be\n[C]  166:     available at pytest_configure time, but ideally should be moved entirely\n[C]  167:     to the tmpdir_factory session fixture.\n[C]  168:     \"\"\"\n[C]  169:     mp = MonkeyPatch()\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_3/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py lines 114-117\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import os\n  import re\n  import tempfile\n  from pathlib import Path\n  from typing import Optional\n  import attr\n  import py\n  from .pathlib import ensure_reset_dir\n  from .pathlib import LOCK_TIMEOUT\n  from .pathlib import make_numbered_dir\n  from .pathlib import make_numbered_dir_with_cleanup\n  from _pytest.compat import final\n  from _pytest.config import Config\n  from _pytest.deprecated import check_ispytest\n  from _pytest.fixtures import fixture\n  from _pytest.fixtures import FixtureRequest\n  from _pytest.monkeypatch import MonkeyPatch\n  import getpass\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  104:         if self._basetemp is not None:\n[C]  105:             return self._basetemp\n[C]  106: \n[C]  107:         if self._given_basetemp is not None:\n[C]  108:             basetemp = self._given_basetemp\n[C]  109:             ensure_reset_dir(basetemp)\n[C]  110:             basetemp = basetemp.resolve()\n[C]  111:         else:\n[C]  112:             from_env = os.environ.get(\"PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT\")\n[C]  113:             temproot = Path(from_env or tempfile.gettempdir()).resolve()\n[R]  114:             user = get_user() or \"unknown\"\n[R]  115:             #
