In `keyfunc3` (lines 158-174), all non-alphabetic characters are grouped under the same \"Symbols\" heading.\n\n3. The `groupby` function on line 176 groups consecutive items with the same key, but because some symbols get sorted to the beginning (without chr(127) prefix) and others get sorted to the end (with chr(127) prefix), they end up in separate groups even though they all return the same \"Symbols\" key.\n\nLet me examine the complete `keyfunc2` function to understand the full sorting logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 140, \"end_line\": 160 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 140-160:\n\n 140:                             del newlist[i]\n 141:                             continue\n 142:                         oldkey = m.group(1)\n 143:                     else:\n 144:                         oldkey = key\n 145:                 oldsubitems = subitems\n 146:                 i += 1\n 147: \n 148:         # sort the sub-index entries\n 149:         def keyfunc2(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n 150:             key = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', entry[0].lower())\n 151:             if key.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 152:                 key = key[1:]\n 153:             if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n 154:                 key = chr(127) + key\n 155:             return key\n 156: \n 157:         # group the entries by letter\n 158:         def keyfunc3(item: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n 159:             # hack: mutating the subitems dicts to a list in the keyfunc\n 160:             k, v = item\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug! The issue is in the sorting logic in `keyfunc2`. Let me analyze what's happening:\n\n1. In `keyfunc2` (lines 149-155), the logic adds `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters and underscores to sort them later\n2. However, this creates inconsistent sorting for symbols:\n   - Some symbols (like `@`) don't get the `chr(127)` prefix, so they sort early\n   - Other symbols that might start with alphabetic-looking characters or underscores get the `chr(127)` prefix and sort late\n3. When `keyfunc3` groups them, both groups return \"Symbols\" but they're not consecutive due to the sorting inconsistency\n\nLet me look at the broader context of the `create_index` method to understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 90, \"end_line\": 120 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 90-120:\n\n  90: \n  91:         # sort the index entries for same keyword.\n  92:         def keyfunc0(entry: Tuple[str, str]) -> Tuple[bool, str]:\n  93:             main, uri = entry\n  94:             return (not main, uri)  # show main entries at first\n  95: \n  96:         for indexentry in new.values():\n  97:             indexentry[0].sort(key=keyfunc0)\n  98:             for subentry in indexentry[1].values():\n  99:                 subentry[0].sort(key=keyfunc0)  # type: ignore\n 100: \n 101:         # sort the index entries; put all symbols at the front, even those\n 102:         # following the letters in ASCII, this is where the chr(127) comes from\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n 116:         newlist = sorted(new.items(), key=keyfunc)\n 117: \n 118:         if group_entries:\n 119:             # fixup entries: transform\n 120:             #   func() (in module foo)\n\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete picture. Looking at the code, I can see there are actually TWO sorting functions that both use the same flawed logic:\n\n1. `keyfunc` (lines 103-115) - used for the main sorting at line 116\n2. `keyfunc2` (lines 149-155) - used for sorting sub-entries at line 162\n\nBoth functions have the same bug: they add `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters and underscores, but this creates inconsistent sorting for symbols. The comment at line 101-102 even mentions \"put all symbols at the front\" but the logic is backwards!\n\nThe issue is that `chr(127)` has a high ASCII value, so adding it as a prefix actually puts items at the END, not the front. This means:\n- Symbols like `@` (without chr(127) prefix) sort early \n- Alphabetic entries (with chr(127) prefix) sort late\n- Some symbols that might be processed differently also end up late\n\nWhen `keyfunc3` groups them, both symbol groups return \"Symbols\" but they're separated by the alphabetic entries in between.\n\nLet me look at the exact locations where the fix needs to be applied.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 101, \"end_line\": 116 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 101-116:\n\n 101:         # sort the index entries; put all symbols at the front, even those\n 102:         # following the letters in ASCII, this is where the chr(127) comes from\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n 116:         newlist = sorted(new.items(), key=keyfunc)\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1. What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nTwo sections called Symbols in index\nWhen using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries after the ”normal” words.  Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n",

The issue is in the sorting logic that's supposed to put symbols at the front but actually creates two separate symbol groups. Let me identify the exact locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe bug manifests in two identical pieces of flawed logic:\n\n1. **Primary sorting function `keyfunc`** (lines 111-112): Adds `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters, but this puts them at the END, not the front as intended by the comment.\n\n2. **Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`** (lines 153-154): Has the exact same flawed logic.\n\nThe result is that symbols get split into two groups:\n- Early symbols (like `@`) that don't get the chr(127) prefix\n- Late symbols (like `£`, `←`) that somehow get processed differently and end up after alphabetic entries\n\nBoth groups return \"Symbols\" in `keyfunc3` but they're not consecutive, so `groupby()` creates duplicate sections.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n\n**Location 1: Lines 111-112** - Primary sorting logic in `keyfunc` function\n- **Issue**: Incorrect use of `chr(127)` prefix that puts alphabetic entries at the end instead of symbols at the front\n- **Fix needed**: Reverse the logic to put symbols at the front consistently\n\n**Location 2: Lines 153-154** - Sub-entry sorting logic in `keyfunc2` function  \n- **Issue**: Same incorrect logic as Location 1, creating inconsistent symbol sorting in sub-entries\n- **Fix needed**: Apply the same fix as Location 1 to maintain consistency\n\n**Location 3: Lines 167-172** - Grouping logic in `keyfunc3` function\n- **Issue**: Depends on consecutive ordering from sorting, but sorting is inconsistent\n- **Context**: This logic is correct but fails due to the sorting bugs above\n\n**Location 4: Lines 101-102** - Comment describing intended behavior\n- **Issue**: Comment correctly states intention to \"put all symbols at the front\" but implementation does the opposite\n- **Fix needed**: Update comment to match corrected implementation\n\n**Location 5: Line 176** - Final groupby operation\n- **Issue**: Groups consecutive items with same key, but symbols are not consecutive due to sorting bugs\n- **Context**: This line is correct but produces duplicate \"Symbols\" sections due to upstream sorting issues\n\nThe core fix is to reverse the sorting logic in both `keyfunc` and `keyfunc2` functions so that symbols consistently sort before alphabetic characters, ensuring all symbols are grouped together under a single \"Symbols\" section.",

The `groupby` function on line 176 groups consecutive items with the same key, but because some symbols get sorted to the beginning (without chr(127) prefix) and others get sorted to the end (with chr(127) prefix), they end up in separate groups even though they all return the same \"Symbols\" key.\n\nLet me examine the complete `keyfunc2` function to understand the full sorting logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 140, \"end_line\": 160 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 140-160:\n\n 140:                             del newlist[i]\n 141:                             continue\n 142:                         oldkey = m.group(1)\n 143:                     else:\n 144:                         oldkey = key\n 145:                 oldsubitems = subitems\n 146:                 i += 1\n 147: \n 148:         # sort the sub-index entries\n 149:         def keyfunc2(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n 150:             key = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', entry[0].lower())\n 151:             if key.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 152:                 key = key[1:]\n 153:             if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n 154:                 key = chr(127) + key\n 155:             return key\n 156: \n 157:         # group the entries by letter\n 158:         def keyfunc3(item: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n 159:             # hack: mutating the subitems dicts to a list in the keyfunc\n 160:             k, v = item\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug! The issue is in the sorting logic in `keyfunc2`. Let me analyze what's happening:\n\n1. In `keyfunc2` (lines 149-155), the logic adds `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters and underscores to sort them later\n2. However, this creates inconsistent sorting for symbols:\n   - Some symbols (like `@`) don't get the `chr(127)` prefix, so they sort early\n   - Other symbols that might start with alphabetic-looking characters or underscores get the `chr(127)` prefix and sort late\n3. When `keyfunc3` groups them, both groups return \"Symbols\" but they're not consecutive due to the sorting inconsistency\n\nLet me look at the broader context of the `create_index` method to understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 90, \"end_line\": 120 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 90-120:\n\n  90: \n  91:         # sort the index entries for same keyword.\n  92:         def keyfunc0(entry: Tuple[str, str]) -> Tuple[bool, str]:\n  93:             main, uri = entry\n  94:             return (not main, uri)  # show main entries at first\n  95: \n  96:         for indexentry in new.values():\n  97:             indexentry[0].sort(key=keyfunc0)\n  98:             for subentry in indexentry[1].values():\n  99:                 subentry[0].sort(key=keyfunc0)  # type: ignore\n 100: \n 101:         # sort the index entries; put all symbols at the front, even those\n 102:         # following the letters in ASCII, this is where the chr(127) comes from\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n 116:         newlist = sorted(new.items(), key=keyfunc)\n 117: \n 118:         if group_entries:\n 119:             # fixup entries: transform\n 120:             #   func() (in module foo)\n\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete picture. Looking at the code, I can see there are actually TWO sorting functions that both use the same flawed logic:\n\n1. `keyfunc` (lines 103-115) - used for the main sorting at line 116\n2. `keyfunc2` (lines 149-155) - used for sorting sub-entries at line 162\n\nBoth functions have the same bug: they add `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters and underscores, but this creates inconsistent sorting for symbols. The comment at line 101-102 even mentions \"put all symbols at the front\" but the logic is backwards!\n\nThe issue is that `chr(127)` has a high ASCII value, so adding it as a prefix actually puts items at the END, not the front. This means:\n- Symbols like `@` (without chr(127) prefix) sort early \n- Alphabetic entries (with chr(127) prefix) sort late\n- Some symbols that might be processed differently also end up late\n\nWhen `keyfunc3` groups them, both symbol groups return \"Symbols\" but they're separated by the alphabetic entries in between.\n\nLet me look at the exact locations where the fix needs to be applied.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 101, \"end_line\": 116 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 101-116:\n\n 101:         # sort the index entries; put all symbols at the front, even those\n 102:         # following the letters in ASCII, this is where the chr(127) comes from\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n 116:         newlist = sorted(new.items(), key=keyfunc)\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug! The issue is in the sorting logic that's supposed to put symbols at the front but actually creates two separate symbol groups. Let me identify the exact locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe bug manifests in two identical pieces of flawed logic:\n\n1. **Primary sorting function `keyfunc`** (lines 111-112): Adds `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters, but this puts them at the END, not the front as intended by the comment.\n\n2. **Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`** (lines 153-154): Has the exact same flawed logic.\n\nThe result is that symbols get split into two groups:\n- Early symbols (like `@`) that don't get the chr(127) prefix\n- Late symbols (like `£`, `←`) that somehow get processed differently and end up after alphabetic entries\n\nBoth groups return \"Symbols\" in `keyfunc3` but they're not consecutive, so `groupby()` creates duplicate sections.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n\n**Location 1: Lines 111-112** - Primary sorting logic in `keyfunc` function\n- **Issue**: Incorrect use of `chr(127)` prefix that puts alphabetic entries at the end instead of symbols at the front\n- **Fix needed**: Reverse the logic to put symbols at the front consistently\n\n**Location 2: Lines 153-154** - Sub-entry sorting logic in `keyfunc2` function  \n- **Issue**: Same incorrect logic as Location 1, creating inconsistent symbol sorting in sub-entries\n- **Fix needed**: Apply the same fix as Location 1 to maintain consistency\n\n**Location 3: Lines 167-172** - Grouping logic in `keyfunc3` function\n- **Issue**: Depends on consecutive ordering from sorting, but sorting is inconsistent\n- **Context**: This logic is correct but fails due to the sorting bugs above\n\n**Location 4: Lines 101-102** - Comment describing intended behavior\n- **Issue**: Comment correctly states intention to \"put all symbols at the front\" but implementation does the opposite\n- **Fix needed**: Update comment to match corrected implementation\n\n**Location 5: Line 176** - Final groupby operation\n- **Issue**: Groups consecutive items with same key, but symbols are not consecutive due to sorting bugs\n- **Context**: This line is correct but produces duplicate \"Symbols\" sections due to upstream sorting issues\n\nThe core fix is to reverse the sorting logic in both `keyfunc` and `keyfunc2` functions so that symbols consistently sort before alphabetic characters, ensuring all symbols are grouped together under a single \"Symbols\" section.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nTwo sections called Symbols in index\nWhen using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries after the ”normal” words.  Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the main Sphinx codebase structure at `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/`\n- **Key Finding**: Identified the builders directory containing HTML-specific code\n\n### 2. Code Search and Location\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"Symbols\"\n- **Result**: Found the critical file `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the exact code responsible for \"Symbols\" categorization at lines 169-175\n\n### 3. Root Cause Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` to examine the IndexEntries class\n- **Result**: Identified the bug in the sorting and grouping logic\n\n## Root Cause Identified\n\nThe bug is in `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` in the `create_index` method:\n\n### Problem Details:\n1. **Inconsistent Sorting Logic** (lines 150-155 in `keyfunc2`):\n   - Alphabetic characters and underscores get `chr(127)` prefix added to sort key\n   - Non-alphabetic symbols don't get this prefix\n   - This creates two different sort positions for symbols\n\n2. **Grouping Logic** (lines 158-174 in `keyfunc3`):\n   - All non-alphabetic characters return the same `_('Symbols')` key\n   - However, `groupby()` only groups consecutive items with the same key\n   - Due to inconsistent sorting, symbols end up in non-consecutive positions\n\n3. **Result**: \n   - Some symbols sort early (without chr(127) prefix)\n   - Some symbols sort late (with chr(127) prefix) \n   - Both groups return \"Symbols\" but are separated, creating duplicate sections\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Key Code Locations:\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Method**: `IndexEntries.create_index()`\n- **Problem Functions**: \n  - `keyfunc2()` (lines 149-155): Inconsistent sort key generation\n  - `keyfunc3()` (lines 158-174): Grouping logic that depends on consecutive ordering\n\n### Current Logic Flow:\n1. Entries are sorted using `keyfunc2` \n2. Entries are grouped by `keyfunc3` using `groupby()`\n3. Non-consecutive \"Symbols\" entries create multiple groups\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n### Immediate Fix Options:\n1. **Option A**: Modify `keyfunc2` to ensure all symbols sort together\n2. **Option B**: Modify the grouping logic to merge all \"Symbols\" groups post-processing\n3. **Option C**: Change the sorting strategy to separate alphabetic vs symbolic sorting entirely\n\n### Recommended Approach:\nFix the sorting inconsistency in `keyfunc2` to ensure all symbols are sorted consecutively, which will allow the existing `groupby()` logic to work correctly.\n\n## Current Status\n- ✅ Bug located and root cause identified\n- ✅ Affected code sections mapped\n- ⏳ **Next**: Implement and test the fix\n- ⏳ **Next**: Verify fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\nThe investigation is complete and ready for implementation of the fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 111\nEnd line: 112\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 153\nEnd line: 154\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 167\nEnd line: 172\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 175\nEnd line: 176\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI can see the issue is in the IndexEntries class.

When `keyfunc3` groups them, both groups return \"Symbols\" but they're not consecutive due to the sorting inconsistency\n\nLet me look at the broader context of the `create_index` method to understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 90, \"end_line\": 120 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 90-120:\n\n  90: \n  91:         # sort the index entries for same keyword.\n  92:         def keyfunc0(entry: Tuple[str, str]) -> Tuple[bool, str]:\n  93:             main, uri = entry\n  94:             return (not main, uri)  # show main entries at first\n  95: \n  96:         for indexentry in new.values():\n  97:             indexentry[0].sort(key=keyfunc0)\n  98:             for subentry in indexentry[1].values():\n  99:                 subentry[0].sort(key=keyfunc0)  # type: ignore\n 100: \n 101:         # sort the index entries; put all symbols at the front, even those\n 102:         # following the letters in ASCII, this is where the chr(127) comes from\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n 116:         newlist = sorted(new.items(), key=keyfunc)\n 117: \n 118:         if group_entries:\n 119:             # fixup entries: transform\n 120:             #   func() (in module foo)\n\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete picture. Looking at the code, I can see there are actually TWO sorting functions that both use the same flawed logic:\n\n1. `keyfunc` (lines 103-115) - used for the main sorting at line 116\n2. `keyfunc2` (lines 149-155) - used for sorting sub-entries at line 162\n\nBoth functions have the same bug: they add `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters and underscores, but this creates inconsistent sorting for symbols. The comment at line 101-102 even mentions \"put all symbols at the front\" but the logic is backwards!\n\nThe issue is that `chr(127)` has a high ASCII value, so adding it as a prefix actually puts items at the END, not the front. This means:\n- Symbols like `@` (without chr(127) prefix) sort early \n- Alphabetic entries (with chr(127) prefix) sort late\n- Some symbols that might be processed differently also end up late\n\nWhen `keyfunc3` groups them, both symbol groups return \"Symbols\" but they're separated by the alphabetic entries in between.\n\nLet me look at the exact locations where the fix needs to be applied.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 101, \"end_line\": 116 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 101-116:\n\n 101:         # sort the index entries; put all symbols at the front, even those\n 102:         # following the letters in ASCII, this is where the chr(127) comes from\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n 116:         newlist = sorted(new.items(), key=keyfunc)\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug! The issue is in the sorting logic that's supposed to put symbols at the front but actually creates two separate symbol groups. Let me identify the exact locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe bug manifests in two identical pieces of flawed logic:\n\n1. **Primary sorting function `keyfunc`** (lines 111-112): Adds `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters, but this puts them at the END, not the front as intended by the comment.\n\n2. **Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`** (lines 153-154): Has the exact same flawed logic.\n\nThe result is that symbols get split into two groups:\n- Early symbols (like `@`) that don't get the chr(127) prefix\n- Late symbols (like `£`, `←`) that somehow get processed differently and end up after alphabetic entries\n\nBoth groups return \"Symbols\" in `keyfunc3` but they're not consecutive, so `groupby()` creates duplicate sections.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n\n**Location 1: Lines 111-112** - Primary sorting logic in `keyfunc` function\n- **Issue**: Incorrect use of `chr(127)` prefix that puts alphabetic entries at the end instead of symbols at the front\n- **Fix needed**: Reverse the logic to put symbols at the front consistently\n\n**Location 2: Lines 153-154** - Sub-entry sorting logic in `keyfunc2` function  \n- **Issue**: Same incorrect logic as Location 1, creating inconsistent symbol sorting in sub-entries\n- **Fix needed**: Apply the same fix as Location 1 to maintain consistency\n\n**Location 3: Lines 167-172** - Grouping logic in `keyfunc3` function\n- **Issue**: Depends on consecutive ordering from sorting, but sorting is inconsistent\n- **Context**: This logic is correct but fails due to the sorting bugs above\n\n**Location 4: Lines 101-102** - Comment describing intended behavior\n- **Issue**: Comment correctly states intention to \"put all symbols at the front\" but implementation does the opposite\n- **Fix needed**: Update comment to match corrected implementation\n\n**Location 5: Line 176** - Final groupby operation\n- **Issue**: Groups consecutive items with same key, but symbols are not consecutive due to sorting bugs\n- **Context**: This line is correct but produces duplicate \"Symbols\" sections due to upstream sorting issues\n\nThe core fix is to reverse the sorting logic in both `keyfunc` and `keyfunc2` functions so that symbols consistently sort before alphabetic characters, ensuring all symbols are grouped together under a single \"Symbols\" section.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where duplicate \"Symbols\" sections are created in the HTML index, I have identified the root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe issue is in the sorting logic that incorrectly handles symbol characters, causing them to be split into two non-consecutive groups. When the grouping function processes these separated symbol groups, it creates duplicate \"Symbols\" sections.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 111,\n            \"end_line\": 112\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 153,\n            \"end_line\": 154\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 167,\n            \"end_line\": 172\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 175,\n            \"end_line\": 176\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe problem statement the project is:\nTwo sections called Symbols in index\nWhen using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries after the ”normal” words.  Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n",

Change the condition to add `chr(127)` prefix to symbols instead of alphabetic characters:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       # Keep alphabetic entries as-is for normal sorting\n       pass\n   else:\n       # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n       lckey = chr(0) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures symbols like `@`, `£`, and `←` all sort before alphabetic entries consistently.\n\n2. **Lines 153-154 (Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`)**: Apply the identical fix as location 1 to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       # Keep alphabetic entries as-is\n       pass\n   else:\n       # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n       key = chr(0) + key\n   ```\n   This prevents sub-entries from creating their own duplicate symbol groups.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Grouping logic in `keyfunc3`)**: This logic is correct and doesn't need changes. It properly returns `_('Symbols')` for all non-alphabetic characters. Once the sorting is fixed in locations 1 and 2, this will group all symbols under a single consecutive section.\n\n4. **Lines 175-176 (Final groupby operation)**: This code is correct and doesn't need changes. The `groupby()` function will work properly once all symbols are sorted consecutively due to the fixes in locations 1 and 2.\n\n**Coordination Note**: The fixes in locations 1 and 2 work together to ensure consistent symbol sorting at both the main entry level and sub-entry level.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the main Sphinx codebase structure at `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/`\n- **Key Finding**: Identified the builders directory containing HTML-specific code\n\n### 2. Code Search and Location\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"Symbols\"\n- **Result**: Found the critical file `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the exact code responsible for \"Symbols\" categorization at lines 169-175\n\n### 3. Root Cause Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` to examine the IndexEntries class\n- **Result**: Identified the bug in the sorting and grouping logic\n\n## Root Cause Identified\n\nThe bug is in `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` in the `create_index` method:\n\n### Problem Details:\n1. **Inconsistent Sorting Logic** (lines 150-155 in `keyfunc2`):\n   - Alphabetic characters and underscores get `chr(127)` prefix added to sort key\n   - Non-alphabetic symbols don't get this prefix\n   - This creates two different sort positions for symbols\n\n2. **Grouping Logic** (lines 158-174 in `keyfunc3`):\n   - All non-alphabetic characters return the same `_('Symbols')` key\n   - However, `groupby()` only groups consecutive items with the same key\n   - Due to inconsistent sorting, symbols end up in non-consecutive positions\n\n3. **Result**: \n   - Some symbols sort early (without chr(127) prefix)\n   - Some symbols sort late (with chr(127) prefix) \n   - Both groups return \"Symbols\" but are separated, creating duplicate sections\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Key Code Locations:\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Method**: `IndexEntries.create_index()`\n- **Problem Functions**: \n  - `keyfunc2()` (lines 149-155): Inconsistent sort key generation\n  - `keyfunc3()` (lines 158-174): Grouping logic that depends on consecutive ordering\n\n### Current Logic Flow:\n1. Entries are sorted using `keyfunc2` \n2. Entries are grouped by `keyfunc3` using `groupby()`\n3. Non-consecutive \"Symbols\" entries create multiple groups\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n### Immediate Fix Options:\n1. **Option A**: Modify `keyfunc2` to ensure all symbols sort together\n2. **Option B**: Modify the grouping logic to merge all \"Symbols\" groups post-processing\n3. **Option C**: Change the sorting strategy to separate alphabetic vs symbolic sorting entirely\n\n### Recommended Approach:\nFix the sorting inconsistency in `keyfunc2` to ensure all symbols are sorted consecutively, which will allow the existing `groupby()` logic to work correctly.\n\n## Current Status\n- ✅ Bug located and root cause identified\n- ✅ Affected code sections mapped\n- ⏳ **Next**: Implement and test the fix\n- ⏳ **Next**: Verify fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\nThe investigation is complete and ready for implementation of the fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 111\nEnd line: 112\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 153\nEnd line: 154\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 167\nEnd line: 172\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nStart line: 175\nEnd line: 176\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on my analysis of the duplicate \"Symbols\" sections bug, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for the identified locations:\n\n1. **Lines 111-112 (Primary sorting function `keyfunc`)**: Reverse the sorting logic to ensure all symbols sort together at the front.

However, this creates inconsistent sorting for symbols:\n   - Some symbols (like `@`) don't get the `chr(127)` prefix, so they sort early\n   - Other symbols that might start with alphabetic-looking characters or underscores get the `chr(127)` prefix and sort late\n3. When `keyfunc3` groups them, both groups return \"Symbols\" but they're not consecutive due to the sorting inconsistency\n\nLet me look at the broader context of the `create_index` method to understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 90, \"end_line\": 120 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 90-120:\n\n  90: \n  91:         # sort the index entries for same keyword.\n  92:         def keyfunc0(entry: Tuple[str, str]) -> Tuple[bool, str]:\n  93:             main, uri = entry\n  94:             return (not main, uri)  # show main entries at first\n  95: \n  96:         for indexentry in new.values():\n  97:             indexentry[0].sort(key=keyfunc0)\n  98:             for subentry in indexentry[1].values():\n  99:                 subentry[0].sort(key=keyfunc0)  # type: ignore\n 100: \n 101:         # sort the index entries; put all symbols at the front, even those\n 102:         # following the letters in ASCII, this is where the chr(127) comes from\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n 116:         newlist = sorted(new.items(), key=keyfunc)\n 117: \n 118:         if group_entries:\n 119:             # fixup entries: transform\n 120:             #   func() (in module foo)\n\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete picture. Looking at the code, I can see there are actually TWO sorting functions that both use the same flawed logic:\n\n1. `keyfunc` (lines 103-115) - used for the main sorting at line 116\n2. `keyfunc2` (lines 149-155) - used for sorting sub-entries at line 162\n\nBoth functions have the same bug: they add `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters and underscores, but this creates inconsistent sorting for symbols. The comment at line 101-102 even mentions \"put all symbols at the front\" but the logic is backwards!\n\nThe issue is that `chr(127)` has a high ASCII value, so adding it as a prefix actually puts items at the END, not the front. This means:\n- Symbols like `@` (without chr(127) prefix) sort early \n- Alphabetic entries (with chr(127) prefix) sort late\n- Some symbols that might be processed differently also end up late\n\nWhen `keyfunc3` groups them, both symbol groups return \"Symbols\" but they're separated by the alphabetic entries in between.\n\nLet me look at the exact locations where the fix needs to be applied.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 101, \"end_line\": 116 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 101-116:\n\n 101:         # sort the index entries; put all symbols at the front, even those\n 102:         # following the letters in ASCII, this is where the chr(127) comes from\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n 116:         newlist = sorted(new.items(), key=keyfunc)\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug! The issue is in the sorting logic that's supposed to put symbols at the front but actually creates two separate symbol groups. Let me identify the exact locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe bug manifests in two identical pieces of flawed logic:\n\n1. **Primary sorting function `keyfunc`** (lines 111-112): Adds `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters, but this puts them at the END, not the front as intended by the comment.\n\n2. **Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`** (lines 153-154): Has the exact same flawed logic.\n\nThe result is that symbols get split into two groups:\n- Early symbols (like `@`) that don't get the chr(127) prefix\n- Late symbols (like `£`, `←`) that somehow get processed differently and end up after alphabetic entries\n\nBoth groups return \"Symbols\" in `keyfunc3` but they're not consecutive, so `groupby()` creates duplicate sections.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n\n**Location 1: Lines 111-112** - Primary sorting logic in `keyfunc` function\n- **Issue**: Incorrect use of `chr(127)` prefix that puts alphabetic entries at the end instead of symbols at the front\n- **Fix needed**: Reverse the logic to put symbols at the front consistently\n\n**Location 2: Lines 153-154** - Sub-entry sorting logic in `keyfunc2` function  \n- **Issue**: Same incorrect logic as Location 1, creating inconsistent symbol sorting in sub-entries\n- **Fix needed**: Apply the same fix as Location 1 to maintain consistency\n\n**Location 3: Lines 167-172** - Grouping logic in `keyfunc3` function\n- **Issue**: Depends on consecutive ordering from sorting, but sorting is inconsistent\n- **Context**: This logic is correct but fails due to the sorting bugs above\n\n**Location 4: Lines 101-102** - Comment describing intended behavior\n- **Issue**: Comment correctly states intention to \"put all symbols at the front\" but implementation does the opposite\n- **Fix needed**: Update comment to match corrected implementation\n\n**Location 5: Line 176** - Final groupby operation\n- **Issue**: Groups consecutive items with same key, but symbols are not consecutive due to sorting bugs\n- **Context**: This line is correct but produces duplicate \"Symbols\" sections due to upstream sorting issues\n\nThe core fix is to reverse the sorting logic in both `keyfunc` and `keyfunc2` functions so that symbols consistently sort before alphabetic characters, ensuring all symbols are grouped together under a single \"Symbols\" section.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where duplicate \"Symbols\" sections are created in the HTML index, I have identified the root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe issue is in the sorting logic that incorrectly handles symbol characters, causing them to be split into two non-consecutive groups. When the grouping function processes these separated symbol groups, it creates duplicate \"Symbols\" sections.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 111,\n            \"end_line\": 112\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 153,\n            \"end_line\": 154\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 167,\n            \"end_line\": 172\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 175,\n            \"end_line\": 176\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the duplicate \"Symbols\" sections bug, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for the identified locations:\n\n1. **Lines 111-112 (Primary sorting function `keyfunc`)**: Reverse the sorting logic to ensure all symbols sort together at the front. Change the condition to add `chr(127)` prefix to symbols instead of alphabetic characters:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       # Keep alphabetic entries as-is for normal sorting\n       pass\n   else:\n       # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n       lckey = chr(0) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures symbols like `@`, `£`, and `←` all sort before alphabetic entries consistently.\n\n2. **Lines 153-154 (Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`)**: Apply the identical fix as location 1 to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       # Keep alphabetic entries as-is\n       pass\n   else:\n       # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n       key = chr(0) + key\n   ```\n   This prevents sub-entries from creating their own duplicate symbol groups.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Grouping logic in `keyfunc3`)**: This logic is correct and doesn't need changes. It properly returns `_('Symbols')` for all non-alphabetic characters. Once the sorting is fixed in locations 1 and 2, this will group all symbols under a single consecutive section.\n\n4. **Lines 175-176 (Final groupby operation)**: This code is correct and doesn't need changes. The `groupby()` function will work properly once all symbols are sorted consecutively due to the fixes in locations 1 and 2.\n\n**Coordination Note**: The fixes in locations 1 and 2 work together to ensure consistent symbol sorting at both the main entry level and sub-entry level. This creates the consecutive ordering that the existing grouping logic (locations 3 and 4) requires to function correctly, eliminating the duplicate \"Symbols\" sections and fixing the anchor link issue.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 111-112\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n                lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 153-154\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n                key = chr(127) + key\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 167-172\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n                if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n                    return letter\n                else:\n                    # get all other symbols under one heading\n                    return _('Symbols')\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 175-176\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        return [(key_, list(group))\n                for (key_, group) in groupby(newlist, keyfunc3)]\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nTwo sections called Symbols in index\nWhen using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries after the ”normal” words.

The `groupby` function on line 176 groups consecutive items with the same key, but because some symbols get sorted to the beginning (without chr(127) prefix) and others get sorted to the end (with chr(127) prefix), they end up in separate groups even though they all return the same \"Symbols\" key.\n\nLet me examine the complete `keyfunc2` function to understand the full sorting logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 140, \"end_line\": 160 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 140-160:\n\n 140:                             del newlist[i]\n 141:                             continue\n 142:                         oldkey = m.group(1)\n 143:                     else:\n 144:                         oldkey = key\n 145:                 oldsubitems = subitems\n 146:                 i += 1\n 147: \n 148:         # sort the sub-index entries\n 149:         def keyfunc2(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n 150:             key = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', entry[0].lower())\n 151:             if key.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 152:                 key = key[1:]\n 153:             if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n 154:                 key = chr(127) + key\n 155:             return key\n 156: \n 157:         # group the entries by letter\n 158:         def keyfunc3(item: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n 159:             # hack: mutating the subitems dicts to a list in the keyfunc\n 160:             k, v = item\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug! The issue is in the sorting logic in `keyfunc2`. Let me analyze what's happening:\n\n1. In `keyfunc2` (lines 149-155), the logic adds `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters and underscores to sort them later\n2. However, this creates inconsistent sorting for symbols:\n   - Some symbols (like `@`) don't get the `chr(127)` prefix, so they sort early\n   - Other symbols that might start with alphabetic-looking characters or underscores get the `chr(127)` prefix and sort late\n3. When `keyfunc3` groups them, both groups return \"Symbols\" but they're not consecutive due to the sorting inconsistency\n\nLet me look at the broader context of the `create_index` method to understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 90, \"end_line\": 120 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 90-120:\n\n  90: \n  91:         # sort the index entries for same keyword.\n  92:         def keyfunc0(entry: Tuple[str, str]) -> Tuple[bool, str]:\n  93:             main, uri = entry\n  94:             return (not main, uri)  # show main entries at first\n  95: \n  96:         for indexentry in new.values():\n  97:             indexentry[0].sort(key=keyfunc0)\n  98:             for subentry in indexentry[1].values():\n  99:                 subentry[0].sort(key=keyfunc0)  # type: ignore\n 100: \n 101:         # sort the index entries; put all symbols at the front, even those\n 102:         # following the letters in ASCII, this is where the chr(127) comes from\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n 116:         newlist = sorted(new.items(), key=keyfunc)\n 117: \n 118:         if group_entries:\n 119:             # fixup entries: transform\n 120:             #   func() (in module foo)\n\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete picture. Looking at the code, I can see there are actually TWO sorting functions that both use the same flawed logic:\n\n1. `keyfunc` (lines 103-115) - used for the main sorting at line 116\n2. `keyfunc2` (lines 149-155) - used for sorting sub-entries at line 162\n\nBoth functions have the same bug: they add `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters and underscores, but this creates inconsistent sorting for symbols. The comment at line 101-102 even mentions \"put all symbols at the front\" but the logic is backwards!\n\nThe issue is that `chr(127)` has a high ASCII value, so adding it as a prefix actually puts items at the END, not the front. This means:\n- Symbols like `@` (without chr(127) prefix) sort early \n- Alphabetic entries (with chr(127) prefix) sort late\n- Some symbols that might be processed differently also end up late\n\nWhen `keyfunc3` groups them, both symbol groups return \"Symbols\" but they're separated by the alphabetic entries in between.\n\nLet me look at the exact locations where the fix needs to be applied.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 101, \"end_line\": 116 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 101-116:\n\n 101:         # sort the index entries; put all symbols at the front, even those\n 102:         # following the letters in ASCII, this is where the chr(127) comes from\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n 116:         newlist = sorted(new.items(), key=keyfunc)\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug! The issue is in the sorting logic that's supposed to put symbols at the front but actually creates two separate symbol groups. Let me identify the exact locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe bug manifests in two identical pieces of flawed logic:\n\n1. **Primary sorting function `keyfunc`** (lines 111-112): Adds `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters, but this puts them at the END, not the front as intended by the comment.\n\n2. **Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`** (lines 153-154): Has the exact same flawed logic.\n\nThe result is that symbols get split into two groups:\n- Early symbols (like `@`) that don't get the chr(127) prefix\n- Late symbols (like `£`, `←`) that somehow get processed differently and end up after alphabetic entries\n\nBoth groups return \"Symbols\" in `keyfunc3` but they're not consecutive, so `groupby()` creates duplicate sections.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n\n**Location 1: Lines 111-112** - Primary sorting logic in `keyfunc` function\n- **Issue**: Incorrect use of `chr(127)` prefix that puts alphabetic entries at the end instead of symbols at the front\n- **Fix needed**: Reverse the logic to put symbols at the front consistently\n\n**Location 2: Lines 153-154** - Sub-entry sorting logic in `keyfunc2` function  \n- **Issue**: Same incorrect logic as Location 1, creating inconsistent symbol sorting in sub-entries\n- **Fix needed**: Apply the same fix as Location 1 to maintain consistency\n\n**Location 3: Lines 167-172** - Grouping logic in `keyfunc3` function\n- **Issue**: Depends on consecutive ordering from sorting, but sorting is inconsistent\n- **Context**: This logic is correct but fails due to the sorting bugs above\n\n**Location 4: Lines 101-102** - Comment describing intended behavior\n- **Issue**: Comment correctly states intention to \"put all symbols at the front\" but implementation does the opposite\n- **Fix needed**: Update comment to match corrected implementation\n\n**Location 5: Line 176** - Final groupby operation\n- **Issue**: Groups consecutive items with same key, but symbols are not consecutive due to sorting bugs\n- **Context**: This line is correct but produces duplicate \"Symbols\" sections due to upstream sorting issues\n\nThe core fix is to reverse the sorting logic in both `keyfunc` and `keyfunc2` functions so that symbols consistently sort before alphabetic characters, ensuring all symbols are grouped together under a single \"Symbols\" section.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where duplicate \"Symbols\" sections are created in the HTML index, I have identified the root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe issue is in the sorting logic that incorrectly handles symbol characters, causing them to be split into two non-consecutive groups. When the grouping function processes these separated symbol groups, it creates duplicate \"Symbols\" sections.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 111,\n            \"end_line\": 112\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 153,\n            \"end_line\": 154\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 167,\n            \"end_line\": 172\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 175,\n            \"end_line\": 176\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the duplicate \"Symbols\" sections bug, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for the identified locations:\n\n1. **Lines 111-112 (Primary sorting function `keyfunc`)**: Reverse the sorting logic to ensure all symbols sort together at the front. Change the condition to add `chr(127)` prefix to symbols instead of alphabetic characters:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       # Keep alphabetic entries as-is for normal sorting\n       pass\n   else:\n       # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n       lckey = chr(0) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures symbols like `@`, `£`, and `←` all sort before alphabetic entries consistently.\n\n2. **Lines 153-154 (Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`)**: Apply the identical fix as location 1 to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       # Keep alphabetic entries as-is\n       pass\n   else:\n       # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n       key = chr(0) + key\n   ```\n   This prevents sub-entries from creating their own duplicate symbol groups.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Grouping logic in `keyfunc3`)**: This logic is correct and doesn't need changes. It properly returns `_('Symbols')` for all non-alphabetic characters. Once the sorting is fixed in locations 1 and 2, this will group all symbols under a single consecutive section.\n\n4. **Lines 175-176 (Final groupby operation)**: This code is correct and doesn't need changes. The `groupby()` function will work properly once all symbols are sorted consecutively due to the fixes in locations 1 and 2.\n\n**Coordination Note**: The fixes in locations 1 and 2 work together to ensure consistent symbol sorting at both the main entry level and sub-entry level. This creates the consecutive ordering that the existing grouping logic (locations 3 and 4) requires to function correctly, eliminating the duplicate \"Symbols\" sections and fixing the anchor link issue.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 111-112\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n                lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 153-154\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n                key = chr(127) + key\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 167-172\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n                if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n                    return letter\n                else:\n                    # get all other symbols under one heading\n                    return _('Symbols')\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 175-176\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        return [(key_, list(group))\n                for (key_, group) in groupby(newlist, keyfunc3)]\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n#REFLECT\nLooking at the code segments provided, I can see the exact issue now. The problem is in the sorting logic in locations 1 and 2:\n\n- Location 1 (lines 111-112): `chr(127)` is added to alphabetic characters and underscores, which puts them at the END of sorting (since chr(127) has high ASCII value)\n- Location 2 (lines 153-154): Same flawed logic for sub-entries\n- This means symbols without the chr(127) prefix sort BEFORE alphabetic entries, and any symbols that somehow get the prefix sort AFTER alphabetic entries\n- Location 3 correctly groups all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\" \n- Location 4 uses groupby() which only groups consecutive items\n- Result: Two separate \"Symbols\" groups with alphabetic entries in between\n\nThe fix is clear - reverse the logic in locations 1 and 2 so symbols get a low-value prefix (like chr(0)) to sort at the front, while alphabetic characters sort normally without any prefix.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe locations are ready for fixing. The root cause is clear:\n\n1. **Locations 1 & 2** have inverted sorting logic that splits symbols into two non-consecutive groups\n2. **Location 3** correctly identifies all symbols but can't group them due to the sorting issue  \n3. **Location 4** works correctly but produces duplicate sections due to the upstream sorting bug\n\nThe fix involves reversing the sorting logic in locations 1 and 2 to ensure all symbols sort consecutively at the front, which will allow the existing grouping logic in locations 3 and 4 to work properly and create a single \"Symbols\" section.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 111-112\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import re\n  import unicodedata\n  from itertools import groupby\n  from typing import Any, Dict, Pattern, List, Tuple\n  from typing import cast\n  from sphinx.builders import Builder\n  from sphinx.domains.index import IndexDomain\n  from sphinx.environment import BuildEnvironment\n  from sphinx.errors import NoUri\n  from sphinx.locale import _, __\n  from sphinx.util import split_into, logging\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  101:         #

Change the condition to add `chr(127)` prefix to symbols instead of alphabetic characters:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       # Keep alphabetic entries as-is for normal sorting\n       pass\n   else:\n       # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n       lckey = chr(0) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures symbols like `@`, `£`, and `←` all sort before alphabetic entries consistently.\n\n2. **Lines 153-154 (Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`)**: Apply the identical fix as location 1 to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       # Keep alphabetic entries as-is\n       pass\n   else:\n       # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n       key = chr(0) + key\n   ```\n   This prevents sub-entries from creating their own duplicate symbol groups.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Grouping logic in `keyfunc3`)**: This logic is correct and doesn't need changes. It properly returns `_('Symbols')` for all non-alphabetic characters. Once the sorting is fixed in locations 1 and 2, this will group all symbols under a single consecutive section.\n\n4. **Lines 175-176 (Final groupby operation)**: This code is correct and doesn't need changes. The `groupby()` function will work properly once all symbols are sorted consecutively due to the fixes in locations 1 and 2.\n\n**Coordination Note**: The fixes in locations 1 and 2 work together to ensure consistent symbol sorting at both the main entry level and sub-entry level. This creates the consecutive ordering that the existing grouping logic (locations 3 and 4) requires to function correctly, eliminating the duplicate \"Symbols\" sections and fixing the anchor link issue.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nTwo sections called Symbols in index\nWhen using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries after the ”normal” words.

Change the condition to add `chr(127)` prefix to symbols instead of alphabetic characters:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       # Keep alphabetic entries as-is for normal sorting\n       pass\n   else:\n       # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n       lckey = chr(0) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures symbols like `@`, `£`, and `←` all sort before alphabetic entries consistently.\n\n2. **Lines 153-154 (Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`)**: Apply the identical fix as location 1 to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       # Keep alphabetic entries as-is\n       pass\n   else:\n       # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n       key = chr(0) + key\n   ```\n   This prevents sub-entries from creating their own duplicate symbol groups.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Grouping logic in `keyfunc3`)**: This logic is correct and doesn't need changes. It properly returns `_('Symbols')` for all non-alphabetic characters. Once the sorting is fixed in locations 1 and 2, this will group all symbols under a single consecutive section.\n\n4. **Lines 175-176 (Final groupby operation)**: This code is correct and doesn't need changes. The `groupby()` function will work properly once all symbols are sorted consecutively due to the fixes in locations 1 and 2.\n\n**Coordination Note**: The fixes in locations 1 and 2 work together to ensure consistent symbol sorting at both the main entry level and sub-entry level.

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Bug Investigation Summary: Duplicate \"Symbols\" Sections in Sphinx HTML Index\n\n## Main Objective\nInvestigate and repair a bug in the Sphinx documentation generator where HTML index output creates duplicate \"Symbols\" sections instead of grouping all special character entries (like @, £, ←) under a single \"Symbols\" heading.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the main Sphinx codebase structure at `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/`\n- **Key Finding**: Identified the builders directory containing HTML-specific code\n\n### 2. Code Search and Location\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"Symbols\"\n- **Result**: Found the critical file `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the exact code responsible for \"Symbols\" categorization at lines 169-175\n\n### 3. Root Cause Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` to examine the IndexEntries class\n- **Result**: Identified the bug in the sorting and grouping logic\n\n## Root Cause Identified\n\nThe bug is in `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` in the `create_index` method:\n\n### Problem Details:\n1. **Inconsistent Sorting Logic** (lines 150-155 in `keyfunc2`):\n   - Alphabetic characters and underscores get `chr(127)` prefix added to sort key\n   - Non-alphabetic symbols don't get this prefix\n   - This creates two different sort positions for symbols\n\n2. **Grouping Logic** (lines 158-174 in `keyfunc3`):\n   - All non-alphabetic characters return the same `_('Symbols')` key\n   - However, `groupby()` only groups consecutive items with the same key\n   - Due to inconsistent sorting, symbols end up in non-consecutive positions\n\n3. **Result**: \n   - Some symbols sort early (without chr(127) prefix)\n   - Some symbols sort late (with chr(127) prefix) \n   - Both groups return \"Symbols\" but are separated, creating duplicate sections\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Key Code Locations:\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Method**: `IndexEntries.create_index()`\n- **Problem Functions**: \n  - `keyfunc2()` (lines 149-155): Inconsistent sort key generation\n  - `keyfunc3()` (lines 158-174): Grouping logic that depends on consecutive ordering\n\n### Current Logic Flow:\n1. Entries are sorted using `keyfunc2` \n2. Entries are grouped by `keyfunc3` using `groupby()`\n3. Non-consecutive \"Symbols\" entries create multiple groups\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n### Immediate Fix Options:\n1. **Option A**: Modify `keyfunc2` to ensure all symbols sort together\n2. **Option B**: Modify the grouping logic to merge all \"Symbols\" groups post-processing\n3. **Option C**: Change the sorting strategy to separate alphabetic vs symbolic sorting entirely\n\n### Recommended Approach:\nFix the sorting inconsistency in `keyfunc2` to ensure all symbols are sorted consecutively, which will allow the existing `groupby()` logic to work correctly.\n\n## Current Status\n- ✅ Bug located and root cause identified\n- ✅ Affected code sections mapped\n- ⏳ **Next**: Implement and test the fix\n- ⏳ **Next**: Verify fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\nThe investigation is complete and ready for implementation of the fix.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nI can see the issue is in the IndexEntries class. The problem is likely in the grouping logic that determines how entries are categorized. Let me continue reading the file to see the complete logic, especially around lines 169-175 where the \"Symbols\" categorization happens.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 150, \"end_line\": 176 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 150-176:\n\n 150:             key = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', entry[0].lower())\n 151:             if key.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 152:                 key = key[1:]\n 153:             if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n 154:                 key = chr(127) + key\n 155:             return key\n 156: \n 157:         # group the entries by letter\n 158:         def keyfunc3(item: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n 159:             # hack: mutating the subitems dicts to a list in the keyfunc\n 160:             k, v = item\n 161:             v[1] = sorted(((si, se) for (si, (se, void, void)) in v[1].items()),\n 162:                           key=keyfunc2)\n 163:             if v[2] is None:\n 164:                 # now calculate the key\n 165:                 if k.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 166:                     k = k[1:]\n 167:                 letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n 168:                 if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n 169:                     return letter\n 170:                 else:\n 171:                     # get all other symbols under one heading\n 172:                     return _('Symbols')\n 173:             else:\n 174:                 return v[2]\n 175:         return [(key_, list(group))\n 176:                 for (key_, group) in groupby(newlist, keyfunc3)]\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I can see the issue! Looking at the code in lines 150-176, I can see the problem:\n\n1. In `keyfunc2` (lines 150-155), entries starting with non-alphabetic characters get a `chr(127)` prefix added to their sort key, which puts them at the end of the sorting order.\n\n2. In `keyfunc3` (lines 158-174), all non-alphabetic characters are grouped under the same \"Symbols\" heading.\n\n3. The `groupby` function on line 176 groups consecutive items with the same key, but because some symbols get sorted to the beginning (without chr(127) prefix) and others get sorted to the end (with chr(127) prefix), they end up in separate groups even though they all return the same \"Symbols\" key.\n\nLet me examine the complete `keyfunc2` function to understand the full sorting logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 140, \"end_line\": 160 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 140-160:\n\n 140:                             del newlist[i]\n 141:                             continue\n 142:                         oldkey = m.group(1)\n 143:                     else:\n 144:                         oldkey = key\n 145:                 oldsubitems = subitems\n 146:                 i += 1\n 147: \n 148:         # sort the sub-index entries\n 149:         def keyfunc2(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n 150:             key = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', entry[0].lower())\n 151:             if key.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 152:                 key = key[1:]\n 153:             if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n 154:                 key = chr(127) + key\n 155:             return key\n 156: \n 157:         # group the entries by letter\n 158:         def keyfunc3(item: Tuple[str, List]) -> str:\n 159:             # hack: mutating the subitems dicts to a list in the keyfunc\n 160:             k, v = item\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug! The issue is in the sorting logic in `keyfunc2`. Let me analyze what's happening:\n\n1. In `keyfunc2` (lines 149-155), the logic adds `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters and underscores to sort them later\n2. However, this creates inconsistent sorting for symbols:\n   - Some symbols (like `@`) don't get the `chr(127)` prefix, so they sort early\n   - Other symbols that might start with alphabetic-looking characters or underscores get the `chr(127)` prefix and sort late\n3. When `keyfunc3` groups them, both groups return \"Symbols\" but they're not consecutive due to the sorting inconsistency\n\nLet me look at the broader context of the `create_index` method to understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 90, \"end_line\": 120 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 90-120:\n\n  90: \n  91:         # sort the index entries for same keyword.\n  92:         def keyfunc0(entry: Tuple[str, str]) -> Tuple[bool, str]:\n  93:             main, uri = entry\n  94:             return (not main, uri)  # show main entries at first\n  95: \n  96:         for indexentry in new.values():\n  97:             indexentry[0].sort(key=keyfunc0)\n  98:             for subentry in indexentry[1].values():\n  99:                 subentry[0].sort(key=keyfunc0)  # type: ignore\n 100: \n 101:         # sort the index entries; put all symbols at the front, even those\n 102:         # following the letters in ASCII, this is where the chr(127) comes from\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n 116:         newlist = sorted(new.items(), key=keyfunc)\n 117: \n 118:         if group_entries:\n 119:             # fixup entries: transform\n 120:             #   func() (in module foo)\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete picture. Looking at the code, I can see there are actually TWO sorting functions that both use the same flawed logic:\n\n1. `keyfunc` (lines 103-115) - used for the main sorting at line 116\n2. `keyfunc2` (lines 149-155) - used for sorting sub-entries at line 162\n\nBoth functions have the same bug: they add `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters and underscores, but this creates inconsistent sorting for symbols. The comment at line 101-102 even mentions \"put all symbols at the front\" but the logic is backwards!\n\nThe issue is that `chr(127)` has a high ASCII value, so adding it as a prefix actually puts items at the END, not the front. This means:\n- Symbols like `@` (without chr(127) prefix) sort early \n- Alphabetic entries (with chr(127) prefix) sort late\n- Some symbols that might be processed differently also end up late\n\nWhen `keyfunc3` groups them, both symbol groups return \"Symbols\" but they're separated by the alphabetic entries in between.\n\nLet me look at the exact locations where the fix needs to be applied.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\", \"start_line\": 101, \"end_line\": 116 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\nTotal lines: 176\nShowing lines 101-116:\n\n 101:         # sort the index entries; put all symbols at the front, even those\n 102:         # following the letters in ASCII, this is where the chr(127) comes from\n 103:         def keyfunc(entry: Tuple[str, List]) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n 104:             key, (void, void, category_key) = entry\n 105:             if category_key:\n 106:                 # using specified category key to sort\n 107:                 key = category_key\n 108:             lckey = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', key.lower())\n 109:             if lckey.startswith('\\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):\n 110:                 lckey = lckey[1:]\n 111:             if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n 112:                 lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n 113:             # ensure a determinstic order *within* letters by also sorting on\n 114:             # the entry itself\n 115:             return (lckey, entry[0])\n 116:         newlist = sorted(new.items(), key=keyfunc)\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug! The issue is in the sorting logic that's supposed to put symbols at the front but actually creates two separate symbol groups. Let me identify the exact locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe bug manifests in two identical pieces of flawed logic:\n\n1. **Primary sorting function `keyfunc`** (lines 111-112): Adds `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters, but this puts them at the END, not the front as intended by the comment.\n\n2. **Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`** (lines 153-154): Has the exact same flawed logic.\n\nThe result is that symbols get split into two groups:\n- Early symbols (like `@`) that don't get the chr(127) prefix\n- Late symbols (like `£`, `←`) that somehow get processed differently and end up after alphabetic entries\n\nBoth groups return \"Symbols\" in `keyfunc3` but they're not consecutive, so `groupby()` creates duplicate sections.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n\n**Location 1: Lines 111-112** - Primary sorting logic in `keyfunc` function\n- **Issue**: Incorrect use of `chr(127)` prefix that puts alphabetic entries at the end instead of symbols at the front\n- **Fix needed**: Reverse the logic to put symbols at the front consistently\n\n**Location 2: Lines 153-154** - Sub-entry sorting logic in `keyfunc2` function  \n- **Issue**: Same incorrect logic as Location 1, creating inconsistent symbol sorting in sub-entries\n- **Fix needed**: Apply the same fix as Location 1 to maintain consistency\n\n**Location 3: Lines 167-172** - Grouping logic in `keyfunc3` function\n- **Issue**: Depends on consecutive ordering from sorting, but sorting is inconsistent\n- **Context**: This logic is correct but fails due to the sorting bugs above\n\n**Location 4: Lines 101-102** - Comment describing intended behavior\n- **Issue**: Comment correctly states intention to \"put all symbols at the front\" but implementation does the opposite\n- **Fix needed**: Update comment to match corrected implementation\n\n**Location 5: Line 176** - Final groupby operation\n- **Issue**: Groups consecutive items with same key, but symbols are not consecutive due to sorting bugs\n- **Context**: This line is correct but produces duplicate \"Symbols\" sections due to upstream sorting issues\n\nThe core fix is to reverse the sorting logic in both `keyfunc` and `keyfunc2` functions so that symbols consistently sort before alphabetic characters, ensuring all symbols are grouped together under a single \"Symbols\" section.\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where duplicate \"Symbols\" sections are created in the HTML index, I have identified the root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed.\n\nThe issue is in the sorting logic that incorrectly handles symbol characters, causing them to be split into two non-consecutive groups. When the grouping function processes these separated symbol groups, it creates duplicate \"Symbols\" sections.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 111,\n            \"end_line\": 112\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 153,\n            \"end_line\": 154\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 167,\n            \"end_line\": 172\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 175,\n            \"end_line\": 176\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nAssistant: PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the duplicate \"Symbols\" sections bug, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for the identified locations:\n\n1. **Lines 111-112 (Primary sorting function `keyfunc`)**: Reverse the sorting logic to ensure all symbols sort together at the front. Change the condition to add `chr(127)` prefix to symbols instead of alphabetic characters:\n   ```python\n   if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n       # Keep alphabetic entries as-is for normal sorting\n       pass\n   else:\n       # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n       lckey = chr(0) + lckey\n   ```\n   This ensures symbols like `@`, `£`, and `←` all sort before alphabetic entries consistently.\n\n2. **Lines 153-154 (Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`)**: Apply the identical fix as location 1 to maintain consistency between main entries and sub-entries:\n   ```python\n   if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n       # Keep alphabetic entries as-is\n       pass\n   else:\n       # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n       key = chr(0) + key\n   ```\n   This prevents sub-entries from creating their own duplicate symbol groups.\n\n3. **Lines 167-172 (Grouping logic in `keyfunc3`)**: This logic is correct and doesn't need changes. It properly returns `_('Symbols')` for all non-alphabetic characters. Once the sorting is fixed in locations 1 and 2, this will group all symbols under a single consecutive section.\n\n4. **Lines 175-176 (Final groupby operation)**: This code is correct and doesn't need changes. The `groupby()` function will work properly once all symbols are sorted consecutively due to the fixes in locations 1 and 2.\n\n**Coordination Note**: The fixes in locations 1 and 2 work together to ensure consistent symbol sorting at both the main entry level and sub-entry level. This creates the consecutive ordering that the existing grouping logic (locations 3 and 4) requires to function correctly, eliminating the duplicate \"Symbols\" sections and fixing the anchor link issue.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 111-112\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n                lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 153-154\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n                key = chr(127) + key\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 167-172\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n                if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n                    return letter\n                else:\n                    # get all other symbols under one heading\n                    return _('Symbols')\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 175-176\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        return [(key_, list(group))\n                for (key_, group) in groupby(newlist, keyfunc3)]\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nLooking at the code segments provided, I can see the exact issue now. The problem is in the sorting logic in locations 1 and 2:\n\n- Location 1 (lines 111-112): `chr(127)` is added to alphabetic characters and underscores, which puts them at the END of sorting (since chr(127) has high ASCII value)\n- Location 2 (lines 153-154): Same flawed logic for sub-entries\n- This means symbols without the chr(127) prefix sort BEFORE alphabetic entries, and any symbols that somehow get the prefix sort AFTER alphabetic entries\n- Location 3 correctly groups all non-alphabetic characters as \"Symbols\" \n- Location 4 uses groupby() which only groups consecutive items\n- Result: Two separate \"Symbols\" groups with alphabetic entries in between\n\nThe fix is clear - reverse the logic in locations 1 and 2 so symbols get a low-value prefix (like chr(0)) to sort at the front, while alphabetic characters sort normally without any prefix.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe locations are ready for fixing. The root cause is clear:\n\n1. **Locations 1 & 2** have inverted sorting logic that splits symbols into two non-consecutive groups\n2. **Location 3** correctly identifies all symbols but can't group them due to the sorting issue  \n3. **Location 4** works correctly but produces duplicate sections due to the upstream sorting bug\n\nThe fix involves reversing the sorting logic in locations 1 and 2 to ensure all symbols sort consecutively at the front, which will allow the existing grouping logic in locations 3 and 4 to work properly and create a single \"Symbols\" section.\nUser: [Location 1] /root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py lines 111-112\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import re\n  import unicodedata\n  from itertools import groupby\n  from typing import Any, Dict, Pattern, List, Tuple\n  from typing import cast\n  from sphinx.builders import Builder\n  from sphinx.domains.index import IndexDomain\n  from sphinx.environment import BuildEnvironment\n  from sphinx.errors import NoUri\n  from sphinx.locale import _, __\n  from sphinx.util import split_into, logging\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  101:         #

This creates the consecutive ordering that the existing grouping logic (locations 3 and 4) requires to function correctly, eliminating the duplicate \"Symbols\" sections and fixing the anchor link issue.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\n\nAssistant: #PROPOSE PATCH\n\n```python\n            if lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n                # Keep alphabetic entries as-is for normal sorting\n                pass\n            else:\n                # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n                lckey = chr(0) + lckey\n```\n\n```python\n            if key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n                # Keep alphabetic entries as-is\n                pass\n            else:\n                # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n                key = chr(0) + key\n```\n\n```python\n                letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()\n                if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':\n                    return letter\n                else:\n                    # get all other symbols under one heading\n                    return _('Symbols')\n```\n\n```python\n        return [(key_, list(group))\n                for (key_, group) in groupby(newlist, keyfunc3)]\n```\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that:\n1.

    "response": "# Bug Investigation and Repair Summary: Duplicate \"Symbols\" Sections in Sphinx HTML Index\n\n## Main Objective\nInvestigate and repair a bug in the Sphinx documentation generator where HTML index output creates duplicate \"Symbols\" sections instead of grouping all special character entries (like @, £, ←) under a single \"Symbols\" heading.\n\n## Investigation Phase - Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the main Sphinx codebase structure at `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/`\n- **Key Finding**: Identified the builders directory containing HTML-specific code\n\n### 2. Code Search and Location\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"Symbols\"\n- **Result**: Found the critical file `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Key Finding**: Located the exact code responsible for \"Symbols\" categorization at lines 169-175\n\n### 3. Root Cause Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` to examine the IndexEntries class\n- **Result**: Identified the bug in the sorting and grouping logic\n\n## Root Cause Identified\n\nThe bug is in `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` in the `create_index` method:\n\n### Problem Details:\n1. **Inconsistent Sorting Logic** in two functions:\n   - **`keyfunc` (lines 111-112)**: Primary sorting function adds `chr(127)` prefix to alphabetic characters and underscores\n   - **`keyfunc2` (lines 153-154)**: Sub-entry sorting function with identical flawed logic\n   - **Issue**: `chr(127)` has high ASCII value, so it sorts alphabetic entries at the END, not symbols at the front as intended\n\n2. **Grouping Logic** (lines 167-172 in `keyfunc3`):\n   - All non-alphabetic characters correctly return the same `_('Symbols')` key\n   - However, `groupby()` only groups consecutive items with the same key\n   - Due to inconsistent sorting, symbols end up in non-consecutive positions\n\n3. **Result**: \n   - Some symbols sort early (without chr(127) prefix)\n   - Alphabetic entries sort in the middle (with chr(127) prefix)\n   - Some symbols sort late (creating separation)\n   - Both symbol groups return \"Symbols\" but are separated, creating duplicate sections\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Key Code Locations:\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/sphinx/sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`\n- **Method**: `IndexEntries.create_index()`\n- **Problem Functions**: \n  - `keyfunc()` (lines 111-112): Primary sorting with incorrect chr(127) logic\n  - `keyfunc2()` (lines 153-154): Sub-entry sorting with same incorrect logic\n  - `keyfunc3()` (lines 167-172): Correct grouping logic that fails due to sorting issues\n  - Final groupby (lines 175-176): Correct but produces duplicates due to upstream sorting\n\n### Current Logic Flow:\n1. Entries are sorted using `keyfunc` with flawed chr(127) logic\n2. Sub-entries are sorted using `keyfunc2` with same flawed logic\n3. Entries are grouped by `keyfunc3` using `groupby()`\n4. Non-consecutive \"Symbols\" entries create multiple groups\n\n## Repair Phase - Solution Implemented\n\n### Fix Strategy:\nReverse the sorting logic in both `keyfunc` and `keyfunc2` functions to ensure all symbols sort consistently at the front, allowing the existing grouping logic to work correctly.\n\n### Specific Changes Made:\n\n#### Location 1: Lines 111-112 (Primary sorting function `keyfunc`)\n**Before:**\n```python\nif lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n    lckey = chr(127) + lckey\n```\n\n**After:**\n```python\nif lckey[0:1].isalpha() or lckey.startswith('_'):\n    # Keep alphabetic entries as-is for normal sorting\n    pass\nelse:\n    # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n    lckey = chr(0) + lckey\n```\n\n#### Location 2: Lines 153-154 (Sub-entry sorting function `keyfunc2`)\n**Before:**\n```python\nif key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n    key = chr(127) + key\n```\n\n**After:**\n```python\nif key[0:1].isalpha() or key.startswith('_'):\n    # Keep alphabetic entries as-is\n    pass\nelse:\n    # Add prefix to symbols to sort them at the front\n    key = chr(0) + key\n```\n\n#### Locations 3 & 4: No Changes Required\n- **Lines 167-172 (keyfunc3)**: Grouping logic is correct and unchanged\n- **Lines 175-176 (groupby)**: Final grouping operation is correct and unchanged\n\n### Fix Rationale:\n1. **Consistent Symbol Sorting**: Using `chr(0)` prefix for symbols ensures they all sort before any alphabetic characters\n2. **Alphabetic Entries**: Removing the chr(127) prefix allows alphabetic entries to sort naturally\n3. **Consecutive Grouping**: All symbols now sort consecutively, allowing `groupby()` to create a single \"Symbols\" section\n4. **Backward Compatibility**: The change maintains the intended behavior (symbols first, then alphabetic) while fixing the implementation\n\n## Current Status\n- ✅ Bug located and root cause identified\n- ✅ Solution designed and coordinated across multiple locations\n- ✅ **Patches proposed and ready for implementation**\n- ⏳ **Next**: Apply patches and test the fix\n- ⏳ **Next**: Verify fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Key Technical Insights\n- The bug was caused by a misunderstanding of ASCII values: `chr(127)` sorts at the end, not the beginning\n- The comment at lines 101-102 correctly described the intention but the implementation was backwards\n- The fix required coordinated changes to both main entry and sub-entry sorting to prevent inconsistencies\n- The existing grouping logic was correct and didn't need modification\n\nThe investigation is complete and the repair solution has been fully designed and proposed for implementation.",
