What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb’GET’\nto\n\"b'GET’\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET’”, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n",

The problem is:\n\n1. In `requests/sessions.py`, there's a line `method = builtin_str(method)`\n2. When the method is a binary string like `b'GET'`, this converts it to the literal string `\"b'GET'\"` instead of just `'GET'`\n3. This causes 404 errors because the HTTP method becomes invalid\n4.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Bug Investigation and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the requests library where HTTP methods passed as binary strings (e.g., `b'GET'`) are incorrectly converted to literal string representations (`\"b'GET'\"`) instead of proper string values (`'GET'`), causing 404 errors.\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n### Bug Location and Root Cause\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py`\n- **Line**: 428 - `method = builtin_str(method)`\n- **Issue**: The `builtin_str()` function handles binary strings differently between Python versions:\n  - Python 2.6: Correctly converts `b'GET'` to `'GET'`\n  - Python 3.4: Incorrectly converts `b'GET'` to `\"b'GET'\"` (literal string representation)\n\n### Code Context\nThe problematic code is in the `Session.request()` method (lines 378-449):\n```python\ndef request(self, method, url, ...):\n    \"\"\"Constructs a Request, prepares it and sends it.\"\"\"\n    \n    method = builtin_str(method)  # Line 428 - THE BUG\n    \n    # Create the Request.\n    req = Request(\n        method = method.upper(),  # Line 432 - Uses the incorrectly converted method\n        url = url,\n        ...\n    )\n```\n\n## Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the requests library structure with main code in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/`\n- **Key Files Identified**: `sessions.py` (contains the bug), `compat.py` (likely contains `builtin_str`)\n\n### 2. Bug Location Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Result**: Found the exact line 428 with `method = builtin_str(method)`\n- **Context**: Located within the `Session.request()` method that handles all HTTP requests\n\n### 3. Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Result**: Analyzed the surrounding code context (lines 360-449)\n- **Key Finding**: The converted method is used in `method.upper()` on line 432, which would fail with malformed method names\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located the exact bug in `sessions.py` line 428\n- Identified the root cause (Python version compatibility issue with `builtin_str()`)\n- Understood the code flow and impact\n\n### 🔄 Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine `builtin_str()` implementation** in `compat.py` to understand the version differences\n2. **Create a test case** to reproduce the bug with binary string methods\n3. **Implement the fix** - likely need to properly decode binary strings before using `builtin_str()`\n4. **Test the fix** across Python versions to ensure compatibility\n\n## Technical Decisions Needed\n\n### Fix Strategy Options\n1. **Replace `builtin_str(method)`** with a custom function that properly handles binary strings\n2. **Add preprocessing** to decode binary strings before calling `builtin_str()`\n3. **Use a different conversion approach** that's consistent across Python versions\n\n### Recommended Next Action\nExamine the `builtin_str()` function in `compat.py` to understand its implementation and determine the most appropriate fix strategy that maintains backward compatibility while resolving the Python 3.4 issue.\n\nThe bug is clearly identified and the fix location is known.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Bug Investigation and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the requests library where HTTP methods passed as binary strings (e.g., `b'GET'`) are incorrectly converted to literal string representations (`\"b'GET'\"`) instead of proper string values (`'GET'`), causing 404 errors.\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n### Bug Location and Root Cause\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py`\n- **Line**: 428 - `method = builtin_str(method)`\n- **Issue**: The `builtin_str()` function handles binary strings differently between Python versions:\n  - Python 2.6: Correctly converts `b'GET'` to `'GET'`\n  - Python 3.4: Incorrectly converts `b'GET'` to `\"b'GET'\"` (literal string representation)\n\n### Code Context\nThe problematic code is in the `Session.request()` method (lines 378-449):\n```python\ndef request(self, method, url, ...):\n    \"\"\"Constructs a Request, prepares it and sends it.\"\"\"\n    \n    method = builtin_str(method)  # Line 428 - THE BUG\n    \n    # Create the Request.\n    req = Request(\n        method = method.upper(),  # Line 432 - Uses the incorrectly converted method\n        url = url,\n        ...\n    )\n```\n\n## Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the requests library structure with main code in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/`\n- **Key Files Identified**: `sessions.py` (contains the bug), `compat.py` (likely contains `builtin_str`)\n\n### 2. Bug Location Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Result**: Found the exact line 428 with `method = builtin_str(method)`\n- **Context**: Located within the `Session.request()` method that handles all HTTP requests\n\n### 3. Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Result**: Analyzed the surrounding code context (lines 360-449)\n- **Key Finding**: The converted method is used in `method.upper()` on line 432, which would fail with malformed method names\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located the exact bug in `sessions.py` line 428\n- Identified the root cause (Python version compatibility issue with `builtin_str()`)\n- Understood the code flow and impact\n\n### 🔄 Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine `builtin_str()` implementation** in `compat.py` to understand the version differences\n2. **Create a test case** to reproduce the bug with binary string methods\n3. **Implement the fix** - likely need to properly decode binary strings before using `builtin_str()`\n4. **Test the fix** across Python versions to ensure compatibility\n\n## Technical Decisions Needed\n\n### Fix Strategy Options\n1. **Replace `builtin_str(method)`** with a custom function that properly handles binary strings\n2. **Add preprocessing** to decode binary strings before calling `builtin_str()`\n3. **Use a different conversion approach** that's consistent across Python versions\n\n### Recommended Next Action\nExamine the `builtin_str()` function in `compat.py` to understand its implementation and determine the most appropriate fix strategy that maintains backward compatibility while resolving the Python 3.4 issue.\n\nThe bug is clearly identified and the fix location is known. The repair should be straightforward once the `builtin_str()` behavior is fully understood.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 380, \"end_line\": 430 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 671\nShowing lines 380-429:\n\n 380:         data=None,\n 381:         headers=None,\n 382:         cookies=None,\n 383:         files=None,\n 384:         auth=None,\n 385:         timeout=None,\n 386:         allow_redirects=True,\n 387:         proxies=None,\n 388:         hooks=None,\n 389:         stream=None,\n 390:         verify=None,\n 391:         cert=None,\n 392:         json=None):\n 393:         \"\"\"Constructs a :class:`Request <Request>`, prepares it and sends it.\n 394:         Returns :class:`Response <Response>` object.\n 395: \n 396:         :param method: method for the new :class:`Request` object.\n 397:         :param url: URL for the new :class:`Request` object.\n 398:         :param params: (optional) Dictionary or bytes to be sent in the query\n 399:             string for the :class:`Request`.\n 400:         :param data: (optional) Dictionary or bytes to send in the body of the\n 401:             :class:`Request`.\n 402:         :param json: (optional) json to send in the body of the\n 403:             :class:`Request`.\n 404:         :param headers: (optional) Dictionary of HTTP Headers to send with the\n 405:             :class:`Request`.\n 406:         :param cookies: (optional) Dict or CookieJar object to send with the\n 407:             :class:`Request`.\n 408:         :param files: (optional) Dictionary of ``'filename': file-like-objects``\n 409:             for multipart encoding upload.\n 410:         :param auth: (optional) Auth tuple or callable to enable\n 411:             Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP Auth.\n 412:         :param timeout: (optional) How long to wait for the server to send\n 413:             data before giving up, as a float, or a (`connect timeout, read\n 414:             timeout <user/advanced.html#timeouts>`_) tuple.\n 415:         :type timeout: float or tuple\n 416:         :param allow_redirects: (optional) Set to True by default.\n 417:         :type allow_redirects: bool\n 418:         :param proxies: (optional) Dictionary mapping protocol to the URL of\n 419:             the proxy.\n 420:         :param stream: (optional) whether to immediately download the response\n 421:             content.

What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb’GET’\nto\n\"b'GET’\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET’”, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: In Python 3, `builtin_str = str`, and when `str()` is called on a binary string like `b'GET'`, it returns the literal string representation `\"b'GET'\"` instead of decoding it to `'GET'`.\n\n2. **Python 2 vs 3 Difference**: \n   - Python 2.6: `builtin_str = str`, but `str(b'GET')` works correctly because bytes and strings are more interchangeable\n   - Python 3.4: `builtin_str = str`, but `str(b'GET')` returns `\"b'GET'\"` (the repr of the bytes object)\n\n3. **The Fix**: Instead of using `builtin_str(method)` which causes the problem, we need to properly handle binary strings by decoding them first.\n\nLooking at the imports, I see there's a `to_native_string` function imported from `.utils` which might be the proper way to handle this conversion. Let me examine that function.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"to_native_string\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\" }",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Bug Investigation and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the requests library where HTTP methods passed as binary strings (e.g., `b'GET'`) are incorrectly converted to literal string representations (`\"b'GET'\"`) instead of proper string values (`'GET'`), causing 404 errors.\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n### Bug Location and Root Cause\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py`\n- **Line**: 428 - `method = builtin_str(method)`\n- **Issue**: The `builtin_str()` function handles binary strings differently between Python versions:\n  - Python 2.6: Correctly converts `b'GET'` to `'GET'`\n  - Python 3.4: Incorrectly converts `b'GET'` to `\"b'GET'\"` (literal string representation)\n\n### Code Context\nThe problematic code is in the `Session.request()` method (lines 378-449):\n```python\ndef request(self, method, url, ...):\n    \"\"\"Constructs a Request, prepares it and sends it.\"\"\"\n    \n    method = builtin_str(method)  # Line 428 - THE BUG\n    \n    # Create the Request.\n    req = Request(\n        method = method.upper(),  # Line 432 - Uses the incorrectly converted method\n        url = url,\n        ...\n    )\n```\n\n## Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the requests library structure with main code in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/`\n- **Key Files Identified**: `sessions.py` (contains the bug), `compat.py` (likely contains `builtin_str`)\n\n### 2. Bug Location Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Result**: Found the exact line 428 with `method = builtin_str(method)`\n- **Context**: Located within the `Session.request()` method that handles all HTTP requests\n\n### 3. Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Result**: Analyzed the surrounding code context (lines 360-449)\n- **Key Finding**: The converted method is used in `method.upper()` on line 432, which would fail with malformed method names\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located the exact bug in `sessions.py` line 428\n- Identified the root cause (Python version compatibility issue with `builtin_str()`)\n- Understood the code flow and impact\n\n### 🔄 Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine `builtin_str()` implementation** in `compat.py` to understand the version differences\n2. **Create a test case** to reproduce the bug with binary string methods\n3. **Implement the fix** - likely need to properly decode binary strings before using `builtin_str()`\n4. **Test the fix** across Python versions to ensure compatibility\n\n## Technical Decisions Needed\n\n### Fix Strategy Options\n1. **Replace `builtin_str(method)`** with a custom function that properly handles binary strings\n2. **Add preprocessing** to decode binary strings before calling `builtin_str()`\n3. **Use a different conversion approach** that's consistent across Python versions\n\n### Recommended Next Action\nExamine the `builtin_str()` function in `compat.py` to understand its implementation and determine the most appropriate fix strategy that maintains backward compatibility while resolving the Python 3.4 issue.\n\nThe bug is clearly identified and the fix location is known. The repair should be straightforward once the `builtin_str()` behavior is fully understood.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 380, \"end_line\": 430 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 671\nShowing lines 380-429:\n\n 380:         data=None,\n 381:         headers=None,\n 382:         cookies=None,\n 383:         files=None,\n 384:         auth=None,\n 385:         timeout=None,\n 386:         allow_redirects=True,\n 387:         proxies=None,\n 388:         hooks=None,\n 389:         stream=None,\n 390:         verify=None,\n 391:         cert=None,\n 392:         json=None):\n 393:         \"\"\"Constructs a :class:`Request <Request>`, prepares it and sends it.\n 394:         Returns :class:`Response <Response>` object.\n 395: \n 396:         :param method: method for the new :class:`Request` object.\n 397:         :param url: URL for the new :class:`Request` object.\n 398:         :param params: (optional) Dictionary or bytes to be sent in the query\n 399:             string for the :class:`Request`.\n 400:         :param data: (optional) Dictionary or bytes to send in the body of the\n 401:             :class:`Request`.\n 402:         :param json: (optional) json to send in the body of the\n 403:             :class:`Request`.\n 404:         :param headers: (optional) Dictionary of HTTP Headers to send with the\n 405:             :class:`Request`.\n 406:         :param cookies: (optional) Dict or CookieJar object to send with the\n 407:             :class:`Request`.\n 408:         :param files: (optional) Dictionary of ``'filename': file-like-objects``\n 409:             for multipart encoding upload.\n 410:         :param auth: (optional) Auth tuple or callable to enable\n 411:             Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP Auth.\n 412:         :param timeout: (optional) How long to wait for the server to send\n 413:             data before giving up, as a float, or a (`connect timeout, read\n 414:             timeout <user/advanced.html#timeouts>`_) tuple.\n 415:         :type timeout: float or tuple\n 416:         :param allow_redirects: (optional) Set to True by default.\n 417:         :type allow_redirects: bool\n 418:         :param proxies: (optional) Dictionary mapping protocol to the URL of\n 419:             the proxy.\n 420:         :param stream: (optional) whether to immediately download the response\n 421:             content.

Let me examine that function.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"to_native_string\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'to_native_string' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\nLines 652-658:\n 652:     return auth\n 653: \n 654: \n 655: def to_native_string(string, encoding='ascii'):\n 656:     \"\"\"\n 657:     Given a string object, regardless of type, returns a representation of that\n 658:     string in the native string type, encoding and decoding where necessary.\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1.

What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb’GET’\nto\n\"b'GET’\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET’”, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n",

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Bug Investigation and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the requests library where HTTP methods passed as binary strings (e.g., `b'GET'`) are incorrectly converted to literal string representations (`\"b'GET'\"`) instead of proper string values (`'GET'`), causing 404 errors.\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n### Bug Location and Root Cause\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py`\n- **Line**: 428 - `method = builtin_str(method)`\n- **Issue**: The `builtin_str()` function handles binary strings differently between Python versions:\n  - Python 2.6: Correctly converts `b'GET'` to `'GET'`\n  - Python 3.4: Incorrectly converts `b'GET'` to `\"b'GET'\"` (literal string representation)\n\n### Code Context\nThe problematic code is in the `Session.request()` method (lines 378-449):\n```python\ndef request(self, method, url, ...):\n    \"\"\"Constructs a Request, prepares it and sends it.\"\"\"\n    \n    method = builtin_str(method)  # Line 428 - THE BUG\n    \n    # Create the Request.\n    req = Request(\n        method = method.upper(),  # Line 432 - Uses the incorrectly converted method\n        url = url,\n        ...\n    )\n```\n\n## Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the requests library structure with main code in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/`\n- **Key Files Identified**: `sessions.py` (contains the bug), `compat.py` (likely contains `builtin_str`)\n\n### 2. Bug Location Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Result**: Found the exact line 428 with `method = builtin_str(method)`\n- **Context**: Located within the `Session.request()` method that handles all HTTP requests\n\n### 3. Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Result**: Analyzed the surrounding code context (lines 360-449)\n- **Key Finding**: The converted method is used in `method.upper()` on line 432, which would fail with malformed method names\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located the exact bug in `sessions.py` line 428\n- Identified the root cause (Python version compatibility issue with `builtin_str()`)\n- Understood the code flow and impact\n\n### 🔄 Next Steps Required\n1. **Examine `builtin_str()` implementation** in `compat.py` to understand the version differences\n2. **Create a test case** to reproduce the bug with binary string methods\n3. **Implement the fix** - likely need to properly decode binary strings before using `builtin_str()`\n4. **Test the fix** across Python versions to ensure compatibility\n\n## Technical Decisions Needed\n\n### Fix Strategy Options\n1. **Replace `builtin_str(method)`** with a custom function that properly handles binary strings\n2. **Add preprocessing** to decode binary strings before calling `builtin_str()`\n3. **Use a different conversion approach** that's consistent across Python versions\n\n### Recommended Next Action\nExamine the `builtin_str()` function in `compat.py` to understand its implementation and determine the most appropriate fix strategy that maintains backward compatibility while resolving the Python 3.4 issue.\n\nThe bug is clearly identified and the fix location is known. The repair should be straightforward once the `builtin_str()` behavior is fully understood.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: #TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 380, \"end_line\": 430 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 671\nShowing lines 380-429:\n\n 380:         data=None,\n 381:         headers=None,\n 382:         cookies=None,\n 383:         files=None,\n 384:         auth=None,\n 385:         timeout=None,\n 386:         allow_redirects=True,\n 387:         proxies=None,\n 388:         hooks=None,\n 389:         stream=None,\n 390:         verify=None,\n 391:         cert=None,\n 392:         json=None):\n 393:         \"\"\"Constructs a :class:`Request <Request>`, prepares it and sends it.\n 394:         Returns :class:`Response <Response>` object.\n 395: \n 396:         :param method: method for the new :class:`Request` object.\n 397:         :param url: URL for the new :class:`Request` object.\n 398:         :param params: (optional) Dictionary or bytes to be sent in the query\n 399:             string for the :class:`Request`.\n 400:         :param data: (optional) Dictionary or bytes to send in the body of the\n 401:             :class:`Request`.\n 402:         :param json: (optional) json to send in the body of the\n 403:             :class:`Request`.\n 404:         :param headers: (optional) Dictionary of HTTP Headers to send with the\n 405:             :class:`Request`.\n 406:         :param cookies: (optional) Dict or CookieJar object to send with the\n 407:             :class:`Request`.\n 408:         :param files: (optional) Dictionary of ``'filename': file-like-objects``\n 409:             for multipart encoding upload.\n 410:         :param auth: (optional) Auth tuple or callable to enable\n 411:             Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP Auth.\n 412:         :param timeout: (optional) How long to wait for the server to send\n 413:             data before giving up, as a float, or a (`connect timeout, read\n 414:             timeout <user/advanced.html#timeouts>`_) tuple.\n 415:         :type timeout: float or tuple\n 416:         :param allow_redirects: (optional) Set to True by default.\n 417:         :type allow_redirects: bool\n 418:         :param proxies: (optional) Dictionary mapping protocol to the URL of\n 419:             the proxy.\n 420:         :param stream: (optional) whether to immediately download the response\n 421:             content.

    "response": "Perfect! Now I have all the information needed to identify the bug locations. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**Root Cause**: The `builtin_str()` function behaves differently between Python versions when handling binary strings:\n- Python 2.6: `str(b'GET')` correctly returns `'GET'`\n- Python 3.4: `str(b'GET')` returns `\"b'GET'\"` (the string representation of the bytes object)\n\n**The Problem**: In `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 428, `method = builtin_str(method)` converts binary method names incorrectly in Python 3.\n\n**The Solution**: The `to_native_string()` function in `utils.py` (lines 655-671) is specifically designed to handle this cross-version compatibility issue. It properly decodes binary strings in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility.\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\nBased on my analysis, here are the precise locations where the bug manifests and needs to be fixed:\n\n1. **Primary Bug Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 428\n   - This is where `method = builtin_str(method)` incorrectly converts binary strings\n\n2. **Related Impact Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 432\n   - This is where `method.upper()` is used with the incorrectly converted method string\n\n3. **Root Cause Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/compat.py` lines 96 and 111\n   - These define `builtin_str = str` for both Python versions, but the behavior differs\n\n4. **Solution Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py` lines 655-671\n   - The `to_native_string()` function that should be used instead of `builtin_str()`\n\n5. **Import Context**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 15\n   - Where `to_native_string` is imported and available for use\n\nThe fix is straightforward: replace `method = builtin_str(method)` on line 428 with `method = to_native_string(method)`. This will properly handle binary strings like `b'GET'` by decoding them to `'GET'` in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**",

Let me examine that function.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"to_native_string\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'to_native_string' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\nLines 652-658:\n 652:     return auth\n 653: \n 654: \n 655: def to_native_string(string, encoding='ascii'):\n 656:     \"\"\"\n 657:     Given a string object, regardless of type, returns a representation of that\n 658:     string in the native string type, encoding and decoding where necessary.\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\", \"start_line\": 655, \"end_line\": 680 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\nTotal lines: 686\nShowing lines 655-680:\n\n 655: def to_native_string(string, encoding='ascii'):\n 656:     \"\"\"\n 657:     Given a string object, regardless of type, returns a representation of that\n 658:     string in the native string type, encoding and decoding where necessary.\n 659:     This assumes ASCII unless told otherwise.\n 660:     \"\"\"\n 661:     out = None\n 662: \n 663:     if isinstance(string, builtin_str):\n 664:         out = string\n 665:     else:\n 666:         if is_py2:\n 667:             out = string.encode(encoding)\n 668:         else:\n 669:             out = string.decode(encoding)\n 670: \n 671:     return out\n 672: \n 673: \n 674: def urldefragauth(url):\n 675:     \"\"\"\n 676:     Given a url remove the fragment and the authentication part\n 677:     \"\"\"\n 678:     scheme, netloc, path, params, query, fragment = urlparse(url)\n 679: \n 680:     # see func:`prepend_scheme_if_needed`\n\nPerfect! Now I have all the information needed to identify the bug locations. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**Root Cause**: The `builtin_str()` function behaves differently between Python versions when handling binary strings:\n- Python 2.6: `str(b'GET')` correctly returns `'GET'`\n- Python 3.4: `str(b'GET')` returns `\"b'GET'\"` (the string representation of the bytes object)\n\n**The Problem**: In `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 428, `method = builtin_str(method)` converts binary method names incorrectly in Python 3.\n\n**The Solution**: The `to_native_string()` function in `utils.py` (lines 655-671) is specifically designed to handle this cross-version compatibility issue. It properly decodes binary strings in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility.\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\nBased on my analysis, here are the precise locations where the bug manifests and needs to be fixed:\n\n1. **Primary Bug Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 428\n   - This is where `method = builtin_str(method)` incorrectly converts binary strings\n\n2. **Related Impact Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 432\n   - This is where `method.upper()` is used with the incorrectly converted method string\n\n3. **Root Cause Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/compat.py` lines 96 and 111\n   - These define `builtin_str = str` for both Python versions, but the behavior differs\n\n4. **Solution Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py` lines 655-671\n   - The `to_native_string()` function that should be used instead of `builtin_str()`\n\n5. **Import Context**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 15\n   - Where `to_native_string` is imported and available for use\n\nThe fix is straightforward: replace `method = builtin_str(method)` on line 428 with `method = to_native_string(method)`. This will properly handle binary strings like `b'GET'` by decoding them to `'GET'` in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my thorough analysis of the bug where `builtin_str(method)` incorrectly converts binary strings like `b'GET'` to literal strings like `\"b'GET'\"` in Python 3.4, I have identified the key locations where this issue manifests and can be resolved.\n\nThe root cause is that `builtin_str()` behaves differently between Python versions when handling binary strings. In Python 3.4, `str(b'GET')` returns the string representation `\"b'GET'\"` instead of decoding it to `'GET'`. The solution exists in the codebase as the `to_native_string()` function which properly handles this cross-version compatibility.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 428,\n            \"end_line\": 428\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 432,\n            \"end_line\": 432\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/compat.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 96,\n            \"end_line\": 96\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/compat.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 111,\n            \"end_line\": 111\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 655,\n            \"end_line\": 671\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe problem statement the project is:\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb’GET’\nto\n\"b'GET’\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET’”, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n",

Let me examine that function.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"to_native_string\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'to_native_string' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\nLines 652-658:\n 652:     return auth\n 653: \n 654: \n 655: def to_native_string(string, encoding='ascii'):\n 656:     \"\"\"\n 657:     Given a string object, regardless of type, returns a representation of that\n 658:     string in the native string type, encoding and decoding where necessary.\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\", \"start_line\": 655, \"end_line\": 680 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\nTotal lines: 686\nShowing lines 655-680:\n\n 655: def to_native_string(string, encoding='ascii'):\n 656:     \"\"\"\n 657:     Given a string object, regardless of type, returns a representation of that\n 658:     string in the native string type, encoding and decoding where necessary.\n 659:     This assumes ASCII unless told otherwise.\n 660:     \"\"\"\n 661:     out = None\n 662: \n 663:     if isinstance(string, builtin_str):\n 664:         out = string\n 665:     else:\n 666:         if is_py2:\n 667:             out = string.encode(encoding)\n 668:         else:\n 669:             out = string.decode(encoding)\n 670: \n 671:     return out\n 672: \n 673: \n 674: def urldefragauth(url):\n 675:     \"\"\"\n 676:     Given a url remove the fragment and the authentication part\n 677:     \"\"\"\n 678:     scheme, netloc, path, params, query, fragment = urlparse(url)\n 679: \n 680:     # see func:`prepend_scheme_if_needed`\n\nPerfect! Now I have all the information needed to identify the bug locations. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**Root Cause**: The `builtin_str()` function behaves differently between Python versions when handling binary strings:\n- Python 2.6: `str(b'GET')` correctly returns `'GET'`\n- Python 3.4: `str(b'GET')` returns `\"b'GET'\"` (the string representation of the bytes object)\n\n**The Problem**: In `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 428, `method = builtin_str(method)` converts binary method names incorrectly in Python 3.\n\n**The Solution**: The `to_native_string()` function in `utils.py` (lines 655-671) is specifically designed to handle this cross-version compatibility issue. It properly decodes binary strings in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility.\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\nBased on my analysis, here are the precise locations where the bug manifests and needs to be fixed:\n\n1. **Primary Bug Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 428\n   - This is where `method = builtin_str(method)` incorrectly converts binary strings\n\n2. **Related Impact Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 432\n   - This is where `method.upper()` is used with the incorrectly converted method string\n\n3. **Root Cause Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/compat.py` lines 96 and 111\n   - These define `builtin_str = str` for both Python versions, but the behavior differs\n\n4. **Solution Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py` lines 655-671\n   - The `to_native_string()` function that should be used instead of `builtin_str()`\n\n5. **Import Context**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 15\n   - Where `to_native_string` is imported and available for use\n\nThe fix is straightforward: replace `method = builtin_str(method)` on line 428 with `method = to_native_string(method)`. This will properly handle binary strings like `b'GET'` by decoding them to `'GET'` in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my thorough analysis of the bug where `builtin_str(method)` incorrectly converts binary strings like `b'GET'` to literal strings like `\"b'GET'\"` in Python 3.4, I have identified the key locations where this issue manifests and can be resolved.\n\nThe root cause is that `builtin_str()` behaves differently between Python versions when handling binary strings. In Python 3.4, `str(b'GET')` returns the string representation `\"b'GET'\"` instead of decoding it to `'GET'`. The solution exists in the codebase as the `to_native_string()` function which properly handles this cross-version compatibility.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 428,\n            \"end_line\": 428\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 432,\n            \"end_line\": 432\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/compat.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 96,\n            \"end_line\": 96\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/compat.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 111,\n            \"end_line\": 111\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 655,\n            \"end_line\": 671\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The user has confirmed exactly what I discovered through my analysis:\n\n1. **The Bug**: `method = builtin_str(method)` in `sessions.py` line 428 converts `b'GET'` to `\"b'GET'\"` (literal string representation) instead of `'GET'` (decoded string)\n\n2. **The Impact**: This causes 404 errors when the HTTP method becomes `\"b'GET'\"` instead of `'GET'`\n\n3. **Python Version Difference**: Works in Python 2.6 but fails in Python 3.4 due to different `str()` behavior with bytes objects\n\n4. **External Context**: The issue is triggered by python-neutronclient which converts arguments to binary strings using `utils.safe_encode_list(args)`\n\n5. **The Solution**: Use `to_native_string()` instead of `builtin_str()` to properly handle binary string conversion\n\nThe locations I identified are correct, and I now understand how they interconnect:\n- Line 428: Primary bug location where incorrect conversion happens\n- Line 432: Where the incorrectly converted method is used\n- compat.py lines 96/111: Root cause of the version difference\n- utils.py lines 655-671: The proper solution function\n\nNow I can provide precise repair suggestions for each location.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **[sessions.py line 428]**: Replace `method = builtin_str(method)` with `method = to_native_string(method)`.

Let me examine that function.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"to_native_string\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'to_native_string' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\nLines 652-658:\n 652:     return auth\n 653: \n 654: \n 655: def to_native_string(string, encoding='ascii'):\n 656:     \"\"\"\n 657:     Given a string object, regardless of type, returns a representation of that\n 658:     string in the native string type, encoding and decoding where necessary.\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\", \"start_line\": 655, \"end_line\": 680 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\nTotal lines: 686\nShowing lines 655-680:\n\n 655: def to_native_string(string, encoding='ascii'):\n 656:     \"\"\"\n 657:     Given a string object, regardless of type, returns a representation of that\n 658:     string in the native string type, encoding and decoding where necessary.\n 659:     This assumes ASCII unless told otherwise.\n 660:     \"\"\"\n 661:     out = None\n 662: \n 663:     if isinstance(string, builtin_str):\n 664:         out = string\n 665:     else:\n 666:         if is_py2:\n 667:             out = string.encode(encoding)\n 668:         else:\n 669:             out = string.decode(encoding)\n 670: \n 671:     return out\n 672: \n 673: \n 674: def urldefragauth(url):\n 675:     \"\"\"\n 676:     Given a url remove the fragment and the authentication part\n 677:     \"\"\"\n 678:     scheme, netloc, path, params, query, fragment = urlparse(url)\n 679: \n 680:     # see func:`prepend_scheme_if_needed`\n\nPerfect! Now I have all the information needed to identify the bug locations. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**Root Cause**: The `builtin_str()` function behaves differently between Python versions when handling binary strings:\n- Python 2.6: `str(b'GET')` correctly returns `'GET'`\n- Python 3.4: `str(b'GET')` returns `\"b'GET'\"` (the string representation of the bytes object)\n\n**The Problem**: In `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 428, `method = builtin_str(method)` converts binary method names incorrectly in Python 3.\n\n**The Solution**: The `to_native_string()` function in `utils.py` (lines 655-671) is specifically designed to handle this cross-version compatibility issue. It properly decodes binary strings in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility.\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\nBased on my analysis, here are the precise locations where the bug manifests and needs to be fixed:\n\n1. **Primary Bug Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 428\n   - This is where `method = builtin_str(method)` incorrectly converts binary strings\n\n2. **Related Impact Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 432\n   - This is where `method.upper()` is used with the incorrectly converted method string\n\n3. **Root Cause Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/compat.py` lines 96 and 111\n   - These define `builtin_str = str` for both Python versions, but the behavior differs\n\n4. **Solution Location**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py` lines 655-671\n   - The `to_native_string()` function that should be used instead of `builtin_str()`\n\n5. **Import Context**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py` line 15\n   - Where `to_native_string` is imported and available for use\n\nThe fix is straightforward: replace `method = builtin_str(method)` on line 428 with `method = to_native_string(method)`. This will properly handle binary strings like `b'GET'` by decoding them to `'GET'` in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my thorough analysis of the bug where `builtin_str(method)` incorrectly converts binary strings like `b'GET'` to literal strings like `\"b'GET'\"` in Python 3.4, I have identified the key locations where this issue manifests and can be resolved.\n\nThe root cause is that `builtin_str()` behaves differently between Python versions when handling binary strings. In Python 3.4, `str(b'GET')` returns the string representation `\"b'GET'\"` instead of decoding it to `'GET'`. The solution exists in the codebase as the `to_native_string()` function which properly handles this cross-version compatibility.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 428,\n            \"end_line\": 428\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 432,\n            \"end_line\": 432\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/compat.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 96,\n            \"end_line\": 96\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/compat.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 111,\n            \"end_line\": 111\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/utils.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 655,\n            \"end_line\": 671\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The user has confirmed exactly what I discovered through my analysis:\n\n1. **The Bug**: `method = builtin_str(method)` in `sessions.py` line 428 converts `b'GET'` to `\"b'GET'\"` (literal string representation) instead of `'GET'` (decoded string)\n\n2. **The Impact**: This causes 404 errors when the HTTP method becomes `\"b'GET'\"` instead of `'GET'`\n\n3. **Python Version Difference**: Works in Python 2.6 but fails in Python 3.4 due to different `str()` behavior with bytes objects\n\n4. **External Context**: The issue is triggered by python-neutronclient which converts arguments to binary strings using `utils.safe_encode_list(args)`\n\n5. **The Solution**: Use `to_native_string()` instead of `builtin_str()` to properly handle binary string conversion\n\nThe locations I identified are correct, and I now understand how they interconnect:\n- Line 428: Primary bug location where incorrect conversion happens\n- Line 432: Where the incorrectly converted method is used\n- compat.py lines 96/111: Root cause of the version difference\n- utils.py lines 655-671: The proper solution function\n\nNow I can provide precise repair suggestions for each location.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **[sessions.py line 428]**: Replace `method = builtin_str(method)` with `method = to_native_string(method)`. This is the primary fix that will properly decode binary strings like `b'GET'` to `'GET'` in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility. The `to_native_string()` function is already imported and specifically designed for this cross-version string handling.\n\n2. **[sessions.py line 432]**: No change needed here - `method.upper()` will work correctly once line 428 is fixed, as it will receive the properly decoded string `'GET'` instead of the literal `\"b'GET'\"`.\n\n3. **[compat.py lines 96 and 111]**: No changes needed - these define `builtin_str = str` for both Python versions, which is correct for their intended use cases. The issue is not with `builtin_str` itself but with using it for binary string conversion where `to_native_string()` is more appropriate.\n\n4. **[utils.py lines 655-671]**: No changes needed - the `to_native_string()` function is already correctly implemented and handles the binary-to-string conversion properly across Python versions by using `string.decode(encoding)` in Python 3 and `string.encode(encoding)` in Python 2.\n\nThe fix is a simple one-line change that leverages existing, purpose-built functionality.

This is the primary fix that will properly decode binary strings like `b'GET'` to `'GET'` in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility. The `to_native_string()` function is already imported and specifically designed for this cross-version string handling.\n\n2. **[sessions.py line 432]**: No change needed here - `method.upper()` will work correctly once line 428 is fixed, as it will receive the properly decoded string `'GET'` instead of the literal `\"b'GET'\"`.\n\n3. **[compat.py lines 96 and 111]**: No changes needed - these define `builtin_str = str` for both Python versions, which is correct for their intended use cases. The issue is not with `builtin_str` itself but with using it for binary string conversion where `to_native_string()` is more appropriate.\n\n4. **[utils.py lines 655-671]**: No changes needed - the `to_native_string()` function is already correctly implemented and handles the binary-to-string conversion properly across Python versions by using `string.decode(encoding)` in Python 3 and `string.encode(encoding)` in Python 2.\n\nThe fix is a simple one-line change that leverages existing, purpose-built functionality.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET’”, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there.

Now I have the complete context.

This is the primary fix that will properly decode binary strings like `b'GET'` to `'GET'` in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility. The `to_native_string()` function is already imported and specifically designed for this cross-version string handling.\n\n2. **[sessions.py line 432]**: No change needed here - `method.upper()` will work correctly once line 428 is fixed, as it will receive the properly decoded string `'GET'` instead of the literal `\"b'GET'\"`.\n\n3. **[compat.py lines 96 and 111]**: No changes needed - these define `builtin_str = str` for both Python versions, which is correct for their intended use cases. The issue is not with `builtin_str` itself but with using it for binary string conversion where `to_native_string()` is more appropriate.\n\n4. **[utils.py lines 655-671]**: No changes needed - the `to_native_string()` function is already correctly implemented and handles the binary-to-string conversion properly across Python versions by using `string.decode(encoding)` in Python 3 and `string.encode(encoding)` in Python 2.\n\nThe fix is a simple one-line change that leverages existing, purpose-built functionality.

This is the primary fix that will properly decode binary strings like `b'GET'` to `'GET'` in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility. The `to_native_string()` function is already imported and specifically designed for this cross-version string handling.\n\n2. **[sessions.py line 432]**: No change needed here - `method.upper()` will work correctly once line 428 is fixed, as it will receive the properly decoded string `'GET'` instead of the literal `\"b'GET'\"`.\n\n3. **[compat.py lines 96 and 111]**: No changes needed - these define `builtin_str = str` for both Python versions, which is correct for their intended use cases.

The `to_native_string()` function is already imported and specifically designed for this cross-version string handling.\n\n2. **[sessions.py line 432]**: No change needed here - `method.upper()` will work correctly once line 428 is fixed, as it will receive the properly decoded string `'GET'` instead of the literal `\"b'GET'\"`.\n\n3. **[compat.py lines 96 and 111]**: No changes needed - these define `builtin_str = str` for both Python versions, which is correct for their intended use cases. The issue is not with `builtin_str` itself but with using it for binary string conversion where `to_native_string()` is more appropriate.\n\n4. **[utils.py lines 655-671]**: No changes needed - the `to_native_string()` function is already correctly implemented and handles the binary-to-string conversion properly across Python versions by using `string.decode(encoding)` in Python 3 and `string.encode(encoding)` in Python 2.\n\nThe fix is a simple one-line change that leverages existing, purpose-built functionality.

This is the primary fix that will properly decode binary strings like `b'GET'` to `'GET'` in Python 3 while maintaining Python 2 compatibility. The `to_native_string()` function is already imported and specifically designed for this cross-version string handling.\n\n2. **[sessions.py line 432]**: No change needed here - `method.upper()` will work correctly once line 428 is fixed, as it will receive the properly decoded string `'GET'` instead of the literal `\"b'GET'\"`.\n\n3. **[compat.py lines 96 and 111]**: No changes needed - these define `builtin_str = str` for both Python versions, which is correct for their intended use cases. The issue is not with `builtin_str` itself but with using it for binary string conversion where `to_native_string()` is more appropriate.\n\n4. **[utils.py lines 655-671]**: No changes needed - the `to_native_string()` function is already correctly implemented and handles the binary-to-string conversion properly across Python versions by using `string.decode(encoding)` in Python 3 and `string.encode(encoding)` in Python 2.\n\nThe fix is a simple one-line change that leverages existing, purpose-built functionality.
