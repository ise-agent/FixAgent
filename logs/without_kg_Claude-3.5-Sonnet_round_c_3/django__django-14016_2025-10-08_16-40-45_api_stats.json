The problem is that while creating a Q object with dict_keys works fine, combining it with another Q object using the | operator fails due to pickling issues.\n\nLet me start by exploring the Django project structure to understand where Q objects are implemented.\n\n#TOOL_CALL explore_directory { \"dir_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/django\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nContents of /root/hy/projects_3/django:\n.editorconfig\n.eslintignore\n.eslintrc\n.gitattributes\n.github/\n.gitignore\n.pre-commit-config.yaml\n.tx/\nAUTHORS\nCONTRIBUTING.rst\nGruntfile.js\nINSTALL\nLICENSE\nLICENSE.python\nMANIFEST.in\nREADME.rst\ndjango/\ndocs/\nextras/\njs_tests/\npackage.json\npyproject.toml\nscripts/\nsetup.cfg\nsetup.py\ntests/\ntox.ini\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I understand the project structure. The issue is with Q objects in Django's ORM.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Bug Investigation Summary: Django Q Object TypeError with Non-Pickleable Types\n\n## Main Objective\nInvestigate and repair a bug in Django's Q object implementation where using the `|` (OR) operator with Q objects containing non-pickleable types (like `dict_keys`) causes a `TypeError` during the pickling process.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: Django project structure (`/root/hy/projects_3/django`)\n- **Result**: Located the main Django codebase and identified the `django/db/models/` directory as the likely location for Q object implementation\n\n### 2. Q Object Implementation Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Q class is defined starting at line 29\n  - Q inherits from `tree.Node` (imported from `django.utils.tree`)\n  - The `|` operator is implemented via `__or__` method (line 60) which calls `_combine(other, self.OR)`\n  - The `_combine` method uses `copy.deepcopy()` on lines 49 and 52\n\n### 3. Root Cause Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**: \n  - The `Node` class implements `__deepcopy__` method (line 50-54)\n  - Line 53: `obj.children = copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)` is the problematic line\n  - This attempts to deep copy all children, including non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys`\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug occurs in the interaction between:\n1. **Q._combine()** method in `query_utils.py` (lines 49, 52) - calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n2. **Node.__deepcopy__()** method in `tree.py` (line 53) - attempts to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\n### Problem Flow\n1. User creates Q object with `dict_keys`: `Q(field__in=some_dict.keys())` ✅ Works\n2. User combines with another Q using `|`: `q1 | q2` ❌ Fails\n3. `__or__` calls `_combine()` which calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n4. `__deepcopy__` tries to pickle `dict_keys` object, causing TypeError\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Root cause identified\n- ✅ **Completed**: Exact bug location pinpointed\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Need to examine the complete `add` method in tree.py (lines 78-99+ not fully read)\n- ❌ **Pending**: Solution implementation\n- ❌ **Pending**: Testing the fix\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete tree.py analysis**: Read the full `add` method implementation to understand all code paths\n2. **Develop fix strategy**: Likely need to modify the deepcopy behavior to handle non-pickleable objects gracefully\n3. **Implement solution**: Modify either `__deepcopy__` in Node class or `_combine` in Q class\n4. **Create test case**: Reproduce the bug and verify the fix works\n5. **Test edge cases**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Important Technical Details\n- **File Locations**:\n  - Q class: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py:29`\n  - Node class: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py:11`\n- **Key Methods**: `Q._combine()`, `Q.__or__()`, `Node.__deepcopy__()`\n- **Error Context**: The issue only occurs when combining Q objects, not when creating them initially\n- **Inheritance Chain**: Q → tree.Node → object\n\nThis investigation has successfully identified the root cause and exact location of the bug, setting up the foundation for implementing an effective fix.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the issue better.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: Django project structure (`/root/hy/projects_3/django`)\n- **Result**: Located the main Django codebase and identified the `django/db/models/` directory as the likely location for Q object implementation\n\n### 2. Q Object Implementation Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Q class is defined starting at line 29\n  - Q inherits from `tree.Node` (imported from `django.utils.tree`)\n  - The `|` operator is implemented via `__or__` method (line 60) which calls `_combine(other, self.OR)`\n  - The `_combine` method uses `copy.deepcopy()` on lines 49 and 52\n\n### 3. Root Cause Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**: \n  - The `Node` class implements `__deepcopy__` method (line 50-54)\n  - Line 53: `obj.children = copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)` is the problematic line\n  - This attempts to deep copy all children, including non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys`\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug occurs in the interaction between:\n1. **Q._combine()** method in `query_utils.py` (lines 49, 52) - calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n2. **Node.__deepcopy__()** method in `tree.py` (line 53) - attempts to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\n### Problem Flow\n1. User creates Q object with `dict_keys`: `Q(field__in=some_dict.keys())` ✅ Works\n2.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Bug Investigation Summary: Django Q Object TypeError with Non-Pickleable Types\n\n## Main Objective\nInvestigate and repair a bug in Django's Q object implementation where using the `|` (OR) operator with Q objects containing non-pickleable types (like `dict_keys`) causes a `TypeError` during the pickling process.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: Django project structure (`/root/hy/projects_3/django`)\n- **Result**: Located the main Django codebase and identified the `django/db/models/` directory as the likely location for Q object implementation\n\n### 2. Q Object Implementation Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Q class is defined starting at line 29\n  - Q inherits from `tree.Node` (imported from `django.utils.tree`)\n  - The `|` operator is implemented via `__or__` method (line 60) which calls `_combine(other, self.OR)`\n  - The `_combine` method uses `copy.deepcopy()` on lines 49 and 52\n\n### 3. Root Cause Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**: \n  - The `Node` class implements `__deepcopy__` method (line 50-54)\n  - Line 53: `obj.children = copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)` is the problematic line\n  - This attempts to deep copy all children, including non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys`\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug occurs in the interaction between:\n1. **Q._combine()** method in `query_utils.py` (lines 49, 52) - calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n2. **Node.__deepcopy__()** method in `tree.py` (line 53) - attempts to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\n### Problem Flow\n1. User creates Q object with `dict_keys`: `Q(field__in=some_dict.keys())` ✅ Works\n2. User combines with another Q using `|`: `q1 | q2` ❌ Fails\n3. `__or__` calls `_combine()` which calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n4. `__deepcopy__` tries to pickle `dict_keys` object, causing TypeError\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Root cause identified\n- ✅ **Completed**: Exact bug location pinpointed\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Need to examine the complete `add` method in tree.py (lines 78-99+ not fully read)\n- ❌ **Pending**: Solution implementation\n- ❌ **Pending**: Testing the fix\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete tree.py analysis**: Read the full `add` method implementation to understand all code paths\n2. **Develop fix strategy**: Likely need to modify the deepcopy behavior to handle non-pickleable objects gracefully\n3. **Implement solution**: Modify either `__deepcopy__` in Node class or `_combine` in Q class\n4. **Create test case**: Reproduce the bug and verify the fix works\n5. **Test edge cases**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Important Technical Details\n- **File Locations**:\n  - Q class: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py:29`\n  - Node class: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py:11`\n- **Key Methods**: `Q._combine()`, `Q.__or__()`, `Node.__deepcopy__()`\n- **Error Context**: The issue only occurs when combining Q objects, not when creating them initially\n- **Inheritance Chain**: Q → tree.Node → object\n\nThis investigation has successfully identified the root cause and exact location of the bug, setting up the foundation for implementing an effective fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py\nStart line: 48\nEnd line: 52\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py\nStart line: 50\nEnd line: 54\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the issue better. The problem is in the `_combine` method which uses `copy.deepcopy()` on lines 49 and 52. When a Q object contains non-pickleable objects like dict_keys, the deepcopy operation fails because it tries to pickle the object.\n\nLet me examine the tree.Node class that Q inherits from to understand the full picture, particularly the `add` method used in `_combine`.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py\nTotal lines: 124\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: \"\"\"\n   2: A class for storing a tree graph.

The bug happens when using the `|` operator on Q objects containing non-pickleable types like `dict_keys`, causing a failure during the `copy.deepcopy()` operation.\n\nThe root cause is that the `_combine` method calls `copy.deepcopy()` which eventually invokes the `Node.__deepcopy__()` method that tries to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 48,\n            \"end_line\": 52\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 50,\n            \"end_line\": 54\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThese two locations are functionally connected:\n1. **Location 1** (lines 48-52): The `_combine` method in Q class where `copy.deepcopy()` is called on lines 49 and 52\n2. **Location 2** (lines 50-54): The `__deepcopy__` method in Node class where the actual failure occurs on line 53 when trying to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\nThe fix should handle non-pickleable objects gracefully during the deepcopy operation while preserving the logical functionality of Q object combination.\nThe problem statement the project is:\n\"TypeError: cannot pickle\" when applying | operator to a Q object\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Daniel Izquierdo)\n\t \nUsing a reference to a non-pickleable type of object such as dict_keys in a Q object makes the | operator fail:\n>>> from django.db.models import Q\n>>> Q(x__in={}.keys())\n<Q: (AND: ('x__in', dict_keys([])))>\n>>> Q() | Q(x__in={}.keys())\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n...\nTypeError: cannot pickle 'dict_keys' object\nEven though this particular example could be solved by doing Q() | Q(x__in={}) it still feels like using .keys() should work.\nI can work on a patch if there's agreement that this should not crash.\n",

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: Django project structure (`/root/hy/projects_3/django`)\n- **Result**: Located the main Django codebase and identified the `django/db/models/` directory as the likely location for Q object implementation\n\n### 2. Q Object Implementation Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Q class is defined starting at line 29\n  - Q inherits from `tree.Node` (imported from `django.utils.tree`)\n  - The `|` operator is implemented via `__or__` method (line 60) which calls `_combine(other, self.OR)`\n  - The `_combine` method uses `copy.deepcopy()` on lines 49 and 52\n\n### 3. Root Cause Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**: \n  - The `Node` class implements `__deepcopy__` method (line 50-54)\n  - Line 53: `obj.children = copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)` is the problematic line\n  - This attempts to deep copy all children, including non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys`\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug occurs in the interaction between:\n1. **Q._combine()** method in `query_utils.py` (lines 49, 52) - calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n2. **Node.__deepcopy__()** method in `tree.py` (line 53) - attempts to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\n### Problem Flow\n1. User creates Q object with `dict_keys`: `Q(field__in=some_dict.keys())` ✅ Works\n2. User combines with another Q using `|`: `q1 | q2` ❌ Fails\n3. `__or__` calls `_combine()` which calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n4. `__deepcopy__` tries to pickle `dict_keys` object, causing TypeError\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Root cause identified\n- ✅ **Completed**: Exact bug location pinpointed\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Need to examine the complete `add` method in tree.py (lines 78-99+ not fully read)\n- ❌ **Pending**: Solution implementation\n- ❌ **Pending**: Testing the fix\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete tree.py analysis**: Read the full `add` method implementation to understand all code paths\n2. **Develop fix strategy**: Likely need to modify the deepcopy behavior to handle non-pickleable objects gracefully\n3. **Implement solution**: Modify either `__deepcopy__` in Node class or `_combine` in Q class\n4. **Create test case**: Reproduce the bug and verify the fix works\n5. **Test edge cases**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Important Technical Details\n- **File Locations**:\n  - Q class: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py:29`\n  - Node class: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py:11`\n- **Key Methods**: `Q._combine()`, `Q.__or__()`, `Node.__deepcopy__()`\n- **Error Context**: The issue only occurs when combining Q objects, not when creating them initially\n- **Inheritance Chain**: Q → tree.Node → object\n\nThis investigation has successfully identified the root cause and exact location of the bug, setting up the foundation for implementing an effective fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py\nStart line: 48\nEnd line: 52\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py\nStart line: 50\nEnd line: 54\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context.

The bug happens when using the `|` operator on Q objects containing non-pickleable types like `dict_keys`, causing a failure during the `copy.deepcopy()` operation.\n\nThe root cause is that the `_combine` method calls `copy.deepcopy()` which eventually invokes the `Node.__deepcopy__()` method that tries to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 48,\n            \"end_line\": 52\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 50,\n            \"end_line\": 54\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThese two locations are functionally connected:\n1. **Location 1** (lines 48-52): The `_combine` method in Q class where `copy.deepcopy()` is called on lines 49 and 52\n2. **Location 2** (lines 50-54): The `__deepcopy__` method in Node class where the actual failure occurs on line 53 when trying to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\nThe fix should handle non-pickleable objects gracefully during the deepcopy operation while preserving the logical functionality of Q object combination.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context. The problem is exactly as I analyzed - when using the `|` operator on Q objects containing non-pickleable types like `dict_keys`, the `copy.deepcopy()` operation in the `_combine` method fails because it cannot pickle the `dict_keys` object.\n\nThe issue occurs in two interconnected locations:\n1.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: Django project structure (`/root/hy/projects_3/django`)\n- **Result**: Located the main Django codebase and identified the `django/db/models/` directory as the likely location for Q object implementation\n\n### 2. Q Object Implementation Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Q class is defined starting at line 29\n  - Q inherits from `tree.Node` (imported from `django.utils.tree`)\n  - The `|` operator is implemented via `__or__` method (line 60) which calls `_combine(other, self.OR)`\n  - The `_combine` method uses `copy.deepcopy()` on lines 49 and 52\n\n### 3. Root Cause Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**: \n  - The `Node` class implements `__deepcopy__` method (line 50-54)\n  - Line 53: `obj.children = copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)` is the problematic line\n  - This attempts to deep copy all children, including non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys`\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug occurs in the interaction between:\n1. **Q._combine()** method in `query_utils.py` (lines 49, 52) - calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n2. **Node.__deepcopy__()** method in `tree.py` (line 53) - attempts to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\n### Problem Flow\n1. User creates Q object with `dict_keys`: `Q(field__in=some_dict.keys())` ✅ Works\n2. User combines with another Q using `|`: `q1 | q2` ❌ Fails\n3. `__or__` calls `_combine()` which calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n4. `__deepcopy__` tries to pickle `dict_keys` object, causing TypeError\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Root cause identified\n- ✅ **Completed**: Exact bug location pinpointed\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Need to examine the complete `add` method in tree.py (lines 78-99+ not fully read)\n- ❌ **Pending**: Solution implementation\n- ❌ **Pending**: Testing the fix\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete tree.py analysis**: Read the full `add` method implementation to understand all code paths\n2. **Develop fix strategy**: Likely need to modify the deepcopy behavior to handle non-pickleable objects gracefully\n3. **Implement solution**: Modify either `__deepcopy__` in Node class or `_combine` in Q class\n4. **Create test case**: Reproduce the bug and verify the fix works\n5. **Test edge cases**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Important Technical Details\n- **File Locations**:\n  - Q class: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py:29`\n  - Node class: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py:11`\n- **Key Methods**: `Q._combine()`, `Q.__or__()`, `Node.__deepcopy__()`\n- **Error Context**: The issue only occurs when combining Q objects, not when creating them initially\n- **Inheritance Chain**: Q → tree.Node → object\n\nThis investigation has successfully identified the root cause and exact location of the bug, setting up the foundation for implementing an effective fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py\nStart line: 48\nEnd line: 52\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py\nStart line: 50\nEnd line: 54\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context.

A Q object contains non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys` in its children\n2. The `|` operator calls `_combine()` method\n3. `_combine()` calls `copy.deepcopy()` on lines 49 or 52\n4. `copy.deepcopy()` invokes `Node.__deepcopy__()`\n5. Line 53 in `__deepcopy__` tries to deep copy children containing `dict_keys`\n6. Python's pickle module cannot serialize `dict_keys`, causing TypeError\n\nThe fix should handle non-pickleable objects gracefully during the deepcopy operation while preserving the logical functionality of Q object combination.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my thorough analysis of the Django Q object TypeError bug, I have identified the precise locations where the issue occurs. The bug happens when using the `|` operator on Q objects containing non-pickleable types like `dict_keys`, causing a failure during the `copy.deepcopy()` operation.\n\nThe root cause is that the `_combine` method calls `copy.deepcopy()` which eventually invokes the `Node.__deepcopy__()` method that tries to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 48,\n            \"end_line\": 52\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 50,\n            \"end_line\": 54\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThese two locations are functionally connected:\n1. **Location 1** (lines 48-52): The `_combine` method in Q class where `copy.deepcopy()` is called on lines 49 and 52\n2. **Location 2** (lines 50-54): The `__deepcopy__` method in Node class where the actual failure occurs on line 53 when trying to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\nThe fix should handle non-pickleable objects gracefully during the deepcopy operation while preserving the logical functionality of Q object combination.\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context. The problem is exactly as I analyzed - when using the `|` operator on Q objects containing non-pickleable types like `dict_keys`, the `copy.deepcopy()` operation in the `_combine` method fails because it cannot pickle the `dict_keys` object.\n\nThe issue occurs in two interconnected locations:\n1. The `_combine` method calls `copy.deepcopy()` \n2. The `__deepcopy__` method tries to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\nLet me propose specific repair suggestions for both locations.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py, lines 48-52]**: Modify the `_combine` method to handle non-pickleable objects gracefully by implementing a custom copy mechanism instead of relying on `copy.deepcopy()`. Replace the deepcopy calls on lines 49 and 52 with a method that can handle non-pickleable objects by converting them to pickleable equivalents (e.g., convert `dict_keys` to `list`) before copying.\n\n2. **[/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py, lines 50-54]**: Enhance the `__deepcopy__` method in the Node class to handle non-pickleable objects in the children list. On line 53, implement a try-catch mechanism that attempts the normal `copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)` first, and if it fails with a TypeError related to pickling, fall back to a custom copying approach that converts non-pickleable objects to their pickleable equivalents while preserving the logical meaning.\n\nThe two fixes work together: Location 1 provides the entry point where the deepcopy is initiated, while Location 2 provides the robust fallback mechanism that ensures the copy operation succeeds even with non-pickleable objects. This approach maintains backward compatibility while extending support for non-pickleable types in Q objects.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py lines 48-52\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        if not other:\n            return copy.deepcopy(self)\n        # Or if this Q is empty, ignore it and just use `other`.\n        elif not self:\n            return copy.deepcopy(other)\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py lines 50-54\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def __deepcopy__(self, memodict):\n        obj = Node(connector=self.connector, negated=self.negated)\n        obj.__class__ = self.__class__\n        obj.children = copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)\n        return obj\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n#REFLECT\nLooking at the code segments and the problem statement, I can see that these are indeed the exact locations where the bug occurs. The issue is clear:\n\n1. **Location 1**: Lines 49 and 52 call `copy.deepcopy()` directly on Q objects that may contain non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys`\n2. **Location 2**: Line 53 in `__deepcopy__` method tries to deep copy the children list, which fails when it contains non-pickleable objects\n\nThe problem statement confirms this is exactly the issue - using `Q() | Q(x__in={}.keys())` fails because the `|` operator triggers the `_combine` method which calls `copy.deepcopy()`, leading to the pickle error.\n\nBoth locations are clearly identified and ready for fixing.

The problem is exactly as I analyzed - when using the `|` operator on Q objects containing non-pickleable types like `dict_keys`, the `copy.deepcopy()` operation in the `_combine` method fails because it cannot pickle the `dict_keys` object.\n\nThe issue occurs in two interconnected locations:\n1. The `_combine` method calls `copy.deepcopy()` \n2. The `__deepcopy__` method tries to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\nLet me propose specific repair suggestions for both locations.\n\nS\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py, lines 48-52]**: Modify the `_combine` method to handle non-pickleable objects gracefully by implementing a custom copy mechanism instead of relying on `copy.deepcopy()`. Replace the deepcopy calls on lines 49 and 52 with a method that can handle non-pickleable objects by converting them to pickleable equivalents (e.g., convert `dict_keys` to `list`) before copying.\n\n2. **[/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py, lines 50-54]**: Enhance the `__deepcopy__` method in the Node class to handle non-pickleable objects in the children list. On line 53, implement a try-catch mechanism that attempts the normal `copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)` first, and if it fails with a TypeError related to pickling, fall back to a custom copying approach that converts non-pickleable objects to their pickleable equivalents while preserving the logical meaning.\n\nThe two fixes work together: Location 1 provides the entry point where the deepcopy is initiated, while Location 2 provides the robust fallback mechanism that ensures the copy operation succeeds even with non-pickleable objects. This approach maintains backward compatibility while extending support for non-pickleable types in Q objects.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Bug Investigation Summary: Django Q Object TypeError with Non-Pickleable Types\n\n## Main Objective\nInvestigate and repair a bug in Django's Q object implementation where using the `|` (OR) operator with Q objects containing non-pickleable types (like `dict_keys`) causes a `TypeError` during the pickling process.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: Django project structure (`/root/hy/projects_3/django`)\n- **Result**: Located the main Django codebase and identified the `django/db/models/` directory as the likely location for Q object implementation\n\n### 2. Q Object Implementation Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Q class is defined starting at line 29\n  - Q inherits from `tree.Node` (imported from `django.utils.tree`)\n  - The `|` operator is implemented via `__or__` method (line 60) which calls `_combine(other, self.OR)`\n  - The `_combine` method uses `copy.deepcopy()` on lines 49 and 52\n\n### 3. Root Cause Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**: \n  - The `Node` class implements `__deepcopy__` method (line 50-54)\n  - Line 53: `obj.children = copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)` is the problematic line\n  - This attempts to deep copy all children, including non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys`\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug occurs in the interaction between:\n1. **Q._combine()** method in `query_utils.py` (lines 49, 52) - calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n2. **Node.__deepcopy__()** method in `tree.py` (line 53) - attempts to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\n### Problem Flow\n1. User creates Q object with `dict_keys`: `Q(field__in=some_dict.keys())` ✅ Works\n2. User combines with another Q using `|`: `q1 | q2` ❌ Fails\n3. `__or__` calls `_combine()` which calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n4. `__deepcopy__` tries to pickle `dict_keys` object, causing TypeError\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Root cause identified\n- ✅ **Completed**: Exact bug location pinpointed\n- 🔄 **In Progress**: Need to examine the complete `add` method in tree.py (lines 78-99+ not fully read)\n- ❌ **Pending**: Solution implementation\n- ❌ **Pending**: Testing the fix\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Complete tree.py analysis**: Read the full `add` method implementation to understand all code paths\n2. **Develop fix strategy**: Likely need to modify the deepcopy behavior to handle non-pickleable objects gracefully\n3. **Implement solution**: Modify either `__deepcopy__` in Node class or `_combine` in Q class\n4. **Create test case**: Reproduce the bug and verify the fix works\n5. **Test edge cases**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Important Technical Details\n- **File Locations**:\n  - Q class: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py:29`\n  - Node class: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py:11`\n- **Key Methods**: `Q._combine()`, `Q.__or__()`, `Node.__deepcopy__()`\n- **Error Context**: The issue only occurs when combining Q objects, not when creating them initially\n- **Inheritance Chain**: Q → tree.Node → object\n\nThis investigation has successfully identified the root cause and exact location of the bug, setting up the foundation for implementing an effective fix.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I understand the issue better. The problem is in the `_combine` method which uses `copy.deepcopy()` on lines 49 and 52. When a Q object contains non-pickleable objects like dict_keys, the deepcopy operation fails because it tries to pickle the object.\n\nLet me examine the tree.Node class that Q inherits from to understand the full picture, particularly the `add` method used in `_combine`.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py\nTotal lines: 124\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: \"\"\"\n   2: A class for storing a tree graph.

Line 53 in `__deepcopy__` tries to deep copy children containing `dict_keys`\n6. Python's pickle module cannot serialize `dict_keys`, causing TypeError\n\nThe fix should handle non-pickleable objects gracefully during the deepcopy operation while preserving the logical functionality of Q object combination.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: **PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my thorough analysis of the Django Q object TypeError bug, I have identified the precise locations where the issue occurs. The bug happens when using the `|` operator on Q objects containing non-pickleable types like `dict_keys`, causing a failure during the `copy.deepcopy()` operation.\n\nThe root cause is that the `_combine` method calls `copy.deepcopy()` which eventually invokes the `Node.__deepcopy__()` method that tries to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 48,\n            \"end_line\": 52\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 50,\n            \"end_line\": 54\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThese two locations are functionally connected:\n1. **Location 1** (lines 48-52): The `_combine` method in Q class where `copy.deepcopy()` is called on lines 49 and 52\n2. **Location 2** (lines 50-54): The `__deepcopy__` method in Node class where the actual failure occurs on line 53 when trying to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\nThe fix should handle non-pickleable objects gracefully during the deepcopy operation while preserving the logical functionality of Q object combination.\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context. The problem is exactly as I analyzed - when using the `|` operator on Q objects containing non-pickleable types like `dict_keys`, the `copy.deepcopy()` operation in the `_combine` method fails because it cannot pickle the `dict_keys` object.\n\nThe issue occurs in two interconnected locations:\n1. The `_combine` method calls `copy.deepcopy()` \n2. The `__deepcopy__` method tries to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\nLet me propose specific repair suggestions for both locations.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py, lines 48-52]**: Modify the `_combine` method to handle non-pickleable objects gracefully by implementing a custom copy mechanism instead of relying on `copy.deepcopy()`. Replace the deepcopy calls on lines 49 and 52 with a method that can handle non-pickleable objects by converting them to pickleable equivalents (e.g., convert `dict_keys` to `list`) before copying.\n\n2. **[/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py, lines 50-54]**: Enhance the `__deepcopy__` method in the Node class to handle non-pickleable objects in the children list. On line 53, implement a try-catch mechanism that attempts the normal `copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)` first, and if it fails with a TypeError related to pickling, fall back to a custom copying approach that converts non-pickleable objects to their pickleable equivalents while preserving the logical meaning.\n\nThe two fixes work together: Location 1 provides the entry point where the deepcopy is initiated, while Location 2 provides the robust fallback mechanism that ensures the copy operation succeeds even with non-pickleable objects. This approach maintains backward compatibility while extending support for non-pickleable types in Q objects.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py lines 48-52\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        if not other:\n            return copy.deepcopy(self)\n        # Or if this Q is empty, ignore it and just use `other`.\n        elif not self:\n            return copy.deepcopy(other)\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py lines 50-54\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def __deepcopy__(self, memodict):\n        obj = Node(connector=self.connector, negated=self.negated)\n        obj.__class__ = self.__class__\n        obj.children = copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)\n        return obj\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nLooking at the code segments and the problem statement, I can see that these are indeed the exact locations where the bug occurs. The issue is clear:\n\n1. **Location 1**: Lines 49 and 52 call `copy.deepcopy()` directly on Q objects that may contain non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys`\n2. **Location 2**: Line 53 in `__deepcopy__` method tries to deep copy the children list, which fails when it contains non-pickleable objects\n\nThe problem statement confirms this is exactly the issue - using `Q() | Q(x__in={}.keys())` fails because the `|` operator triggers the `_combine` method which calls `copy.deepcopy()`, leading to the pickle error.\n\nBoth locations are clearly identified and ready for fixing. The fix strategy should handle non-pickleable objects gracefully while preserving the logical functionality.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThese locations are ready for fixing. The code segments clearly show:\n\n1. **Location 1** (lines 48-52): The `_combine` method calls `copy.deepcopy(self)` on line 49 and `copy.deepcopy(other)` on line 52, which are the direct triggers of the bug when Q objects contain non-pickleable types like `dict_keys`.\n\n2. **Location 2** (lines 50-54): The `__deepcopy__` method attempts `copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)` on line 53, which is where the actual TypeError occurs when trying to pickle non-pickleable objects.\n\nThe problem statement confirms this exact scenario: `Q() | Q(x__in={}.keys())` fails with \"TypeError: cannot pickle 'dict_keys' object\" because the `|` operator calls `_combine()` which uses `copy.deepcopy()`.\n\nThe fix should implement a fallback mechanism that converts non-pickleable objects to their pickleable equivalents (e.g., `dict_keys` to `list`) while preserving the logical meaning of the Q object operations.\nUser: [Location 1] /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py lines 48-52\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import copy\n  import functools\n  import inspect\n  from collections import namedtuple\n  from django.core.exceptions import FieldError\n  from django.db.models.constants import LOOKUP_SEP\n  from django.utils import tree\n  from django.db.models.lookups import Lookup\n  from django.db.models.lookups import Transform\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   38:     conditional = True\n[C]   39: \n[C]   40:     def __init__(self, *args, _connector=None, _negated=False, **kwargs):\n[C]   41:         super().__init__(children=[*args, *sorted(kwargs.items())], connector=_connector, negated=_negated)\n[C]   42: \n[C]   43:     def _combine(self, other, conn):\n[C]   44:         if not isinstance(other, Q):\n[C]   45:             raise TypeError(other)\n[C]   46: \n[C]   47:         # If the other Q() is empty, ignore it and just use `self`.\n[R]   48:         if not other:\n[R]   49:             return copy.deepcopy(self)\n[R]   50:         # Or if this Q is empty, ignore it and just use `other`.\n[R]   51:         elif not self:\n[R]   52:             return copy.deepcopy(other)\n[C]   53: \n[C]   54:         obj = type(self)()\n[C]   55:         obj.connector = conn\n[C]   56:         obj.add(self, conn)\n[C]   57:         obj.add(other, conn)\n[C]   58:         return obj\n[C]   59: \n[C]   60:     def __or__(self, other):\n[C]   61:         return self._combine(other, self.OR)\n[C]   62: \n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py lines 50-54\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import copy\n  from django.utils.hashable import make_hashable\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   40:         obj.__class__ = cls\n[C]   41:         return obj\n[C]   42: \n[C]   43:     def __str__(self):\n[C]   44:         template = '(NOT (%s: %s))' if self.negated else '(%s: %s)'\n[C]   45:         return template % (self.connector, ', '.join(str(c) for c in self.children))\n[C]   46: \n[C]   47:     def __repr__(self):\n[C]   48:         return \"<%s: %s>\" % (self.__class__.__name__, self)\n[C]   49: \n[R]   50:     def __deepcopy__(self, memodict):\n[R]   51:         obj = Node(connector=self.connector, negated=self.negated)\n[R]   52:         obj.__class__ = self.__class__\n[R]   53:         obj.children = copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)\n[R]   54:         return obj\n[C]   55: \n[C]   56:     def __len__(self):\n[C]   57:         \"\"\"Return the number of children this node has.\"\"\"\n[C]   58:         return len(self.children)\n[C]   59: \n[C]   60:     def __bool__(self):\n[C]   61:         \"\"\"Return whether or not this node has children.\"\"\"\n[C]   62:         return bool(self.children)\n[C]   63: \n[C]   64:     def __contains__(self, other):\n\nYou must pay close attention to **indentation** — especially the relative indentation level between the patch and its parent scope (for example, the containing class or function).\n⚠️ **Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n⚠️ **Do not combine fixes for different locations into one block** — every location's fix should be in a **separate** ```python```code block.\n\nHere are the suggestions from the Suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context.

    "response": "# Bug Investigation and Repair Summary: Django Q Object TypeError with Non-Pickleable Types\n\n## Main Objective\nInvestigate and repair a bug in Django's Q object implementation where using the `|` (OR) operator with Q objects containing non-pickleable types (like `dict_keys`) causes a `TypeError` during the pickling process.\n\n## Complete Investigation Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` \n- **Target**: Django project structure (`/root/hy/projects_3/django`)\n- **Result**: Located the main Django codebase and identified the `django/db/models/` directory as the likely location for Q object implementation\n\n### 2. Q Object Implementation Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Q class is defined starting at line 29\n  - Q inherits from `tree.Node` (imported from `django.utils.tree`)\n  - The `|` operator is implemented via `__or__` method (line 60) which calls `_combine(other, self.OR)`\n  - The `_combine` method uses `copy.deepcopy()` on lines 49 and 52\n\n### 3. Root Cause Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py`\n- **Critical Discovery**: \n  - The `Node` class implements `__deepcopy__` method (lines 50-54)\n  - Line 53: `obj.children = copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)` is the problematic line\n  - This attempts to deep copy all children, including non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys`\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Bug Location and Flow\nThe bug occurs in the interaction between:\n1. **Q._combine()** method in `query_utils.py` (lines 49, 52) - calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n2. **Node.__deepcopy__()** method in `tree.py` (line 53) - attempts to deep copy children containing non-pickleable objects\n\n### Problem Flow\n1. User creates Q object with `dict_keys`: `Q(field__in=some_dict.keys())` ✅ Works\n2. User combines with another Q using `|`: `q1 | q2` ❌ Fails\n3. `__or__` calls `_combine()` which calls `copy.deepcopy()`\n4. `__deepcopy__` tries to pickle `dict_keys` object, causing TypeError\n\n## Precise Bug Locations Identified\n\n### Location 1: Q._combine method - Early return deepcopy calls\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py`\n**Lines**: 48-52\n```python\nif not other:\n    return copy.deepcopy(self)  # Line 49 - Bug location\n# Or if this Q is empty, ignore it and just use `other`.\nelif not self:\n    return copy.deepcopy(other)  # Line 52 - Bug location\n```\n\n### Location 2: Node.__deepcopy__ method - Children deepcopy\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py`  \n**Lines**: 50-54\n```python\ndef __deepcopy__(self, memodict):\n    obj = Node(connector=self.connector, negated=self.negated)\n    obj.__class__ = self.__class__\n    obj.children = copy.deepcopy(self.children, memodict)  # Line 53 - Actual failure point\n    return obj\n```\n\n## Implemented Solution\n\n### Fix Strategy\nThe solution implements a robust fallback mechanism in the `__deepcopy__` method that:\n1. First attempts normal `copy.deepcopy()` operation\n2. If it fails with TypeError (indicating non-pickleable objects), converts non-pickleable objects to pickleable equivalents\n3. Specifically handles `dict_keys`, `dict_values`, and `dict_items` by converting them to lists\n4. Preserves the logical meaning of Q object operations while ensuring compatibility\n\n### Patch Details\n\n**Location 1 Patch** (`/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py`):\n- **Decision**: Keep existing `copy.deepcopy()` calls unchanged\n- **Rationale**: Let the enhanced `__deepcopy__` method handle the non-pickleable objects\n\n**Location 2 Patch** (`/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py`):\n- **Enhancement**: Added try-catch mechanism in `__deepcopy__` method\n- **Fallback Logic**: \n  - Converts `dict_keys`, `dict_values`, `dict_items` to lists using `make_pickleable()` helper\n  - Handles (field, value) tuples where value might be non-pickleable\n  - Maintains backward compatibility for all existing functionality\n\n### Key Implementation Features\n1. **Graceful Degradation**: Normal deepcopy attempted first, fallback only on failure\n2. **Type Preservation**: Logical meaning preserved (dict_keys → list maintains iteration behavior)\n3. **Comprehensive Handling**: Covers various non-pickleable types that might be encountered\n4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality remains unchanged\n5. **Minimal Performance Impact**: Fallback only triggered when necessary\n\n## Current Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Root cause identified and analyzed\n- ✅ **Completed**: Exact bug locations pinpointed\n- ✅ **Completed**: Solution strategy developed\n- ✅ **Completed**: Patches implemented for both locations\n- ❌ **Pending**: Testing the fix with actual reproduction case\n- ❌ **Pending**: Verification that existing functionality remains intact\n\n## Important Technical Details\n- **File Locations**:\n  - Q class: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/db/models/query_utils.py:29`\n  - Node class: `/root/hy/projects_3/django/django/utils/tree.py:11`\n- **Key Methods**: `Q._combine()`, `Q.__or__()`, `Node.__deepcopy__()`\n- **Error Context**: The issue only occurs when combining Q objects, not when creating them initially\n- **Inheritance Chain**: Q → tree.Node → object\n- **Fix Approach**: Enhanced `__deepcopy__` method with fallback mechanism for non-pickleable objects\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Create test case**: Reproduce the original bug scenario (`Q() | Q(x__in={}.keys())`)\n2. **Verify fix**: Confirm the patches resolve the TypeError\n3. **Regression testing**: Ensure existing Q object functionality remains intact\n4. **Edge case testing**: Test with various non-pickleable types beyond dict_keys\n\nThis investigation successfully identified the root cause, implemented a comprehensive solution, and is ready for testing and validation.",
