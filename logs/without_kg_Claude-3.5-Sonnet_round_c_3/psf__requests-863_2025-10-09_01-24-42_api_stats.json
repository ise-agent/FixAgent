This prevents using multiple hooks from a session easily\n\nMy goal is to locate the specific code in the Request class where:\n- The `__init__` method processes the hooks parameter\n- The `register_hook()` method is defined\n- Where hooks are consumed/called\n\nLet me start by exploring the project structure to find the Request class.\n\n#TOOL_CALL explore_directory { \"dir_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nContents of /root/hy/projects_3/requests:\n.env\n.gitignore\n.travis.yml\nAUTHORS.rst\nHISTORY.rst\nLICENSE\nMANIFEST.in\nMakefile\nNOTICE\nREADME.rst\ndocs/\next/\nrequests/\nrequirements.txt\nsetup.py\ntest_code.patch\ntests/\n\n\nAssistant: #TOOL_CALL explore_directory { \"dir_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nContents of /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests:\n__init__.py\n_oauth.py\napi.py\nasync.py\nauth.py\ncacert.pem\ncerts.py\ncompat.py\ncookies.py\ndefaults.py\nexceptions.py\nhooks.py\nmodels.py\npackages/\nsafe_mode.py\nsessions.py\nstatus_codes.py\nstructures.py\nutils.py\n\n\nAssistant: #TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/models.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/models.py\nError reading file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/root/hy/projects_3/requests/models.py'\n\nAssistant: #TOOL_CALL execute_shell_command_with_validation { \"command\": \"find /root/hy/projects_3/requests -name '*.py' -exec grep -l 'class Request' {} \\\\;\", \"working_directory\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\n[❌ Tool execution error: 1 validation error for execute_shell_command_with_validation\ncommand\n  Field required [type=missing, input_value={}, input_type=dict]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/missing]\n\nAssistant: #TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"class Request\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'class Request' in directory (showing first 7 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/cookies.py\nLines 131-137:\n 131:     Use .get and .set and include domain and path args in order to be more specific.\"\"\"\n 132: \n 133: \n 134: class RequestsCookieJar(cookielib.CookieJar, collections.MutableMapping):\n 135:     \"\"\"Compatibility class; is a cookielib.CookieJar, but exposes a dict interface.\n 136: \n 137:     This is the CookieJar we create by default for requests and sessions that\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/exceptions.py\nLines 9-15:\n   9: \"\"\"\n  10: \n  11: \n  12: class RequestException(RuntimeError):\n  13:     \"\"\"There was an ambiguous exception that occurred while handling your\n  14:     request.\"\"\"\n  15: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 40-46:\n  40: CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE = 10 * 1024\n  41: \n  42: \n  43: class Request(object):\n  44:     \"\"\"The :class:`Request <Request>` object.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Bug Investigation Summary: Request Class Hook Handling\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the Request class's hook handling mechanism within the requests library project.\n\n## Bug Analysis\nThrough code exploration, I identified the specific bug in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py`:\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Lines 149-152 show the buggy hook processing logic in `Request.__init__()`\n- When hooks are passed as a parameter, the code iterates through `hooks.items()` and calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)`\n- If `v` (the hook value) is a list of functions, `register_hook()` will wrap it in another list, making it non-callable\n- This prevents proper handling of multiple hooks from a session\n\n**Specific Code Location:**\n```python\n# Lines 149-152 in models.py\nhooks = hooks or {}\n\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)  # BUG: v could be a list\n```\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n1. **Project Structure Exploration:**\n   - Explored `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/` directory structure\n   - Identified the main requests module location\n\n2. **Code Search and Location:**\n   - Used `search_code_with_context` to find the Request class definition\n   - Located the Request class in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py` at line 43\n\n3. **Detailed Code Analysis:**\n   - Read the Request class `__init__` method (lines 48-177)\n   - Found the hook initialization logic (lines 143-152)\n   - Identified the bug in the hook registration loop\n\n## Technical Details\n\n**Current Hook Processing Logic:**\n- Line 144: `self.hooks = {}` - Initialize empty hooks dictionary\n- Lines 146-147: Initialize hook events with empty lists\n- Lines 149-152: Process incoming hooks parameter with the buggy logic\n\n**The Bug:**\nThe `register_hook()` method (not yet examined) likely expects individual hook functions, but when a list of hooks is passed from a session, the current code doesn't flatten the list properly.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n✅ **Completed:**\n- Located the Request class and identified the bug location\n- Understood the hook initialization flow\n- Identified the specific problematic code lines (149-152)\n\n🔄 **Next Steps Needed:**\n1. Examine the `register_hook()` method implementation to understand how it handles different input types\n2. Examine the `HOOKS` constant to understand available hook events\n3. Create a fix that properly handles both individual hooks and lists of hooks\n4. Test the fix to ensure it doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: To navigate project structure\n- `search_code_with_context`: To locate the Request class\n- `read_file_lines`: To examine specific code sections in models.py\n\n## Critical Finding\nThe bug is definitively located in the Request class constructor's hook processing logic, where lists of hook functions are not properly flattened before registration, causing them to become non-callable when wrapped in additional list structures.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\", \"start_line\": 93, \"end_line\": 150 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\nTotal lines: 888\nShowing lines 93-142:\n\n  93:         self.method = method\n  94: \n  95:         #: Dictionary, bytes or file stream of request body data to attach to the\n  96:         #: :class:`Request <Request>`.\n  97:         self.data = None\n  98: \n  99:         #: Dictionary or byte of querystring data to attach to the\n 100:         #: :class:`Request <Request>`.

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**The Bug Analysis:**\n1. **HOOKS constant**: Contains 5 hook events: `('args', 'pre_request', 'pre_send', 'post_request', 'response')`\n\n2. **register_hook method** (line 463-466): Simply appends the hook to the event's list:\n   ```python\n   def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n       \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n       self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n   ```\n\n3. **The Problem** (lines 149-152): When processing the hooks parameter:\n   ```python\n   for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n       self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n   ```\n   - If `v` is a single function, it gets appended correctly\n   - If `v` is a list of functions `[func1, func2]`, the entire list gets appended as one item: `[[func1, func2]]`\n   - Later when hooks are dispatched, the system tries to call the list instead of the individual functions\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe code in lines 149-152 needs to be modified to handle both single functions and lists of functions properly. When `v` is a list, each function in the list should be registered individually.\n\n**Locations to Fix:**\n- **Primary location**: Lines 149-152 in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py` - the hook processing loop in Request.__init__()\n\nThis is the single bug location that needs to be fixed. The register_hook method is working correctly - it's designed to append individual hooks. The problem is in how the hooks parameter is processed before calling register_hook.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is located at **lines 149-152** in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py`. The current code processes the hooks parameter incorrectly by passing entire lists to `register_hook()` instead of individual hook functions. The fix requires modifying the loop to detect when a hook value is a list and register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single function values.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list.

The current implementation at lines 149-152 iterates through the hooks dictionary and calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each key-value pair. When `v` is a list of hook functions, the entire list gets passed to `register_hook()`, which then appends the list as a single item to the hooks list, creating a nested structure like `[[func1, func2]]`. Later, when hooks are dispatched, the system tries to call the list instead of the individual functions, causing the failure.\n\nThe `register_hook()` method itself is working correctly - it's designed to append individual hooks.

The bug is in the Request class constructor's hook processing logic (lines 149-152)\n2. When hooks are passed as a parameter, the code calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each hook\n3. If `v` is a list of functions, `register_hook()` likely wraps it in another list, making it non-callable\n4. This prevents proper handling of multiple hooks from a session\n\n**What I need to examine next:**\nI need to see the `register_hook()` method implementation to understand exactly how it handles different input types, and also check what the `HOOKS` constant contains. This will help me understand the complete picture of how hooks should be processed.\n\nLet me find the `register_hook` method implementation.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"def register_hook\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'def register_hook' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 460-466:\n 460: \n 461:         return ''.join(url)\n 462: \n 463:     def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n 464:         \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n 465: \n 466:         self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"HOOKS\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'HOOKS' in file (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 12-18:\n  12: from datetime import datetime\n  13: from io import BytesIO\n  14: \n  15: from .hooks import dispatch_hook, HOOKS\n  16: from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\n  17: from .status_codes import codes\n  18: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 143-149:\n 143:         #: Event-handling hooks.\n 144:         self.hooks = {}\n 145: \n 146:         for event in HOOKS:\n 147:             self.hooks[event] = []\n 148: \n 149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"HOOKS\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/hooks.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'HOOKS' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/hooks.py\nLines 26-32:\n  26: \"\"\"\n  27: \n  28: \n  29: HOOKS = ('args', 'pre_request', 'pre_send', 'post_request', 'response')\n  30: \n  31: \n  32: def dispatch_hook(key, hooks, hook_data):\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug! Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**The Bug Analysis:**\n1. **HOOKS constant**: Contains 5 hook events: `('args', 'pre_request', 'pre_send', 'post_request', 'response')`\n\n2. **register_hook method** (line 463-466): Simply appends the hook to the event's list:\n   ```python\n   def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n       \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n       self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n   ```\n\n3. **The Problem** (lines 149-152): When processing the hooks parameter:\n   ```python\n   for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n       self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n   ```\n   - If `v` is a single function, it gets appended correctly\n   - If `v` is a list of functions `[func1, func2]`, the entire list gets appended as one item: `[[func1, func2]]`\n   - Later when hooks are dispatched, the system tries to call the list instead of the individual functions\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe code in lines 149-152 needs to be modified to handle both single functions and lists of functions properly. When `v` is a list, each function in the list should be registered individually.\n\n**Locations to Fix:**\n- **Primary location**: Lines 149-152 in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py` - the hook processing loop in Request.__init__()\n\nThis is the single bug location that needs to be fixed. The register_hook method is working correctly - it's designed to append individual hooks. The problem is in how the hooks parameter is processed before calling register_hook.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is located at **lines 149-152** in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py`. The current code processes the hooks parameter incorrectly by passing entire lists to `register_hook()` instead of individual hook functions. The fix requires modifying the loop to detect when a hook value is a list and register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single function values.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug described in the problem statement, I have identified the root cause and the specific location that needs to be fixed.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the Request class's `__init__` method where it processes the `hooks` parameter. The current implementation at lines 149-152 iterates through the hooks dictionary and calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each key-value pair. When `v` is a list of hook functions, the entire list gets passed to `register_hook()`, which then appends the list as a single item to the hooks list, creating a nested structure like `[[func1, func2]]`. Later, when hooks are dispatched, the system tries to call the list instead of the individual functions, causing the failure.\n\nThe `register_hook()` method itself is working correctly - it's designed to append individual hooks. The problem is in the preprocessing logic that doesn't handle lists properly.\n\n**Fix Required:**\nThe hook processing loop needs to be modified to detect when a hook value is a list and register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single function values.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 149,\n            \"end_line\": 152\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",

The bug is in the Request class constructor's hook processing logic (lines 149-152)\n2. When hooks are passed as a parameter, the code calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each hook\n3. If `v` is a list of functions, `register_hook()` likely wraps it in another list, making it non-callable\n4. This prevents proper handling of multiple hooks from a session\n\n**What I need to examine next:**\nI need to see the `register_hook()` method implementation to understand exactly how it handles different input types, and also check what the `HOOKS` constant contains. This will help me understand the complete picture of how hooks should be processed.\n\nLet me find the `register_hook` method implementation.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"def register_hook\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'def register_hook' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 460-466:\n 460: \n 461:         return ''.join(url)\n 462: \n 463:     def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n 464:         \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n 465: \n 466:         self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"HOOKS\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'HOOKS' in file (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 12-18:\n  12: from datetime import datetime\n  13: from io import BytesIO\n  14: \n  15: from .hooks import dispatch_hook, HOOKS\n  16: from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\n  17: from .status_codes import codes\n  18: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 143-149:\n 143:         #: Event-handling hooks.\n 144:         self.hooks = {}\n 145: \n 146:         for event in HOOKS:\n 147:             self.hooks[event] = []\n 148: \n 149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"HOOKS\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/hooks.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'HOOKS' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/hooks.py\nLines 26-32:\n  26: \"\"\"\n  27: \n  28: \n  29: HOOKS = ('args', 'pre_request', 'pre_send', 'post_request', 'response')\n  30: \n  31: \n  32: def dispatch_hook(key, hooks, hook_data):\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug! Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**The Bug Analysis:**\n1. **HOOKS constant**: Contains 5 hook events: `('args', 'pre_request', 'pre_send', 'post_request', 'response')`\n\n2. **register_hook method** (line 463-466): Simply appends the hook to the event's list:\n   ```python\n   def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n       \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n       self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n   ```\n\n3. **The Problem** (lines 149-152): When processing the hooks parameter:\n   ```python\n   for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n       self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n   ```\n   - If `v` is a single function, it gets appended correctly\n   - If `v` is a list of functions `[func1, func2]`, the entire list gets appended as one item: `[[func1, func2]]`\n   - Later when hooks are dispatched, the system tries to call the list instead of the individual functions\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe code in lines 149-152 needs to be modified to handle both single functions and lists of functions properly. When `v` is a list, each function in the list should be registered individually.\n\n**Locations to Fix:**\n- **Primary location**: Lines 149-152 in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py` - the hook processing loop in Request.__init__()\n\nThis is the single bug location that needs to be fixed. The register_hook method is working correctly - it's designed to append individual hooks. The problem is in how the hooks parameter is processed before calling register_hook.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is located at **lines 149-152** in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py`. The current code processes the hooks parameter incorrectly by passing entire lists to `register_hook()` instead of individual hook functions. The fix requires modifying the loop to detect when a hook value is a list and register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single function values.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug described in the problem statement, I have identified the root cause and the specific location that needs to be fixed.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the Request class's `__init__` method where it processes the `hooks` parameter. The current implementation at lines 149-152 iterates through the hooks dictionary and calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each key-value pair. When `v` is a list of hook functions, the entire list gets passed to `register_hook()`, which then appends the list as a single item to the hooks list, creating a nested structure like `[[func1, func2]]`. Later, when hooks are dispatched, the system tries to call the list instead of the individual functions, causing the failure.\n\nThe `register_hook()` method itself is working correctly - it's designed to append individual hooks. The problem is in the preprocessing logic that doesn't handle lists properly.\n\n**Fix Required:**\nThe hook processing loop needs to be modified to detect when a hook value is a list and register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single function values.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 149,\n            \"end_line\": 152\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture!

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nLooking at the code segment and the suggestion provided, I can see that:\n\n**Current Code (Lines 149-152):**\n```python\nhooks = hooks or {}\n\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n```\n\n**The Problem:**\n- When `v` is a list of functions like `[func1, func2]`, the entire list gets passed to `register_hook()`\n- `register_hook()` simply appends whatever it receives to `self.hooks[event]`\n- This creates `[[func1, func2]]` instead of `[func1, func2]`\n- Later, when hooks are dispatched, the system tries to call the list instead of individual functions\n\n**The Suggested Fix:**\n```python\nhooks = hooks or {}\n\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    if hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not callable(v):\n        # v is a list/iterable of hook functions\n        for hook in v:\n            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=hook)\n    else:\n        # v is a single hook function\n        self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe suggestion is technically sound and addresses the core issue. It:\n1. Checks if `v` is iterable but not callable (distinguishing lists from functions)\n2. If it's a list, iterates through each function and registers them individually\n3. If it's a single function, registers it directly\n4. Maintains backward compatibility\n\nThe location is correct and the fix is appropriate for the problem described.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe location is ready for fixing. The suggested implementation correctly addresses the core issue by:\n\n1. **Detecting lists vs single functions**: Using `hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not callable(v)` properly distinguishes between lists of functions and single callable functions\n2. **Handling both cases**: Iterates through lists to register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single functions\n3. **Preserving existing behavior**: The `register_hook()` method remains unchanged, so existing functionality is preserved\n4. **Solving the root problem**: This allows the hooks parameter to accept `{'response': [func1, func2]}` format as requested\n\nThe fix is targeted, minimal, and directly addresses the problem statement without breaking existing functionality.",

Examine the `register_hook()` method implementation to understand how it handles different input types\n2. Examine the `HOOKS` constant to understand available hook events\n3.

The bug is in the Request class constructor's hook processing logic (lines 149-152)\n2. When hooks are passed as a parameter, the code calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each hook\n3. If `v` is a list of functions, `register_hook()` likely wraps it in another list, making it non-callable\n4. This prevents proper handling of multiple hooks from a session\n\n**What I need to examine next:**\nI need to see the `register_hook()` method implementation to understand exactly how it handles different input types, and also check what the `HOOKS` constant contains. This will help me understand the complete picture of how hooks should be processed.\n\nLet me find the `register_hook` method implementation.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"def register_hook\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'def register_hook' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 460-466:\n 460: \n 461:         return ''.join(url)\n 462: \n 463:     def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n 464:         \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n 465: \n 466:         self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: #TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"HOOKS\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'HOOKS' in file (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 12-18:\n  12: from datetime import datetime\n  13: from io import BytesIO\n  14: \n  15: from .hooks import dispatch_hook, HOOKS\n  16: from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\n  17: from .status_codes import codes\n  18: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 143-149:\n 143:         #: Event-handling hooks.\n 144:         self.hooks = {}\n 145: \n 146:         for event in HOOKS:\n 147:             self.hooks[event] = []\n 148: \n 149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: #TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"HOOKS\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/hooks.py\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'HOOKS' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/hooks.py\nLines 26-32:\n  26: \"\"\"\n  27: \n  28: \n  29: HOOKS = ('args', 'pre_request', 'pre_send', 'post_request', 'response')\n  30: \n  31: \n  32: def dispatch_hook(key, hooks, hook_data):\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug! Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**The Bug Analysis:**\n1. **HOOKS constant**: Contains 5 hook events: `('args', 'pre_request', 'pre_send', 'post_request', 'response')`\n\n2. **register_hook method** (line 463-466): Simply appends the hook to the event's list:\n   ```python\n   def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n       \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n       self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n   ```\n\n3. **The Problem** (lines 149-152): When processing the hooks parameter:\n   ```python\n   for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n       self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n   ```\n   - If `v` is a single function, it gets appended correctly\n   - If `v` is a list of functions `[func1, func2]`, the entire list gets appended as one item: `[[func1, func2]]`\n   - Later when hooks are dispatched, the system tries to call the list instead of the individual functions\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe code in lines 149-152 needs to be modified to handle both single functions and lists of functions properly. When `v` is a list, each function in the list should be registered individually.\n\n**Locations to Fix:**\n- **Primary location**: Lines 149-152 in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py` - the hook processing loop in Request.__init__()\n\nThis is the single bug location that needs to be fixed. The register_hook method is working correctly - it's designed to append individual hooks. The problem is in how the hooks parameter is processed before calling register_hook.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is located at **lines 149-152** in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py`. The current code processes the hooks parameter incorrectly by passing entire lists to `register_hook()` instead of individual hook functions. The fix requires modifying the loop to detect when a hook value is a list and register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single function values.\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: **PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug described in the problem statement, I have identified the root cause and the specific location that needs to be fixed.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the Request class's `__init__` method where it processes the `hooks` parameter. The current implementation at lines 149-152 iterates through the hooks dictionary and calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each key-value pair. When `v` is a list of hook functions, the entire list gets passed to `register_hook()`, which then appends the list as a single item to the hooks list, creating a nested structure like `[[func1, func2]]`. Later, when hooks are dispatched, the system tries to call the list instead of the individual functions, causing the failure.\n\nThe `register_hook()` method itself is working correctly - it's designed to append individual hooks. The problem is in the preprocessing logic that doesn't handle lists properly.\n\n**Fix Required:**\nThe hook processing loop needs to be modified to detect when a hook value is a list and register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single function values.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 149,\n            \"end_line\": 152\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture! The problem statement confirms my analysis:\n\n**The Issue:**\n- The Request class's `__init__()` method doesn't properly handle lists of hook functions in the hooks parameter\n- Currently, if you pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}`, the code wraps the list in another list, making it `[[func1, func2]]`\n- This breaks hook execution because lists aren't callable\n- This prevents using multiple hooks from a session easily\n\n**The Solution Needed:**\nModify the hook processing logic in lines 149-152 to detect when a hook value is a list and register each function individually, while still supporting single functions.\n\n**Current Code (Buggy):**\n```python\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)  # Problem: v could be a list\n```\n\n**Required Fix:**\nThe code should check if `v` is a list and iterate through it, or handle it as a single function if not.\n\nI'm ready to propose the specific repair suggestion.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Lines 149-152 in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py`**: Replace the current hook processing loop with logic that properly handles both single functions and lists of functions. The fix should:\n   - Check if the hook value `v` is a list/iterable of functions\n   - If it's a list, iterate through each function and call `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=func)` for each one\n   - If it's a single function, call `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` as before\n   - This maintains backward compatibility while enabling the desired functionality of passing lists of hook functions\n\n   **Suggested implementation:**\n   ```python\n   hooks = hooks or {}\n   \n   for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n       if hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not callable(v):\n           # v is a list/iterable of hook functions\n           for hook in v:\n               self.register_hook(event=k, hook=hook)\n       else:\n           # v is a single hook function\n           self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n   ```\n\n   This change allows the hooks parameter to accept both single functions and lists of functions as values, enabling multiple hooks from sessions to work properly without requiring manual `.register_hook()` calls after object creation.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py lines 149-152\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        hooks = hooks or {}\n\n        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nLooking at the code segment and the suggestion provided, I can see that:\n\n**Current Code (Lines 149-152):**\n```python\nhooks = hooks or {}\n\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n```\n\n**The Problem:**\n- When `v` is a list of functions like `[func1, func2]`, the entire list gets passed to `register_hook()`\n- `register_hook()` simply appends whatever it receives to `self.hooks[event]`\n- This creates `[[func1, func2]]` instead of `[func1, func2]`\n- Later, when hooks are dispatched, the system tries to call the list instead of individual functions\n\n**The Suggested Fix:**\n```python\nhooks = hooks or {}\n\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    if hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not callable(v):\n        # v is a list/iterable of hook functions\n        for hook in v:\n            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=hook)\n    else:\n        # v is a single hook function\n        self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe suggestion is technically sound and addresses the core issue. It:\n1. Checks if `v` is iterable but not callable (distinguishing lists from functions)\n2. If it's a list, iterates through each function and registers them individually\n3. If it's a single function, registers it directly\n4. Maintains backward compatibility\n\nThe location is correct and the fix is appropriate for the problem described.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe location is ready for fixing. The suggested implementation correctly addresses the core issue by:\n\n1. **Detecting lists vs single functions**: Using `hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not callable(v)` properly distinguishes between lists of functions and single callable functions\n2. **Handling both cases**: Iterates through lists to register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single functions\n3. **Preserving existing behavior**: The `register_hook()` method remains unchanged, so existing functionality is preserved\n4. **Solving the root problem**: This allows the hooks parameter to accept `{'response': [func1, func2]}` format as requested\n\nThe fix is targeted, minimal, and directly addresses the problem statement without breaking existing functionality.\nUser: [Location 1] /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py lines 149-152\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import os\n  import socket\n  from datetime import datetime\n  from io import BytesIO\n  from .hooks import dispatch_hook, HOOKS\n  from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\n  from .status_codes import codes\n  from .auth import HTTPBasicAuth, HTTPProxyAuth\n  from .cookies import cookiejar_from_dict, extract_cookies_to_jar, get_cookie_header\n  from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import MaxRetryError, LocationParseError\n  from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import TimeoutError\n  from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import SSLError as _SSLError\n  from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as _HTTPError\n  from .packages.urllib3 import connectionpool, poolmanager\n  from .packages.urllib3.filepost import encode_multipart_formdata\n  from .defaults import SCHEMAS\n  from .exceptions import (\n  from .utils import (\n  from .compat import (\n  from given response.\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  139: \n[C]  140:         #: True if Request has been sent.\n[C]  141:         self.sent = False\n[C]  142: \n[C]  143:         #: Event-handling hooks.\n[C]  144:         self.hooks = {}\n[C]  145: \n[C]  146:         for event in HOOKS:\n[C]  147:             self.hooks[event] = []\n[C]  148: \n[R]  149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n[R]  150: \n[R]  151:         for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n[R]  152:             self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n[C]  153: \n[C]  154:         #: Session.\n[C]  155:         self.session = session\n[C]  156: \n[C]  157:         #: SSL Verification.\n[C]  158:         self.verify = verify\n[C]  159: \n[C]  160:         #: SSL Certificate\n[C]  161:         self.cert = cert\n[C]  162: \n\nYou must pay close attention to **indentation** — especially the relative indentation level between the patch and its parent scope (for example, the containing class or function).\n⚠️ **Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n⚠️ **Do not combine fixes for different locations into one block** — every location's fix should be in a **separate** ```python```code block.\n\nHere are the suggestions from the Suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture!

It:\n1. Checks if `v` is iterable but not callable (distinguishing lists from functions)\n2. If it's a list, iterates through each function and registers them individually\n3. If it's a single function, registers it directly\n4. Maintains backward compatibility\n\nThe location is correct and the fix is appropriate for the problem described.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe location is ready for fixing. The suggested implementation correctly addresses the core issue by:\n\n1. **Detecting lists vs single functions**: Using `hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not callable(v)` properly distinguishes between lists of functions and single callable functions\n2. **Handling both cases**: Iterates through lists to register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single functions\n3. **Preserving existing behavior**: The `register_hook()` method remains unchanged, so existing functionality is preserved\n4. **Solving the root problem**: This allows the hooks parameter to accept `{'response': [func1, func2]}` format as requested\n\nThe fix is targeted, minimal, and directly addresses the problem statement without breaking existing functionality.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py lines 149-152\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import os\n  import socket\n  from datetime import datetime\n  from io import BytesIO\n  from .hooks import dispatch_hook, HOOKS\n  from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\n  from .status_codes import codes\n  from .auth import HTTPBasicAuth, HTTPProxyAuth\n  from .cookies import cookiejar_from_dict, extract_cookies_to_jar, get_cookie_header\n  from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import MaxRetryError, LocationParseError\n  from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import TimeoutError\n  from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import SSLError as _SSLError\n  from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as _HTTPError\n  from .packages.urllib3 import connectionpool, poolmanager\n  from .packages.urllib3.filepost import encode_multipart_formdata\n  from .defaults import SCHEMAS\n  from .exceptions import (\n  from .utils import (\n  from .compat import (\n  from given response.\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  139: \n[C]  140:         #: True if Request has been sent.\n[C]  141:         self.sent = False\n[C]  142: \n[C]  143:         #: Event-handling hooks.\n[C]  144:         self.hooks = {}\n[C]  145: \n[C]  146:         for event in HOOKS:\n[C]  147:             self.hooks[event] = []\n[C]  148: \n[R]  149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n[R]  150: \n[R]  151:         for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n[R]  152:             self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n[C]  153: \n[C]  154:         #: Session.\n[C]  155:         self.session = session\n[C]  156: \n[C]  157:         #: SSL Verification.\n[C]  158:         self.verify = verify\n[C]  159: \n[C]  160:         #: SSL Certificate\n[C]  161:         self.cert = cert\n[C]  162: \n\nYou must pay close attention to **indentation** — especially the relative indentation level between the patch and its parent scope (for example, the containing class or function).\n⚠️ **Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n⚠️ **Do not combine fixes for different locations into one block** — every location's fix should be in a **separate** ```python```code block.\n\nHere are the suggestions from the Suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture!

The problem statement confirms my analysis:\n\n**The Issue:**\n- The Request class's `__init__()` method doesn't properly handle lists of hook functions in the hooks parameter\n- Currently, if you pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}`, the code wraps the list in another list, making it `[[func1, func2]]`\n- This breaks hook execution because lists aren't callable\n- This prevents using multiple hooks from a session easily\n\n**The Solution Needed:**\nModify the hook processing logic in lines 149-152 to detect when a hook value is a list and register each function individually, while still supporting single functions.\n\n**Current Code (Buggy):**\n```python\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)  # Problem: v could be a list\n```\n\n**Required Fix:**\nThe code should check if `v` is a list and iterate through it, or handle it as a single function if not.\n\nI'm ready to propose the specific repair suggestion.\n\nS\n\n1. **Lines 149-152 in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/models.py`**: Replace the current hook processing loop with logic that properly handles both single functions and lists of functions. The fix should:\n   - Check if the hook value `v` is a list/iterable of functions\n   - If it's a list, iterate through each function and call `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=func)` for each one\n   - If it's a single function, call `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` as before\n   - This maintains backward compatibility while enabling the desired functionality of passing lists of hook functions\n\n   **Suggested implementation:**\n   ```python\n   hooks = hooks or {}\n   \n   for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n       if hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not callable(v):\n           # v is a list/iterable of hook functions\n           for hook in v:\n               self.register_hook(event=k, hook=hook)\n       else:\n           # v is a single hook function\n           self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n   ```\n\n   This change allows the hooks parameter to accept both single functions and lists of functions as values, enabling multiple hooks from sessions to work properly without requiring manual `.register_hook()` calls after object creation.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",
