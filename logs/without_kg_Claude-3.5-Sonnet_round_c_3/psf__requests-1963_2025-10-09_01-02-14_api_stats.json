The problem is in the `Session.resolve_redirects` method in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py`.\n\nThe bug occurs because:\n1. Line 91 always copies the original request (`req.copy()`) instead of using the current state\n2. Line 102 gets the method from the original request (`req.method`) instead of the current prepared request\n\nThis causes the method changes from previous redirects (like 303 See Other converting POST to GET) to be lost in subsequent redirects.\n\nThe fix requires:\n1. **Line 91**: Change to use the current prepared_request from previous iteration (or req for first iteration)\n2. **Line 102**: Change to get method from the current prepared_request instead of original req\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my analysis of the `Session.resolve_redirects` method in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py`, I have identified the exact locations where the bug occurs:\n\n**Bug Location 1: Line 91**\n```python\nprepared_request = req.copy()\n```\nThis line always copies the original request, losing any method changes from previous redirects.\n\n**Bug Location 2: Line 102** \n```python\nmethod = req.method\n```\nThis line gets the method from the original request instead of the current prepared request state.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe method incorrectly uses the original request (`req`) throughout the redirect loop instead of maintaining the current request state. When a 303 See Other redirect converts a POST to GET, this change is lost in the next iteration because it copies the original POST request again.\n\n**Required Fix:**\n1. **Line 91**: Change to use the current prepared_request from the previous iteration (initialize with `req` for first iteration)\n2. **Line 102**: Change to get the method from the current prepared_request instead of the original `req`\n\nThe vulnerable code spans **lines 91-102** where the request copying and method selection logic needs to be corrected to preserve redirect-induced method changes.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**",

A POST request gets a 303 See Other redirect (which should convert POST to GET)\n2. The GET request then gets a 307 Temporary Redirect (which should preserve the GET method)\n3. But because `resolve_redirects` copies the original request each time, it incorrectly sends a POST instead of preserving the GET\n\nLet me start by exploring the project structure to find the relevant files.\n\n#TOOL_CALL explore_directory { \"dir_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_3/requests\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nContents of /root/hy/projects_3/requests:\n.gitignore\nAUTHORS.rst\nHISTORY.rst\nLICENSE\nMANIFEST.in\nMakefile\nNOTICE\nREADME.rst\ndocs/\next/\nrequests/\nrequirements.txt\nsetup.cfg\nsetup.py\ntest_code.patch\ntest_requests.py\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I can see the project structure.

A POST request gets a 303 See Other redirect (should convert POST to GET)\n2. The GET request then gets a 307 Temporary Redirect (should preserve the GET method)\n3. But `resolve_redirects` incorrectly sends a POST instead of preserving the GET\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: Located main code in `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/` directory\n- **Key Finding**: Identified `sessions.py` as the file containing the `Session.resolve_redirects` method\n\n### 2. Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Results**: Found and analyzed the complete `resolve_redirects` method (lines 84-185)\n- **Key Finding**: Identified the exact bug locations in the redirect handling logic\n\n### 3. Import Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `show_file_imports`\n- **Results**: Confirmed all necessary imports are already present for the fix\n\n## **PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\n### Bug Location Details\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py`\n**Method**: `Session.resolve_redirects` (lines 84-185)\n\n**Specific Bug Locations:**\n\n1. **Line 91**: \n   ```python\n   prepared_request = req.copy()\n   ```\n   **Issue**: Always copies the original request, losing method changes from previous redirects\n\n2. **Line 102**:\n   ```python\n   method = req.method\n   ```\n   **Issue**: Gets method from original request instead of current prepared_request state\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThe method incorrectly uses the original request (`req`) throughout the redirect loop instead of maintaining the current request state. When redirect status codes (303, 302, 301) change the HTTP method, these changes are lost in subsequent iterations because the code always reverts to the original request.\n\n### Required Fix Strategy\n1. **Line 91**: Modify to use the current prepared_request from previous iteration (or `req` for first iteration)\n2. **Line 102**: Change to get method from current prepared_request instead of original `req`\n3. **Preserve state**: Ensure method changes from previous redirects are maintained in the redirect chain\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Complete**: Bug location identified with exact line numbers\n- ✅ **Complete**: Root cause analysis finished\n- ✅ **Complete**: Fix strategy determined\n- 🔄 **Next Step**: Implement the actual code fix\n\n## Technical Details\n- **Vulnerable Code Range**: Lines 91-102 in the redirect loop\n- **Impact**: Affects HTTP method preservation in multi-step redirect chains\n- **Status Codes Affected**: 303 See Other, 302 Found, 301 Moved Permanently when followed by 307/308 redirects\n- **Dependencies**: No additional imports required for the fix\n\nThe analysis is complete and ready for implementation of the bug fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\nStart line: 91\nEnd line: 91\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_3/requests/requests/sessions.py\nStart line: 102\nEnd line: 102\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nPerfect!
