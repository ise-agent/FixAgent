The `Cmdoption` class in `std.py` uses a regex pattern `option_desc_re` to validate option descriptions. The pattern `[enable=]PATTERN` doesn't match the expected formats, causing the validation to fail. I need to find where `option_desc_re` is defined to understand the current regex pattern and see how it can be modified to be more permissive.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"option_desc_re\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/sphinx/sphinx/domains/std.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'option_desc_re' in file (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/sphinx/sphinx/domains/std.py\nLines 43-49:\n  43: \n  44: \n  45: # RE for option descriptions\n  46: option_desc_re = re.compile(r'((?:/|--|-|\\+)?[^\\s=[]+)(=?\\s*.*)')\n  47: # RE for grammar tokens\n  48: token_re = re.compile(r'`(\\w+)`', re.U)\n  49: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/sphinx/sphinx/domains/std.py\nLines 189-195:\n 189:         firstname = ''\n 190:         for potential_option in sig.split(', '):\n 191:             potential_option = potential_option.strip()\n 192:             m = option_desc_re.match(potential_option)\n 193:             if not m:\n 194:                 logger.warning(__('Malformed option description %r, should '\n 195:                                   'look like \"opt\", \"-opt args\", \"--opt args\", '\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have all the context I need. The issue is clear:\n\n1. The `option_desc_re` regex pattern on line 46 is: `r'((?:/|--|-|\\+)?[^\\s=[]+)(=?\\s*.*)'`\n2. This pattern expects options to start with `/`, `--`, `-`, or `+`, followed by characters that don't include `[`, `=`, or spaces\n3. The pattern `[enable=]PATTERN` fails because it starts with `[` which is not one of the allowed prefixes\n4. The regex `[^\\s=[]+` specifically excludes `[` and `=` characters in the option name part\n\nThe fix should make the regex more permissive to accept patterns like `[enable=]PATTERN`. Let me examine the regex more closely and understand what the two capture groups are meant to capture.\n\nLooking at the usage in lines 199: `optname, args = m.groups()`, the first group captures the option name and the second group captures the arguments.\n\nFor `[enable=]PATTERN`, we want:\n- First group: `[enable=]PATTERN` (the entire thing as option name)\n- Second group: empty (no additional args)\n\nThe current regex fails because `[^\\s=[]+` doesn't allow `[` or `=` in the option name.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is in `/root/hy/projects_4/sphinx/sphinx/domains/std.py` at **line 46** where the `option_desc_re` regex pattern is too restrictive. The pattern `r'((?:/|--|-|\\+)?[^\\s=[]+)(=?\\s*.*)'` should be modified to allow square brackets and equals signs in option names to support syntax like `[enable=]PATTERN`.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my investigation, I have identified the root cause of the bug. The issue is in the `option_desc_re` regex pattern in `/root/hy/projects_4/sphinx/sphinx/domains/std.py` which became overly restrictive in Sphinx 3.2, rejecting previously valid option syntax patterns like `[enable=]PATTERN`.\n\nThe regex pattern `r'((?:/|--|-|\\+)?[^\\s=[]+)(=?\\s*.*)'` on line 46 specifically excludes square brackets `[` and equals signs `=` in option names, causing the validation to fail for patterns that don't start with the expected prefixes (`/`, `--`, `-`, `+`).\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/sphinx/sphinx/domains/std.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 46,\n            \"end_line\": 46\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete context.

The current regex pattern `r'((?:/|--|-|\\+)?[^\\s=[]+)(=?\\s*.*)'` is indeed overly restrictive\n2. It explicitly excludes `[` and `=` characters in option names via `[^\\s=[]+`\n3. The pattern `[enable=]PATTERN` fails because it starts with `[` and contains `=`\n4. The suggested fix `r'([^\\s]+)(\\s+.*)?'` would make the regex much more permissive\n\nThe location is clearly identified and the fix is straightforward - it's a simple regex pattern replacement that will allow any non-whitespace characters as option names while maintaining the two-group capture structure that the rest of the code expects.\n\nThe fix aligns perfectly with the problem statement's requirement that Sphinx should \"just accept any string\" for option descriptions rather than being overly restrictive about option syntax formats.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, this location is ready for fixing. The code segment shows the exact problematic regex pattern that needs to be modified. The suggested fix of changing the regex from `r'((?:/|--|-|\\+)?[^\\s=[]+)(=?\\s*.*)'` to `r'([^\\s]+)(\\s+.*)?'` will:\n\n1. Remove the restrictive character exclusions that prevent `[enable=]PATTERN` from being accepted\n2. Allow any non-whitespace string as an option name (first capture group)\n3. Maintain the two-group capture structure expected by the downstream code\n4. Preserve backward compatibility with existing option formats\n5.
