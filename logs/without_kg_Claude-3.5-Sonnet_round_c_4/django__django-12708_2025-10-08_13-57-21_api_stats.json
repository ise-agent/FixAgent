    "response": "## Summary of Django Migration Bug Investigation\n\n### Main Objective\nFinding and repairing a bug in Django's migration system where deleting an `index_together` constraint crashes when there's a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields.\n\n### Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n1. **Project Structure Exploration**\n   - Successfully navigated to the Django codebase at `/root/hy/projects_4/django/`\n   - Located the relevant database backend code in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n\n2. **Bug Location Identification**\n   - Found the problematic method `_delete_composed_index()` starting at line 402\n   - Identified that the issue occurs when this method is called from both:\n     - `alter_unique_together()` (line 380)\n     - `alter_index_together()` (line 396)\n\n### Tools Used and Outputs\n\n- **explore_directory**: Successfully mapped the Django project structure\n- **read_file_lines**: Examined specific code sections around line 378 as mentioned in the bug report\n- **search_code_with_context**: Located all occurrences of `_delete_composed_index()` method\n\n### Current Progress Status\n\n**✅ Completed:**\n- Located the bug in `_delete_composed_index()` method (lines 402-416)\n- Identified the root cause: The method uses `_constraint_names()` to find constraints and expects exactly 1 constraint, but when both `index_together` and `unique_together` exist on the same fields, it finds multiple constraints\n\n**🔧 Issue Identified:**\nThe bug occurs in lines 410-415 where the code throws a `ValueError` when `len(constraint_names) != 1`. When there are both index and unique constraints on the same fields, the method finds multiple constraints and crashes instead of handling this scenario gracefully.\n\n### Important Technical Details\n\n1. **Bug Root Cause**: The `_delete_composed_index()` method fails when multiple constraints exist on the same fields because:\n   - Line 406-408: `_constraint_names()` finds all constraints matching the fields\n   - Line 410: Code expects exactly 1 constraint but finds 2 (index + unique)\n   - Line 411-415: Throws ValueError instead of filtering for the specific constraint type\n\n2. **Method Call Context**:\n   - Called from `alter_unique_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'unique': True}`\n   - Called from `alter_index_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n\n### Next Steps Required\n1. Examine the `_constraint_names()` method to understand how it filters constraints\n2. Modify `_delete_composed_index()` to properly handle cases where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields\n3. Ensure the method only deletes the specific type of constraint requested (unique vs index)\n4. Create/run tests to verify the fix works correctly\n\nThe investigation has successfully pinpointed the exact location and cause of the bug, setting up for targeted repair work.",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: ## Summary of Django Migration Bug Investigation\n\n### Main Objective\nFinding and repairing a bug in Django's migration system where deleting an `index_together` constraint crashes when there's a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields.\n\n### Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n1. **Project Structure Exploration**\n   - Successfully navigated to the Django codebase at `/root/hy/projects_4/django/`\n   - Located the relevant database backend code in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n\n2. **Bug Location Identification**\n   - Found the problematic method `_delete_composed_index()` starting at line 402\n   - Identified that the issue occurs when this method is called from both:\n     - `alter_unique_together()` (line 380)\n     - `alter_index_together()` (line 396)\n\n### Tools Used and Outputs\n\n- **explore_directory**: Successfully mapped the Django project structure\n- **read_file_lines**: Examined specific code sections around line 378 as mentioned in the bug report\n- **search_code_with_context**: Located all occurrences of `_delete_composed_index()` method\n\n### Current Progress Status\n\n**✅ Completed:**\n- Located the bug in `_delete_composed_index()` method (lines 402-416)\n- Identified the root cause: The method uses `_constraint_names()` to find constraints and expects exactly 1 constraint, but when both `index_together` and `unique_together` exist on the same fields, it finds multiple constraints\n\n**🔧 Issue Identified:**\nThe bug occurs in lines 410-415 where the code throws a `ValueError` when `len(constraint_names) != 1`. When there are both index and unique constraints on the same fields, the method finds multiple constraints and crashes instead of handling this scenario gracefully.\n\n### Important Technical Details\n\n1. **Bug Root Cause**: The `_delete_composed_index()` method fails when multiple constraints exist on the same fields because:\n   - Line 406-408: `_constraint_names()` finds all constraints matching the fields\n   - Line 410: Code expects exactly 1 constraint but finds 2 (index + unique)\n   - Line 411-415: Throws ValueError instead of filtering for the specific constraint type\n\n2. **Method Call Context**:\n   - Called from `alter_unique_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'unique': True}`\n   - Called from `alter_index_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n\n### Next Steps Required\n1. Examine the `_constraint_names()` method to understand how it filters constraints\n2. Modify `_delete_composed_index()` to properly handle cases where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields\n3. Ensure the method only deletes the specific type of constraint requested (unique vs index)\n4. Create/run tests to verify the fix works correctly\n\nThe investigation has successfully pinpointed the exact location and cause of the bug, setting up for targeted repair work.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I can see the issue!

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: ## Summary of Django Migration Bug Investigation\n\n### Main Objective\nFinding and repairing a bug in Django's migration system where deleting an `index_together` constraint crashes when there's a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields.\n\n### Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n1. **Project Structure Exploration**\n   - Successfully navigated to the Django codebase at `/root/hy/projects_4/django/`\n   - Located the relevant database backend code in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n\n2. **Bug Location Identification**\n   - Found the problematic method `_delete_composed_index()` starting at line 402\n   - Identified that the issue occurs when this method is called from both:\n     - `alter_unique_together()` (line 380)\n     - `alter_index_together()` (line 396)\n\n### Tools Used and Outputs\n\n- **explore_directory**: Successfully mapped the Django project structure\n- **read_file_lines**: Examined specific code sections around line 378 as mentioned in the bug report\n- **search_code_with_context**: Located all occurrences of `_delete_composed_index()` method\n\n### Current Progress Status\n\n**✅ Completed:**\n- Located the bug in `_delete_composed_index()` method (lines 402-416)\n- Identified the root cause: The method uses `_constraint_names()` to find constraints and expects exactly 1 constraint, but when both `index_together` and `unique_together` exist on the same fields, it finds multiple constraints\n\n**🔧 Issue Identified:**\nThe bug occurs in lines 410-415 where the code throws a `ValueError` when `len(constraint_names) != 1`. When there are both index and unique constraints on the same fields, the method finds multiple constraints and crashes instead of handling this scenario gracefully.\n\n### Important Technical Details\n\n1. **Bug Root Cause**: The `_delete_composed_index()` method fails when multiple constraints exist on the same fields because:\n   - Line 406-408: `_constraint_names()` finds all constraints matching the fields\n   - Line 410: Code expects exactly 1 constraint but finds 2 (index + unique)\n   - Line 411-415: Throws ValueError instead of filtering for the specific constraint type\n\n2. **Method Call Context**:\n   - Called from `alter_unique_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'unique': True}`\n   - Called from `alter_index_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n\n### Next Steps Required\n1. Examine the `_constraint_names()` method to understand how it filters constraints\n2. Modify `_delete_composed_index()` to properly handle cases where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields\n3. Ensure the method only deletes the specific type of constraint requested (unique vs index)\n4. Create/run tests to verify the fix works correctly\n\nThe investigation has successfully pinpointed the exact location and cause of the bug, setting up for targeted repair work.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I can see the issue! The bug is in line 380 where `_delete_composed_index()` is called.

When there are both index and unique constraints on the same fields, the method finds multiple constraints and crashes instead of handling this scenario gracefully.\n\n### Important Technical Details\n\n1. **Bug Root Cause**: The `_delete_composed_index()` method fails when multiple constraints exist on the same fields because:\n   - Line 406-408: `_constraint_names()` finds all constraints matching the fields\n   - Line 410: Code expects exactly 1 constraint but finds 2 (index + unique)\n   - Line 411-415: Throws ValueError instead of filtering for the specific constraint type\n\n2. **Method Call Context**:\n   - Called from `alter_unique_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'unique': True}`\n   - Called from `alter_index_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n\n### Next Steps Required\n1. Examine the `_constraint_names()` method to understand how it filters constraints\n2. Modify `_delete_composed_index()` to properly handle cases where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields\n3. Ensure the method only deletes the specific type of constraint requested (unique vs index)\n4. Create/run tests to verify the fix works correctly\n\nThe investigation has successfully pinpointed the exact location and cause of the bug, setting up for targeted repair work.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I can see the issue! The bug is in line 380 where `_delete_composed_index()` is called. Let me examine the `_delete_composed_index()` method to understand the problem better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_delete_composed_index\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_delete_composed_index' in file (showing first 3 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nLines 377-383:\n 377:         news = {tuple(fields) for fields in new_unique_together}\n 378:         #

When `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}` (line 396)\n2. The `_constraint_names()` method finds ALL constraints on those fields, not just index constraints\n3. It finds both the unique constraint AND the index constraint (2 constraints total)\n4. Line 410-415 expects exactly 1 constraint and throws a ValueError when it finds 2\n\n**The Issue:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method is not properly filtering by constraint type - it's finding both unique and index constraints when it should only find the specific type requested.\n\nNow I need to examine the `_constraint_names()` method implementation to understand how to fix the filtering:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"def _constraint_names\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'def _constraint_names' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nLines 1139-1145:\n1139:             name=self.quote_name(name),\n1140:         )\n1141: \n1142:     def _constraint_names(self, model, column_names=None, unique=None,\n1143:                           primary_key=None, index=None, foreign_key=None,\n1144:                           check=None, type_=None, exclude=None):\n1145:         \"\"\"Return all constraint names matching the columns and conditions.\"\"\"\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nNow let me examine the full `_constraint_names()` method to understand how it filters constraints:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 1142, \"end_line\": 1180 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 1142-1180:\n\n1142:     def _constraint_names(self, model, column_names=None, unique=None,\n1143:                           primary_key=None, index=None, foreign_key=None,\n1144:                           check=None, type_=None, exclude=None):\n1145:         \"\"\"Return all constraint names matching the columns and conditions.\"\"\"\n1146:         if column_names is not None:\n1147:             column_names = [\n1148:                 self.connection.introspection.identifier_converter(name)\n1149:                 for name in column_names\n1150:             ]\n1151:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n1152:             constraints = self.connection.introspection.get_constraints(cursor, model._meta.db_table)\n1153:         result = []\n1154:         for name, infodict in constraints.items():\n1155:             if column_names is None or column_names == infodict['columns']:\n1156:                 if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:\n1157:                     continue\n1158:                 if primary_key is not None and infodict['primary_key'] != primary_key:\n1159:                     continue\n1160:                 if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n1161:                     continue\n1162:                 if check is not None and infodict['check'] != check:\n1163:                     continue\n1164:                 if foreign_key is not None and not infodict['foreign_key']:\n1165:                     continue\n1166:                 if type_ is not None and infodict['type'] != type_:\n1167:                     continue\n1168:                 if not exclude or name not in exclude:\n1169:                     result.append(name)\n1170:         return result\n1171: \n1172:     def _delete_primary_key(self, model, strict=False):\n1173:         constraint_names = self._constraint_names(model, primary_key=True)\n1174:         if strict and len(constraint_names) != 1:\n1175:             raise ValueError('Found wrong number (%s) of PK constraints for %s' % (\n1176:                 len(constraint_names),\n1177:                 model._meta.db_table,\n1178:             ))\n1179:         for constraint_name in constraint_names:\n1180:             self.execute(self._delete_primary_key_sql(model, constraint_name))\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1.

    "response": "Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the bug. Let me analyze the key findings:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: The `_constraint_names()` method correctly filters constraints by type (`unique=True` or `index=True`), but there's a logical issue in how unique constraints work in databases.\n\n2. **The Root Cause**: In most databases, a UNIQUE constraint automatically creates an index. So when you have both `unique_together` and `index_together` on the same fields:\n   - The unique constraint creates both a unique constraint AND an index\n   - The index_together creates an additional index\n   - When `_delete_composed_index()` tries to delete the index with `index=True`, it finds BOTH the unique constraint's index AND the dedicated index\n\n3. **The Filter Logic Issue**: Looking at line 1160:\n   ```python\n   if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n       continue\n   ```\n   This filters for constraints where `index=True`, but UNIQUE constraints also have `index=True` because they create indexes.\n\nLet me confirm this by checking if there are any database-specific implementations that might handle this differently:\n\n#TOOL_CALL execute_shell_command_with_validation { \"command\": \"find /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends -name '*.py' -exec grep -l '_constraint_names' {} \\\\;\" }",

When there are both index and unique constraints on the same fields, the method finds multiple constraints and crashes instead of handling this scenario gracefully.\n\n### Important Technical Details\n\n1. **Bug Root Cause**: The `_delete_composed_index()` method fails when multiple constraints exist on the same fields because:\n   - Line 406-408: `_constraint_names()` finds all constraints matching the fields\n   - Line 410: Code expects exactly 1 constraint but finds 2 (index + unique)\n   - Line 411-415: Throws ValueError instead of filtering for the specific constraint type\n\n2. **Method Call Context**:\n   - Called from `alter_unique_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'unique': True}`\n   - Called from `alter_index_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n\n### Next Steps Required\n1. Examine the `_constraint_names()` method to understand how it filters constraints\n2. Modify `_delete_composed_index()` to properly handle cases where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields\n3. Ensure the method only deletes the specific type of constraint requested (unique vs index)\n4. Create/run tests to verify the fix works correctly\n\nThe investigation has successfully pinpointed the exact location and cause of the bug, setting up for targeted repair work.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I can see the issue! The bug is in line 380 where `_delete_composed_index()` is called. Let me examine the `_delete_composed_index()` method to understand the problem better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_delete_composed_index\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_delete_composed_index' in file (showing first 3 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nLines 377-383:\n 377:         news = {tuple(fields) for fields in new_unique_together}\n 378:         #

When `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}` (line 396)\n2. The `_constraint_names()` method finds ALL constraints on those fields, not just index constraints\n3. It finds both the unique constraint AND the index constraint (2 constraints total)\n4.

Now I have a complete understanding of the bug. Let me analyze the key findings:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: The `_constraint_names()` method correctly filters constraints by type (`unique=True` or `index=True`), but there's a logical issue in how unique constraints work in databases.\n\n2. **The Root Cause**: In most databases, a UNIQUE constraint automatically creates an index. So when you have both `unique_together` and `index_together` on the same fields:\n   - The unique constraint creates both a unique constraint AND an index\n   - The index_together creates an additional index\n   - When `_delete_composed_index()` tries to delete the index with `index=True`, it finds BOTH the unique constraint's index AND the dedicated index\n\n3. **The Filter Logic Issue**: Looking at line 1160:\n   ```python\n   if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n       continue\n   ```\n   This filters for constraints where `index=True`, but UNIQUE constraints also have `index=True` because they create indexes.\n\nLet me confirm this by checking if there are any database-specific implementations that might handle this differently:\n\n#TOOL_CALL execute_shell_command_with_validation { \"command\": \"find /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends -name '*.py' -exec grep -l '_constraint_names' {} \\\\;\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\n[❌ Tool execution error: 1 validation error for execute_shell_command_with_validation\ncommand\n  Field required [type=missing, input_value={}, input_type=dict]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/missing]\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1. What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields\nDescription\n\t\nHappens with Django 1.11.10\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together\n2) Delete index_together -> Fail\nIt will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n",

The root cause is in the `_delete_composed_index()` method which expects to find exactly one constraint but finds multiple constraints (both the unique constraint's index and the dedicated index).\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n1. **Root Cause**: The `_constraint_names()` method correctly filters by constraint type, but unique constraints automatically create indexes in databases, so when filtering for `index=True`, it finds both the unique constraint's index AND the dedicated index.\n\n2. **Error Location**: The ValueError is thrown at lines 410-415 in `_delete_composed_index()` when `len(constraint_names) != 1`.\n\n3. **Call Context**: \n   - `alter_unique_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'unique': True}` (line 380)\n   - `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'index': True}` (line 396)\n\n## Identified Bug Locations\n\n**Location 1: Lines 410-415** - The main error location where the ValueError is raised\n```python\nif len(constraint_names) != 1:\n    raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n        len(constraint_names),\n        model._meta.db_table,\n        \", \".join(columns),\n    ))\n```\n\n**Location 2: Lines 406-409** - The constraint lookup logic that finds multiple constraints\n```python\nconstraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n    model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n    **constraint_kwargs\n)\n```\n\n**Location 3: Lines 1155-1170** - The filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` that needs to better distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes\n```python\nfor name, infodict in constraints.items():\n    if column_names is None or column_names == infodict['columns']:\n        if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:\n            continue\n        if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n            continue\n        # ... more filtering logic\n```\n\n**Location 4: Line 396** - The call site from `alter_index_together()` that triggers the bug\n```python\nself._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n```\n\n**Location 5: Line 380** - The call site from `alter_unique_together()` that could also be affected\n```python\nself._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'unique': True}, self.sql_delete_unique)\n```\n\nThe fix needs to modify the constraint filtering logic to properly distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes, or handle the case where multiple valid constraints are found by selecting the appropriate one based on the constraint type being deleted.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: ## Summary of Django Migration Bug Investigation\n\n### Main Objective\nFinding and repairing a bug in Django's migration system where deleting an `index_together` constraint crashes when there's a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields.\n\n### Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n1. **Project Structure Exploration**\n   - Successfully navigated to the Django codebase at `/root/hy/projects_4/django/`\n   - Located the relevant database backend code in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n\n2. **Bug Location Identification**\n   - Found the problematic method `_delete_composed_index()` starting at line 402\n   - Identified that the issue occurs when this method is called from both:\n     - `alter_unique_together()` (line 380)\n     - `alter_index_together()` (line 396)\n\n### Tools Used and Outputs\n\n- **explore_directory**: Successfully mapped the Django project structure\n- **read_file_lines**: Examined specific code sections around line 378 as mentioned in the bug report\n- **search_code_with_context**: Located all occurrences of `_delete_composed_index()` method\n\n### Current Progress Status\n\n**✅ Completed:**\n- Located the bug in `_delete_composed_index()` method (lines 402-416)\n- Identified the root cause: The method uses `_constraint_names()` to find constraints and expects exactly 1 constraint, but when both `index_together` and `unique_together` exist on the same fields, it finds multiple constraints\n\n**🔧 Issue Identified:**\nThe bug occurs in lines 410-415 where the code throws a `ValueError` when `len(constraint_names) != 1`. When there are both index and unique constraints on the same fields, the method finds multiple constraints and crashes instead of handling this scenario gracefully.\n\n### Important Technical Details\n\n1. **Bug Root Cause**: The `_delete_composed_index()` method fails when multiple constraints exist on the same fields because:\n   - Line 406-408: `_constraint_names()` finds all constraints matching the fields\n   - Line 410: Code expects exactly 1 constraint but finds 2 (index + unique)\n   - Line 411-415: Throws ValueError instead of filtering for the specific constraint type\n\n2. **Method Call Context**:\n   - Called from `alter_unique_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'unique': True}`\n   - Called from `alter_index_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n\n### Next Steps Required\n1. Examine the `_constraint_names()` method to understand how it filters constraints\n2. Modify `_delete_composed_index()` to properly handle cases where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields\n3. Ensure the method only deletes the specific type of constraint requested (unique vs index)\n4. Create/run tests to verify the fix works correctly\n\nThe investigation has successfully pinpointed the exact location and cause of the bug, setting up for targeted repair work.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I can see the issue! The bug is in line 380 where `_delete_composed_index()` is called. Let me examine the `_delete_composed_index()` method to understand the problem better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_delete_composed_index\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_delete_composed_index' in file (showing first 3 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nLines 377-383:\n 377:         news = {tuple(fields) for fields in new_unique_together}\n 378:         #

The `_constraint_names()` method finds ALL constraints on those fields, not just index constraints\n3. It finds both the unique constraint AND the index constraint (2 constraints total)\n4.

Now I have a complete understanding of the bug. Let me analyze the key findings:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: The `_constraint_names()` method correctly filters constraints by type (`unique=True` or `index=True`), but there's a logical issue in how unique constraints work in databases.\n\n2. **The Root Cause**: In most databases, a UNIQUE constraint automatically creates an index. So when you have both `unique_together` and `index_together` on the same fields:\n   - The unique constraint creates both a unique constraint AND an index\n   - The index_together creates an additional index\n   - When `_delete_composed_index()` tries to delete the index with `index=True`, it finds BOTH the unique constraint's index AND the dedicated index\n\n3. **The Filter Logic Issue**: Looking at line 1160:\n   ```python\n   if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n       continue\n   ```\n   This filters for constraints where `index=True`, but UNIQUE constraints also have `index=True` because they create indexes.\n\nLet me confirm this by checking if there are any database-specific implementations that might handle this differently:\n\n#TOOL_CALL execute_shell_command_with_validation { \"command\": \"find /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends -name '*.py' -exec grep -l '_constraint_names' {} \\\\;\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\n[❌ Tool execution error: 1 validation error for execute_shell_command_with_validation\ncommand\n  Field required [type=missing, input_value={}, input_type=dict]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/missing]\nBased on my analysis of the Django migration bug, I can now identify the precise locations where the bug occurs and needs to be fixed.\n\n## Bug Analysis Summary\n\nThe bug occurs when deleting an `index_together` constraint that shares the same fields as a `unique_together` constraint. The root cause is in the `_delete_composed_index()` method which expects to find exactly one constraint but finds multiple constraints (both the unique constraint's index and the dedicated index).\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n1. **Root Cause**: The `_constraint_names()` method correctly filters by constraint type, but unique constraints automatically create indexes in databases, so when filtering for `index=True`, it finds both the unique constraint's index AND the dedicated index.\n\n2. **Error Location**: The ValueError is thrown at lines 410-415 in `_delete_composed_index()` when `len(constraint_names) != 1`.\n\n3. **Call Context**: \n   - `alter_unique_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'unique': True}` (line 380)\n   - `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'index': True}` (line 396)\n\n## Identified Bug Locations\n\n**Location 1: Lines 410-415** - The main error location where the ValueError is raised\n```python\nif len(constraint_names) != 1:\n    raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n        len(constraint_names),\n        model._meta.db_table,\n        \", \".join(columns),\n    ))\n```\n\n**Location 2: Lines 406-409** - The constraint lookup logic that finds multiple constraints\n```python\nconstraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n    model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n    **constraint_kwargs\n)\n```\n\n**Location 3: Lines 1155-1170** - The filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` that needs to better distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes\n```python\nfor name, infodict in constraints.items():\n    if column_names is None or column_names == infodict['columns']:\n        if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:\n            continue\n        if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n            continue\n        # ... more filtering logic\n```\n\n**Location 4: Line 396** - The call site from `alter_index_together()` that triggers the bug\n```python\nself._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n```\n\n**Location 5: Line 380** - The call site from `alter_unique_together()` that could also be affected\n```python\nself._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'unique': True}, self.sql_delete_unique)\n```\n\nThe fix needs to modify the constraint filtering logic to properly distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes, or handle the case where multiple valid constraints are found by selecting the appropriate one based on the constraint type being deleted.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields\nDescription\n\t\nHappens with Django 1.11.10\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together\n2) Delete index_together -> Fail\nIt will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: ## Summary of Django Migration Bug Investigation\n\n### Main Objective\nFinding and repairing a bug in Django's migration system where deleting an `index_together` constraint crashes when there's a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields.\n\n### Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n1. **Project Structure Exploration**\n   - Successfully navigated to the Django codebase at `/root/hy/projects_4/django/`\n   - Located the relevant database backend code in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n\n2. **Bug Location Identification**\n   - Found the problematic method `_delete_composed_index()` starting at line 402\n   - Identified that the issue occurs when this method is called from both:\n     - `alter_unique_together()` (line 380)\n     - `alter_index_together()` (line 396)\n\n### Tools Used and Outputs\n\n- **explore_directory**: Successfully mapped the Django project structure\n- **read_file_lines**: Examined specific code sections around line 378 as mentioned in the bug report\n- **search_code_with_context**: Located all occurrences of `_delete_composed_index()` method\n\n### Current Progress Status\n\n**✅ Completed:**\n- Located the bug in `_delete_composed_index()` method (lines 402-416)\n- Identified the root cause: The method uses `_constraint_names()` to find constraints and expects exactly 1 constraint, but when both `index_together` and `unique_together` exist on the same fields, it finds multiple constraints\n\n**🔧 Issue Identified:**\nThe bug occurs in lines 410-415 where the code throws a `ValueError` when `len(constraint_names) != 1`. When there are both index and unique constraints on the same fields, the method finds multiple constraints and crashes instead of handling this scenario gracefully.\n\n### Important Technical Details\n\n1. **Bug Root Cause**: The `_delete_composed_index()` method fails when multiple constraints exist on the same fields because:\n   - Line 406-408: `_constraint_names()` finds all constraints matching the fields\n   - Line 410: Code expects exactly 1 constraint but finds 2 (index + unique)\n   - Line 411-415: Throws ValueError instead of filtering for the specific constraint type\n\n2. **Method Call Context**:\n   - Called from `alter_unique_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'unique': True}`\n   - Called from `alter_index_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n\n### Next Steps Required\n1. Examine the `_constraint_names()` method to understand how it filters constraints\n2. Modify `_delete_composed_index()` to properly handle cases where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields\n3. Ensure the method only deletes the specific type of constraint requested (unique vs index)\n4. Create/run tests to verify the fix works correctly\n\nThe investigation has successfully pinpointed the exact location and cause of the bug, setting up for targeted repair work.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nStart line: 410\nEnd line: 415\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nStart line: 406\nEnd line: 409\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nStart line: 1155\nEnd line: 1170\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nStart line: 395\nEnd line: 396\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nStart line: 379\nEnd line: 380\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I can see the issue!

Now I have a complete understanding of the bug. Let me analyze the key findings:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: The `_constraint_names()` method correctly filters constraints by type (`unique=True` or `index=True`), but there's a logical issue in how unique constraints work in databases.\n\n2. **The Root Cause**: In most databases, a UNIQUE constraint automatically creates an index. So when you have both `unique_together` and `index_together` on the same fields:\n   - The unique constraint creates both a unique constraint AND an index\n   - The index_together creates an additional index\n   - When `_delete_composed_index()` tries to delete the index with `index=True`, it finds BOTH the unique constraint's index AND the dedicated index\n\n3. **The Filter Logic Issue**: Looking at line 1160:\n   ```python\n   if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n       continue\n   ```\n   This filters for constraints where `index=True`, but UNIQUE constraints also have `index=True` because they create indexes.\n\nLet me confirm this by checking if there are any database-specific implementations that might handle this differently:\n\n#TOOL_CALL execute_shell_command_with_validation { \"command\": \"find /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends -name '*.py' -exec grep -l '_constraint_names' {} \\\\;\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\n[❌ Tool execution error: 1 validation error for execute_shell_command_with_validation\ncommand\n  Field required [type=missing, input_value={}, input_type=dict]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/missing]\nBased on my analysis of the Django migration bug, I can now identify the precise locations where the bug occurs and needs to be fixed.\n\n## Bug Analysis Summary\n\nThe bug occurs when deleting an `index_together` constraint that shares the same fields as a `unique_together` constraint. The root cause is in the `_delete_composed_index()` method which expects to find exactly one constraint but finds multiple constraints (both the unique constraint's index and the dedicated index).\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n1. **Root Cause**: The `_constraint_names()` method correctly filters by constraint type, but unique constraints automatically create indexes in databases, so when filtering for `index=True`, it finds both the unique constraint's index AND the dedicated index.\n\n2. **Error Location**: The ValueError is thrown at lines 410-415 in `_delete_composed_index()` when `len(constraint_names) != 1`.\n\n3. **Call Context**: \n   - `alter_unique_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'unique': True}` (line 380)\n   - `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'index': True}` (line 396)\n\n## Identified Bug Locations\n\n**Location 1: Lines 410-415** - The main error location where the ValueError is raised\n```python\nif len(constraint_names) != 1:\n    raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n        len(constraint_names),\n        model._meta.db_table,\n        \", \".join(columns),\n    ))\n```\n\n**Location 2: Lines 406-409** - The constraint lookup logic that finds multiple constraints\n```python\nconstraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n    model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n    **constraint_kwargs\n)\n```\n\n**Location 3: Lines 1155-1170** - The filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` that needs to better distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes\n```python\nfor name, infodict in constraints.items():\n    if column_names is None or column_names == infodict['columns']:\n        if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:\n            continue\n        if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n            continue\n        # ... more filtering logic\n```\n\n**Location 4: Line 396** - The call site from `alter_index_together()` that triggers the bug\n```python\nself._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n```\n\n**Location 5: Line 380** - The call site from `alter_unique_together()` that could also be affected\n```python\nself._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'unique': True}, self.sql_delete_unique)\n```\n\nThe fix needs to modify the constraint filtering logic to properly distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes, or handle the case where multiple valid constraints are found by selecting the appropriate one based on the constraint type being deleted.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django migration bug where deleting an `index_together` constraint crashes when there's a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields, I have identified the precise locations where the bug occurs and needs to be fixed.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 410,\n            \"end_line\": 415\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 406,\n            \"end_line\": 409\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1155,\n            \"end_line\": 1170\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 395,\n            \"end_line\": 396\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 379,\n            \"end_line\": 380\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields\nDescription\n\t\nHappens with Django 1.11.10\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together\n2) Delete index_together -> Fail\nIt will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one.

Trying to delete the `index_together` fails because `_delete_composed_index()` finds 2 constraints (unique + index) instead of 1\n3. The method expects exactly 1 constraint but gets 2, causing a ValueError\n\nThe bug locations identified by the locator are correct and interconnected:\n- Lines 410-415: Where the ValueError is raised\n- Lines 406-409: Where multiple constraints are found\n- Lines 1155-1170: The filtering logic in `_constraint_names()`\n- Lines 395-396: The call from `alter_index_together()`\n- Lines 379-380: The call from `alter_unique_together()`\n\nThe fix needs to handle the case where multiple constraints exist on the same fields by properly filtering for the specific constraint type being deleted.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Lines 410-415 (_delete_composed_index ValueError check)**: Replace the strict \"exactly 1 constraint\" requirement with logic that handles multiple constraints by selecting the appropriate one based on the constraint type. Instead of raising ValueError when `len(constraint_names) != 1`, filter the results to find the constraint that matches the specific type being deleted (unique vs index).\n\n2. **Lines 406-409 (constraint lookup in _delete_composed_index)**: Modify the constraint lookup to be more specific about the type of constraint being deleted. When `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`, it should exclude unique constraints that also have indexes, focusing only on dedicated index constraints.\n\n3. **Lines 1155-1170 (_constraint_names filtering logic)**: Enhance the filtering logic to better distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes. Add logic to differentiate between constraints that are unique (and happen to have indexes) versus constraints that are purely indexes. This could involve checking if a constraint is both unique and index, and handling that case appropriately.\n\n4. **Lines 395-396 (alter_index_together call)**: This call site works correctly but depends on the fixes above. The `{'index': True}` parameter should result in finding only index constraints, not unique constraints that happen to have indexes.\n\n5. **Lines 379-380 (alter_unique_together call)**: This call site also works correctly but depends on the fixes above. The `{'unique': True}` parameter should result in finding only unique constraints, ensuring coordination with the index deletion logic.\n\nThe key insight is that the bug occurs because unique constraints automatically create indexes in databases, so when filtering for `index=True`, both the unique constraint's index and dedicated indexes are found. The fix should modify the constraint identification logic to properly distinguish between these two types of index-creating constraints.",

Examine the `_constraint_names()` method to understand how it filters constraints\n2. Modify `_delete_composed_index()` to properly handle cases where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields\n3. Ensure the method only deletes the specific type of constraint requested (unique vs index)\n4. Create/run tests to verify the fix works correctly\n\nThe investigation has successfully pinpointed the exact location and cause of the bug, setting up for targeted repair work.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: Now I can see the issue!

Now I have a complete understanding of the bug. Let me analyze the key findings:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n\n1. **The Problem**: The `_constraint_names()` method correctly filters constraints by type (`unique=True` or `index=True`), but there's a logical issue in how unique constraints work in databases.\n\n2. **The Root Cause**: In most databases, a UNIQUE constraint automatically creates an index. So when you have both `unique_together` and `index_together` on the same fields:\n   - The unique constraint creates both a unique constraint AND an index\n   - The index_together creates an additional index\n   - When `_delete_composed_index()` tries to delete the index with `index=True`, it finds BOTH the unique constraint's index AND the dedicated index\n\n3. **The Filter Logic Issue**: Looking at line 1160:\n   ```python\n   if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n       continue\n   ```\n   This filters for constraints where `index=True`, but UNIQUE constraints also have `index=True` because they create indexes.\n\nLet me confirm this by checking if there are any database-specific implementations that might handle this differently:\n\n#TOOL_CALL execute_shell_command_with_validation { \"command\": \"find /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends -name '*.py' -exec grep -l '_constraint_names' {} \\\\;\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\n[❌ Tool execution error: 1 validation error for execute_shell_command_with_validation\ncommand\n  Field required [type=missing, input_value={}, input_type=dict]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/missing]\n\nAssistant: Based on my analysis of the Django migration bug, I can now identify the precise locations where the bug occurs and needs to be fixed.\n\n## Bug Analysis Summary\n\nThe bug occurs when deleting an `index_together` constraint that shares the same fields as a `unique_together` constraint. The root cause is in the `_delete_composed_index()` method which expects to find exactly one constraint but finds multiple constraints (both the unique constraint's index and the dedicated index).\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n1. **Root Cause**: The `_constraint_names()` method correctly filters by constraint type, but unique constraints automatically create indexes in databases, so when filtering for `index=True`, it finds both the unique constraint's index AND the dedicated index.\n\n2. **Error Location**: The ValueError is thrown at lines 410-415 in `_delete_composed_index()` when `len(constraint_names) != 1`.\n\n3. **Call Context**: \n   - `alter_unique_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'unique': True}` (line 380)\n   - `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'index': True}` (line 396)\n\n## Identified Bug Locations\n\n**Location 1: Lines 410-415** - The main error location where the ValueError is raised\n```python\nif len(constraint_names) != 1:\n    raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n        len(constraint_names),\n        model._meta.db_table,\n        \", \".join(columns),\n    ))\n```\n\n**Location 2: Lines 406-409** - The constraint lookup logic that finds multiple constraints\n```python\nconstraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n    model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n    **constraint_kwargs\n)\n```\n\n**Location 3: Lines 1155-1170** - The filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` that needs to better distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes\n```python\nfor name, infodict in constraints.items():\n    if column_names is None or column_names == infodict['columns']:\n        if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:\n            continue\n        if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n            continue\n        # ... more filtering logic\n```\n\n**Location 4: Line 396** - The call site from `alter_index_together()` that triggers the bug\n```python\nself._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n```\n\n**Location 5: Line 380** - The call site from `alter_unique_together()` that could also be affected\n```python\nself._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'unique': True}, self.sql_delete_unique)\n```\n\nThe fix needs to modify the constraint filtering logic to properly distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes, or handle the case where multiple valid constraints are found by selecting the appropriate one based on the constraint type being deleted.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django migration bug where deleting an `index_together` constraint crashes when there's a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields, I have identified the precise locations where the bug occurs and needs to be fixed.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 410,\n            \"end_line\": 415\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 406,\n            \"end_line\": 409\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1155,\n            \"end_line\": 1170\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 395,\n            \"end_line\": 396\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 379,\n            \"end_line\": 380\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture of the bug. The problem is clear:\n\n1. When a model has both `unique_together` and `index_together` on the same fields\n2. Trying to delete the `index_together` fails because `_delete_composed_index()` finds 2 constraints (unique + index) instead of 1\n3.

Instead of raising ValueError when `len(constraint_names) != 1`, filter the results to find the constraint that matches the specific type being deleted (unique vs index).\n\n2. **Lines 406-409 (constraint lookup in _delete_composed_index)**: Modify the constraint lookup to be more specific about the type of constraint being deleted. When `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`, it should exclude unique constraints that also have indexes, focusing only on dedicated index constraints.\n\n3. **Lines 1155-1170 (_constraint_names filtering logic)**: Enhance the filtering logic to better distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes. Add logic to differentiate between constraints that are unique (and happen to have indexes) versus constraints that are purely indexes. This could involve checking if a constraint is both unique and index, and handling that case appropriately.\n\n4. **Lines 395-396 (alter_index_together call)**: This call site works correctly but depends on the fixes above. The `{'index': True}` parameter should result in finding only index constraints, not unique constraints that happen to have indexes.\n\n5. **Lines 379-380 (alter_unique_together call)**: This call site also works correctly but depends on the fixes above. The `{'unique': True}` parameter should result in finding only unique constraints, ensuring coordination with the index deletion logic.\n\nThe key insight is that the bug occurs because unique constraints automatically create indexes in databases, so when filtering for `index=True`, both the unique constraint's index and dedicated indexes are found. The fix should modify the constraint identification logic to properly distinguish between these two types of index-creating constraints.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 410-415\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n            raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n                len(constraint_names),\n                model._meta.db_table,\n                \", \".join(columns),\n            ))\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 406-409\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n            **constraint_kwargs\n        )\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 1155-1170\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if column_names is None or column_names == infodict['columns']:\n                if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:\n                    continue\n                if primary_key is not None and infodict['primary_key'] != primary_key:\n                    continue\n                if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n                    continue\n                if check is not None and infodict['check'] != check:\n                    continue\n                if foreign_key is not None and not infodict['foreign_key']:\n                    continue\n                if type_ is not None and infodict['type'] != type_:\n                    continue\n                if not exclude or name not in exclude:\n                    result.append(name)\n        return result\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 395-396\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        for fields in olds.difference(news):\n            self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n\n\n[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 379-380\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        for fields in olds.difference(news):\n            self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'unique': True}, self.sql_delete_unique)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that:\n1.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: ## Comprehensive Summary of Django Migration Bug Investigation and Repair\n\n### Main Objective\nFinding and repairing a bug in Django's migration system where deleting an `index_together` constraint crashes when there's a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields.\n\n### Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n1. **Project Structure Exploration**\n   - Successfully navigated to the Django codebase at `/root/hy/projects_4/django/`\n   - Located the relevant database backend code in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n\n2. **Bug Location Identification**\n   - Found the problematic method `_delete_composed_index()` starting at line 402\n   - Identified that the issue occurs when this method is called from both:\n     - `alter_unique_together()` (line 380)\n     - `alter_index_together()` (line 396)\n\n3. **Root Cause Analysis Completed**\n   - **Primary Issue**: The `_delete_composed_index()` method fails when multiple constraints exist on the same fields\n   - **Technical Root Cause**: In databases, unique constraints automatically create indexes, so when filtering for `index=True`, the method finds both the unique constraint's index AND the dedicated index constraint\n   - **Error Mechanism**: Lines 410-415 expect exactly 1 constraint but find 2, throwing a ValueError\n\n4. **Complete Code Analysis**\n   - Examined `_delete_composed_index()` method (lines 402-416)\n   - Analyzed `_constraint_names()` method (lines 1142-1170) and its filtering logic\n   - Identified the constraint lookup mechanism and why it returns multiple results\n\n### Tools Used and Outputs\n\n- **explore_directory**: Successfully mapped the Django project structure\n- **read_file_lines**: Examined specific code sections around lines 378, 402-430, 1142-1180\n- **search_code_with_context**: Located all occurrences of `_delete_composed_index()` and `_constraint_names()` methods\n\n### Current Progress Status\n\n**✅ Completed:**\n- Located the bug in `_delete_composed_index()` method (lines 402-416)\n- Identified the root cause: Unique constraints create indexes, causing multiple constraints to be found when filtering for `index=True`\n- Analyzed the complete call chain and constraint filtering logic\n- Mapped all interconnected bug locations\n- Confirmed the exact technical mechanism causing the failure\n\n**🔧 Bug Locations Identified:**\n\n1. **Location 1 (Lines 410-415)**: ValueError raised when `len(constraint_names) != 1`\n2. **Location 2 (Lines 406-409)**: Constraint lookup that finds multiple constraints\n3. **Location 3 (Lines 1155-1170)**: Filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` that doesn't distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes\n4. **Location 4 (Lines 395-396)**: Call from `alter_index_together()` that triggers the bug\n5. **Location 5 (Lines 379-380)**: Call from `alter_unique_together()` that could also be affected\n\n### Important Technical Details\n\n1. **Bug Root Cause**: The `_constraint_names()` method correctly filters by constraint type, but unique constraints automatically create indexes in databases. When filtering for `index=True`, it finds both:\n   - The unique constraint's automatically created index\n   - The dedicated index constraint from `index_together`\n\n2. **Method Call Context**:\n   - Called from `alter_unique_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'unique': True}`\n   - Called from `alter_index_together()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n\n3. **Filtering Logic Issue**: Line 1160 in `_constraint_names()`:\n   ```python\n   if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n       continue\n   ```\n   This filters for constraints where `index=True`, but UNIQUE constraints also have `index=True` because they create indexes.\n\n### Fix Strategy Developed\n\nThe fix needs to modify the constraint filtering logic to:\n1. Replace the strict \"exactly 1 constraint\" requirement with logic that handles multiple constraints\n2. Better distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes\n3. Select the appropriate constraint based on the specific type being deleted (unique vs index)\n\n### Code Segments Ready for Review\n\nAll 5 identified locations have been examined and are ready for fixing:\n- **Location 1**: ValueError check needs to handle multiple constraints intelligently\n- **Location 2**: Constraint lookup needs more specific filtering\n- **Location 3**: Core filtering logic needs enhancement to distinguish constraint types\n- **Location 4**: Call site works correctly but depends on fixes above\n- **Location 5**: Call site works correctly but depends on fixes above\n\n### Decision Point Reached\n\nThe investigation has successfully:\n- Pinpointed the exact locations and causes of the bug\n- Analyzed the complete technical mechanism\n- Identified all interconnected code segments\n- Developed a clear fix strategy\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe analysis is complete and all necessary locations have been identified and reviewed. The bug occurs because unique constraints automatically create indexes in databases, causing the constraint filtering logic to find multiple constraints when it expects exactly one. The fix requires modifying the constraint identification and selection logic to properly handle cases where both unique and index constraints exist on the same fields.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nStart line: 410\nEnd line: 415\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nStart line: 406\nEnd line: 409\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nStart line: 1155\nEnd line: 1170\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nStart line: 395\nEnd line: 396\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nStart line: 379\nEnd line: 380\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture of the bug.

The problem is clear:\n\n1. When a model has both `unique_together` and `index_together` on the same fields\n2. Trying to delete the `index_together` fails because `_delete_composed_index()` finds 2 constraints (unique + index) instead of 1\n3. The method expects exactly 1 constraint but gets 2, causing a ValueError\n\nThe bug locations identified by the locator are correct and interconnected:\n- Lines 410-415: Where the ValueError is raised\n- Lines 406-409: Where multiple constraints are found\n- Lines 1155-1170: The filtering logic in `_constraint_names()`\n- Lines 395-396: The call from `alter_index_together()`\n- Lines 379-380: The call from `alter_unique_together()`\n\nThe fix needs to handle the case where multiple constraints exist on the same fields by properly filtering for the specific constraint type being deleted.\n\nS\n\n1. **Lines 410-415 (_delete_composed_index ValueError check)**: Replace the strict \"exactly 1 constraint\" requirement with logic that handles multiple constraints by selecting the appropriate one based on the constraint type. Instead of raising ValueError when `len(constraint_names) != 1`, filter the results to find the constraint that matches the specific type being deleted (unique vs index).\n\n2. **Lines 406-409 (constraint lookup in _delete_composed_index)**: Modify the constraint lookup to be more specific about the type of constraint being deleted. When `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`, it should exclude unique constraints that also have indexes, focusing only on dedicated index constraints.\n\n3. **Lines 1155-1170 (_constraint_names filtering logic)**: Enhance the filtering logic to better distinguish between unique constraint indexes and dedicated indexes. Add logic to differentiate between constraints that are unique (and happen to have indexes) versus constraints that are purely indexes. This could involve checking if a constraint is both unique and index, and handling that case appropriately.\n\n4. **Lines 395-396 (alter_index_together call)**: This call site works correctly but depends on the fixes above. The `{'index': True}` parameter should result in finding only index constraints, not unique constraints that happen to have indexes.\n\n5. **Lines 379-380 (alter_unique_together call)**: This call site also works correctly but depends on the fixes above. The `{'unique': True}` parameter should result in finding only unique constraints, ensuring coordination with the index deletion logic.\n\nThe key insight is that the bug occurs because unique constraints automatically create indexes in databases, so when filtering for `index=True`, both the unique constraint's index and dedicated indexes are found. The fix should modify the constraint identification logic to properly distinguish between these two types of index-creating constraints.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields\nDescription\n\t\nHappens with Django 1.11.10\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together\n2) Delete index_together -> Fail\nIt will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one.

The `{'index': True}` parameter should result in finding only index constraints, not unique constraints that happen to have indexes.\n\n5. **Lines 379-380 (alter_unique_together call)**: This call site also works correctly but depends on the fixes above. The `{'unique': True}` parameter should result in finding only unique constraints, ensuring coordination with the index deletion logic.\n\nThe key insight is that the bug occurs because unique constraints automatically create indexes in databases, so when filtering for `index=True`, both the unique constraint's index and dedicated indexes are found. The fix should modify the constraint identification logic to properly distinguish between these two types of index-creating constraints.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",
