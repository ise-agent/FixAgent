What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",

What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",

What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",

What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug clearly! The issue is in how the `register_hook` method handles the hooks parameter during Request initialization. \n\n**Current Problem:**\n1. In `Request.__init__()` (line 152), when processing the hooks dictionary: `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)`\n2.

The issue is in how the `register_hook` method handles the hooks parameter during Request initialization. \n\n**Current Problem:**\n1. In `Request.__init__()` (line 152), when processing the hooks dictionary: `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)`\n2. If `v` is a list of hook functions, `register_hook` simply appends the entire list as a single item: `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`\n3. This results in `self.hooks[event] = [list_of_hooks]` instead of `self.hooks[event] = list_of_hooks`\n4. Later when hooks are consumed, the code tries to call the list as if it were a function, which fails\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n- If a single hook function is passed, it should be appended normally\n- If a list of hook functions is passed, each function in the list should be registered individually\n\n**Bug Location:**\nThe bug is in the `register_hook` method at line 466. It needs to check if the `hook` parameter is a list and handle it appropriately.\n\nLet me examine the hooks initialization code to see the full context of how hooks are processed.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\", \"start_line\": 143, \"end_line\": 155 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nTotal lines: 888\nShowing lines 143-155:\n\n 143:         #: Event-handling hooks.\n 144:         self.hooks = {}\n 145: \n 146:         for event in HOOKS:\n 147:             self.hooks[event] = []\n 148: \n 149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n 150: \n 151:         for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n 152:             self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n 153: \n 154:         #: Session.\n 155:         self.session = session\n\nPerfect!

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: ## Summary: Bug Investigation in Requests Library\n\n### Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the requests project, specifically related to the hooks argument in the Request class.\n\n### Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n1. **Project Structure Exploration**\n   - Explored the main project directory `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/`\n   - Identified the core `requests/` module containing the main codebase\n   - Located key files including `models.py` where the Request class is defined\n\n2. **Request Class Analysis**\n   - Found the Request class in `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py`\n   - Examined the `__init__` method (lines 48-67) which accepts a `hooks` parameter\n   - Analyzed the hooks initialization process (lines 143-152)\n\n3. **Hook Processing Investigation**\n   - Discovered the hooks initialization logic:\n     ```python\n     # Lines 144-147: Initialize empty hooks dictionary\n     self.hooks = {}\n     for event in HOOKS:\n         self.hooks[event] = []\n     \n     # Lines 149-152: Process provided hooks\n     hooks = hooks or {}\n     for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n         self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n     ```\n\n4. **register_hook Method Analysis**\n   - Located the `register_hook` method at line 463\n   - Current implementation is simple: `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`\n\n### Bug Identification\nThe bug appears to be in the hook registration process. The current `register_hook` method (line 466) simply appends hooks without proper validation or handling of different hook types. The method lacks:\n- Validation that the event exists in the HOOKS list\n- Proper handling of callable vs non-callable hooks\n- Error handling for invalid hook registrations\n\n### Current Progress Status\n- ✅ Successfully located the Request class and hooks-related code\n- ✅ Identified the hooks initialization and registration flow\n- ✅ Found the `register_hook` method implementation\n- ⚠️ **Bug identified but not yet fixed**\n\n### Technical Details Discovered\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py`\n- **Key Methods**: \n  - `Request.__init__()` (lines 48-177)\n  - `register_hook()` (lines 463-466)\n  - `deregister_hook()` (lines 468-477)\n- **Hook Structure**: Hooks are stored as `self.hooks[event] = []` where events come from the `HOOKS` constant\n- **Dependencies**: The code imports `HOOKS` from `.hooks` module (line 15)\n\n### Next Steps Required\n1. Examine the `hooks.py` file to understand the `HOOKS` constant and expected hook structure\n2. Identify the specific bug in the `register_hook` method\n3. Implement proper validation and error handling\n4. Test the fix to ensure it resolves the issue\n\n### Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: To navigate project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: To examine specific code sections\n- `search_code_with_context`: To locate the `register_hook` method usage\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the location and structure of the hooks system, with the bug likely being in the `register_hook` method's lack of proper validation or handling of edge cases.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I need to find the register_hook method to understand how it currently works and what the bug is.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"register_hook\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'register_hook' in file (showing first 3 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 149-155:\n 149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n 150: \n 151:         for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n 152:             self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n 153: \n 154:         #: Session.\n 155:         self.session = session\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 460-466:\n 460: \n 461:         return ''.join(url)\n 462: \n 463:     def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n 464:         \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n 465: \n 466:         self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 465-471:\n 465: \n 466:         self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n 467: \n 468:     def deregister_hook(self, event, hook):\n 469:         \"\"\"Deregister a previously registered hook.\n 470:         Returns True if the hook existed, False if not.\n 471:         \"\"\"\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nNow I can see the bug clearly!

Later, when `dispatch_hook` tries to call each hook, it fails because it tries to call a list as if it were a function.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe `register_hook` method at line 466 simply does `self.hooks[event].append(hook)` without checking if `hook` is a list of functions that should be registered individually.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe `register_hook` method needs to be modified to detect when `hook` is a list/iterable of functions and register each function individually.\n\n## Bug Locations\n\nBased on my investigation, here are the precise locations where the bug manifests:\n\n1. **Primary Bug Location - register_hook method**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py` lines **463-466**\n   - This is where the core bug exists - the method doesn't handle lists of hooks properly\n\n2. **Hook Processing in Request.__init__**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py` lines **149-152**  \n   - This is where the hooks dictionary is processed and calls register_hook, triggering the bug when lists are passed\n\n3. **Hook Consumption in dispatch_hook**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/hooks.py` lines **43-44**\n   - This is where the bug manifests as a runtime error when trying to call a list as a function\n\nThese three locations are functionally connected:\n- Location 2 processes the hooks parameter and calls register_hook\n- Location 1 incorrectly handles list values by appending the entire list as one item\n- Location 3 fails when trying to execute the incorrectly stored hooks\n\nThe fix needs to be implemented primarily in location 1 (the register_hook method) to properly handle both single functions and lists of functions.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**",

The issue is in how the `register_hook` method handles the hooks parameter during Request initialization. \n\n**Current Problem:**\n1. In `Request.__init__()` (line 152), when processing the hooks dictionary: `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)`\n2. If `v` is a list of hook functions, `register_hook` simply appends the entire list as a single item: `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`\n3. This results in `self.hooks[event] = [list_of_hooks]` instead of `self.hooks[event] = list_of_hooks`\n4. Later when hooks are consumed, the code tries to call the list as if it were a function, which fails\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n- If a single hook function is passed, it should be appended normally\n- If a list of hook functions is passed, each function in the list should be registered individually\n\n**Bug Location:**\nThe bug is in the `register_hook` method at line 466. It needs to check if the `hook` parameter is a list and handle it appropriately.\n\nLet me examine the hooks initialization code to see the full context of how hooks are processed.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\", \"start_line\": 143, \"end_line\": 155 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nTotal lines: 888\nShowing lines 143-155:\n\n 143:         #: Event-handling hooks.\n 144:         self.hooks = {}\n 145: \n 146:         for event in HOOKS:\n 147:             self.hooks[event] = []\n 148: \n 149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n 150: \n 151:         for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n 152:             self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n 153: \n 154:         #: Session.\n 155:         self.session = session\n\nPerfect!

Now I have complete understanding of the bug. Based on my analysis, I can identify the precise locations where the bug manifests and needs to be fixed.\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**The Problem:**\nThe `register_hook` method in the Request class doesn't properly handle when a list of hook functions is passed. Currently, if you pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}`, the code treats the entire list `[func1, func2]` as a single hook and appends it to `self.hooks['response']`, resulting in `self.hooks['response'] = [[func1, func2]]`. Later, when `dispatch_hook` tries to call each hook, it fails because it tries to call a list as if it were a function.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe `register_hook` method at line 466 simply does `self.hooks[event].append(hook)` without checking if `hook` is a list of functions that should be registered individually.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe `register_hook` method needs to be modified to detect when `hook` is a list/iterable of functions and register each function individually.\n\n## Bug Locations\n\nBased on my investigation, here are the precise locations where the bug manifests:\n\n1. **Primary Bug Location - register_hook method**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py` lines **463-466**\n   - This is where the core bug exists - the method doesn't handle lists of hooks properly\n\n2. **Hook Processing in Request.__init__**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py` lines **149-152**  \n   - This is where the hooks dictionary is processed and calls register_hook, triggering the bug when lists are passed\n\n3. **Hook Consumption in dispatch_hook**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/hooks.py` lines **43-44**\n   - This is where the bug manifests as a runtime error when trying to call a list as a function\n\nThese three locations are functionally connected:\n- Location 2 processes the hooks parameter and calls register_hook\n- Location 1 incorrectly handles list values by appending the entire list as one item\n- Location 3 fails when trying to execute the incorrectly stored hooks\n\nThe fix needs to be implemented primarily in location 1 (the register_hook method) to properly handle both single functions and lists of functions.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list. It must follow the following structure:  example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/viewcode.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 181,\n            \"end_line\": 276\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/viewcode.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 160,\n            \"end_line\": 178\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n                ",
    "response": "**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my thorough investigation, I have identified the root cause of the bug described in the problem statement. The issue is that the `register_hook` method doesn't properly handle when a list of hook functions is passed in the hooks dictionary during Request initialization.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. When `Request.__init__()` processes the hooks parameter, it calls `register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each key-value pair\n2. If `v` is a list of functions (e.g., `[func1, func2]`), the current `register_hook` method simply appends the entire list as a single item: `self.hooks[event].append([func1, func2])`\n3. This results in `self.hooks[event] = [[func1, func2]]` instead of the expected `self.hooks[event] = [func1, func2]`\n4. Later, when `dispatch_hook` tries to iterate and call each hook, it fails because it tries to call a list as a function\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `register_hook` method needs to be modified to detect when the `hook` parameter is a list/iterable and register each function individually.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 463,\n            \"end_line\": 466\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 149,\n            \"end_line\": 152\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",

Now I have complete understanding of the bug. Based on my analysis, I can identify the precise locations where the bug manifests and needs to be fixed.\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**The Problem:**\nThe `register_hook` method in the Request class doesn't properly handle when a list of hook functions is passed. Currently, if you pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}`, the code treats the entire list `[func1, func2]` as a single hook and appends it to `self.hooks['response']`, resulting in `self.hooks['response'] = [[func1, func2]]`. Later, when `dispatch_hook` tries to call each hook, it fails because it tries to call a list as if it were a function.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe `register_hook` method at line 466 simply does `self.hooks[event].append(hook)` without checking if `hook` is a list of functions that should be registered individually.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe `register_hook` method needs to be modified to detect when `hook` is a list/iterable of functions and register each function individually.\n\n## Bug Locations\n\nBased on my investigation, here are the precise locations where the bug manifests:\n\n1. **Primary Bug Location - register_hook method**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py` lines **463-466**\n   - This is where the core bug exists - the method doesn't handle lists of hooks properly\n\n2. **Hook Processing in Request.__init__**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py` lines **149-152**  \n   - This is where the hooks dictionary is processed and calls register_hook, triggering the bug when lists are passed\n\n3. **Hook Consumption in dispatch_hook**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/hooks.py` lines **43-44**\n   - This is where the bug manifests as a runtime error when trying to call a list as a function\n\nThese three locations are functionally connected:\n- Location 2 processes the hooks parameter and calls register_hook\n- Location 1 incorrectly handles list values by appending the entire list as one item\n- Location 3 fails when trying to execute the incorrectly stored hooks\n\nThe fix needs to be implemented primarily in location 1 (the register_hook method) to properly handle both single functions and lists of functions.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n**PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my thorough investigation, I have identified the root cause of the bug described in the problem statement. The issue is that the `register_hook` method doesn't properly handle when a list of hook functions is passed in the hooks dictionary during Request initialization.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. When `Request.__init__()` processes the hooks parameter, it calls `register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each key-value pair\n2. If `v` is a list of functions (e.g., `[func1, func2]`), the current `register_hook` method simply appends the entire list as a single item: `self.hooks[event].append([func1, func2])`\n3. This results in `self.hooks[event] = [[func1, func2]]` instead of the expected `self.hooks[event] = [func1, func2]`\n4. Later, when `dispatch_hook` tries to iterate and call each hook, it fails because it tries to call a list as a function\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `register_hook` method needs to be modified to detect when the `hook` parameter is a list/iterable and register each function individually.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 463,\n            \"end_line\": 466\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 149,\n            \"end_line\": 152\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",
    "response": "Perfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem statement confirms my analysis - the bug is that the Request class doesn't properly handle lists of hook functions in the hooks dictionary parameter.\n\n**PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS**\n\nBased on my investigation of the interconnected bug locations, here are my repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Bug location 1 - register_hook method (lines 463-466)]**: Modify the `register_hook` method to properly handle both single functions and lists of functions:\n   ```python\n   def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n       \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n       # Handle both single hooks and lists of hooks\n       if hasattr(hook, '__iter__') and not hasattr(hook, '__call__'):\n           # It's a list/iterable of hooks\n           for h in hook:\n               self.hooks[event].append(h)\n       else:\n           # It's a single hook function\n           self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n   ```\n   This change enables the method to detect when `hook` is a list and register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single functions.\n\n2. **[Bug location 2 - Hook processing in __init__ (lines 149-152)]**: The existing code can remain unchanged since it properly calls `register_hook` for each key-value pair. The fix in location 1 will handle the list processing automatically when called from here. This maintains the clean separation of concerns where `__init__` handles dictionary iteration and `register_hook` handles the actual registration logic.\n\n**How these fixes work together:**\n- Location 2 continues to iterate through the hooks dictionary and call `register_hook` for each event-hook pair\n- Location 1 (the enhanced `register_hook` method) now intelligently handles both single functions and lists of functions\n- This allows users to pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}` and have both functions properly registered\n- The fix maintains backward compatibility for existing code that passes single functions\n- The enhanced `register_hook` method can also be used directly for programmatic hook registration with lists\n\nThis solution directly addresses the problem statement by allowing lists as values in the hooks dictionary while preserving all existing functionality.",

The current `register_hook` method (line 466) simply appends hooks without proper validation or handling of different hook types. The method lacks:\n- Validation that the event exists in the HOOKS list\n- Proper handling of callable vs non-callable hooks\n- Error handling for invalid hook registrations\n\n### Current Progress Status\n- ✅ Successfully located the Request class and hooks-related code\n- ✅ Identified the hooks initialization and registration flow\n- ✅ Found the `register_hook` method implementation\n- ⚠️ **Bug identified but not yet fixed**\n\n### Technical Details Discovered\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py`\n- **Key Methods**: \n  - `Request.__init__()` (lines 48-177)\n  - `register_hook()` (lines 463-466)\n  - `deregister_hook()` (lines 468-477)\n- **Hook Structure**: Hooks are stored as `self.hooks[event] = []` where events come from the `HOOKS` constant\n- **Dependencies**: The code imports `HOOKS` from `.hooks` module (line 15)\n\n### Next Steps Required\n1. Examine the `hooks.py` file to understand the `HOOKS` constant and expected hook structure\n2. Identify the specific bug in the `register_hook` method\n3. Implement proper validation and error handling\n4. Test the fix to ensure it resolves the issue\n\n### Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: To navigate project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: To examine specific code sections\n- `search_code_with_context`: To locate the `register_hook` method usage\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the location and structure of the hooks system, with the bug likely being in the `register_hook` method's lack of proper validation or handling of edge cases.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: Now I need to find the register_hook method to understand how it currently works and what the bug is.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"register_hook\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'register_hook' in file (showing first 3 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 149-155:\n 149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n 150: \n 151:         for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n 152:             self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n 153: \n 154:         #: Session.\n 155:         self.session = session\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 460-466:\n 460: \n 461:         return ''.join(url)\n 462: \n 463:     def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n 464:         \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n 465: \n 466:         self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 465-471:\n 465: \n 466:         self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n 467: \n 468:     def deregister_hook(self, event, hook):\n 469:         \"\"\"Deregister a previously registered hook.\n 470:         Returns True if the hook existed, False if not.\n 471:         \"\"\"\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: Now I can see the bug clearly!

Now I have complete understanding of the bug. Based on my analysis, I can identify the precise locations where the bug manifests and needs to be fixed.\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**The Problem:**\nThe `register_hook` method in the Request class doesn't properly handle when a list of hook functions is passed. Currently, if you pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}`, the code treats the entire list `[func1, func2]` as a single hook and appends it to `self.hooks['response']`, resulting in `self.hooks['response'] = [[func1, func2]]`. Later, when `dispatch_hook` tries to call each hook, it fails because it tries to call a list as if it were a function.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe `register_hook` method at line 466 simply does `self.hooks[event].append(hook)` without checking if `hook` is a list of functions that should be registered individually.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe `register_hook` method needs to be modified to detect when `hook` is a list/iterable of functions and register each function individually.\n\n## Bug Locations\n\nBased on my investigation, here are the precise locations where the bug manifests:\n\n1. **Primary Bug Location - register_hook method**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py` lines **463-466**\n   - This is where the core bug exists - the method doesn't handle lists of hooks properly\n\n2. **Hook Processing in Request.__init__**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py` lines **149-152**  \n   - This is where the hooks dictionary is processed and calls register_hook, triggering the bug when lists are passed\n\n3. **Hook Consumption in dispatch_hook**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/hooks.py` lines **43-44**\n   - This is where the bug manifests as a runtime error when trying to call a list as a function\n\nThese three locations are functionally connected:\n- Location 2 processes the hooks parameter and calls register_hook\n- Location 1 incorrectly handles list values by appending the entire list as one item\n- Location 3 fails when trying to execute the incorrectly stored hooks\n\nThe fix needs to be implemented primarily in location 1 (the register_hook method) to properly handle both single functions and lists of functions.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: **PROPOSE LOCATION**\n\nBased on my thorough investigation, I have identified the root cause of the bug described in the problem statement. The issue is that the `register_hook` method doesn't properly handle when a list of hook functions is passed in the hooks dictionary during Request initialization.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. When `Request.__init__()` processes the hooks parameter, it calls `register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each key-value pair\n2. If `v` is a list of functions (e.g., `[func1, func2]`), the current `register_hook` method simply appends the entire list as a single item: `self.hooks[event].append([func1, func2])`\n3. This results in `self.hooks[event] = [[func1, func2]]` instead of the expected `self.hooks[event] = [func1, func2]`\n4. Later, when `dispatch_hook` tries to iterate and call each hook, it fails because it tries to call a list as a function\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `register_hook` method needs to be modified to detect when the `hook` parameter is a list/iterable and register each function individually.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 463,\n            \"end_line\": 466\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 149,\n            \"end_line\": 152\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nAssistant: Perfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem statement confirms my analysis - the bug is that the Request class doesn't properly handle lists of hook functions in the hooks dictionary parameter.\n\n**PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS**\n\nBased on my investigation of the interconnected bug locations, here are my repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Bug location 1 - register_hook method (lines 463-466)]**: Modify the `register_hook` method to properly handle both single functions and lists of functions:\n   ```python\n   def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n       \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n       # Handle both single hooks and lists of hooks\n       if hasattr(hook, '__iter__') and not hasattr(hook, '__call__'):\n           # It's a list/iterable of hooks\n           for h in hook:\n               self.hooks[event].append(h)\n       else:\n           # It's a single hook function\n           self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n   ```\n   This change enables the method to detect when `hook` is a list and register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single functions.\n\n2. **[Bug location 2 - Hook processing in __init__ (lines 149-152)]**: The existing code can remain unchanged since it properly calls `register_hook` for each key-value pair. The fix in location 1 will handle the list processing automatically when called from here. This maintains the clean separation of concerns where `__init__` handles dictionary iteration and `register_hook` handles the actual registration logic.\n\n**How these fixes work together:**\n- Location 2 continues to iterate through the hooks dictionary and call `register_hook` for each event-hook pair\n- Location 1 (the enhanced `register_hook` method) now intelligently handles both single functions and lists of functions\n- This allows users to pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}` and have both functions properly registered\n- The fix maintains backward compatibility for existing code that passes single functions\n- The enhanced `register_hook` method can also be used directly for programmatic hook registration with lists\n\nThis solution directly addresses the problem statement by allowing lists as values in the hooks dictionary while preserving all existing functionality.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py lines 463-466\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n        \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n\n        self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py lines 149-152\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        hooks = hooks or {}\n\n        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that:\n1. Retains all key information from the previous summary\n2. Incorporates important details from the new messages above\n3. Focuses on concrete actions taken, results achieved, and current status\n4. Highlights any errors, solutions, or important decisions made\n5. Maintains chronological context where relevant\n\nYour summary should be detailed enough to allow continuation of the task without losing important context.",

Later, when `dispatch_hook` tries to iterate and call each hook, it fails because it tries to call a list as a function\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `register_hook` method needs to be modified to detect when the `hook` parameter is a list/iterable and register each function individually.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 463,\n            \"end_line\": 466\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 149,\n            \"end_line\": 152\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPerfect! Now I have the complete context. The problem statement confirms my analysis - the bug is that the Request class doesn't properly handle lists of hook functions in the hooks dictionary parameter.\n\n**PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS**\n\nBased on my investigation of the interconnected bug locations, here are my repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Bug location 1 - register_hook method (lines 463-466)]**: Modify the `register_hook` method to properly handle both single functions and lists of functions:\n   ```python\n   def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n       \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n       # Handle both single hooks and lists of hooks\n       if hasattr(hook, '__iter__') and not hasattr(hook, '__call__'):\n           # It's a list/iterable of hooks\n           for h in hook:\n               self.hooks[event].append(h)\n       else:\n           # It's a single hook function\n           self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n   ```\n   This change enables the method to detect when `hook` is a list and register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single functions.\n\n2. **[Bug location 2 - Hook processing in __init__ (lines 149-152)]**: The existing code can remain unchanged since it properly calls `register_hook` for each key-value pair. The fix in location 1 will handle the list processing automatically when called from here. This maintains the clean separation of concerns where `__init__` handles dictionary iteration and `register_hook` handles the actual registration logic.\n\n**How these fixes work together:**\n- Location 2 continues to iterate through the hooks dictionary and call `register_hook` for each event-hook pair\n- Location 1 (the enhanced `register_hook` method) now intelligently handles both single functions and lists of functions\n- This allows users to pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}` and have both functions properly registered\n- The fix maintains backward compatibility for existing code that passes single functions\n- The enhanced `register_hook` method can also be used directly for programmatic hook registration with lists\n\nThis solution directly addresses the problem statement by allowing lists as values in the hooks dictionary while preserving all existing functionality.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py lines 463-466\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n        \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n\n        self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py lines 149-152\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        hooks = hooks or {}\n\n        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nLooking at the provided code segments and the problem statement, I can see:\n\n1. **Location 1 (register_hook method)**: Currently just does `self.hooks[event].append(hook)` without checking if `hook` is a list or single function. This is the core issue - when a list is passed, it appends the entire list as one item.\n\n2. **Location 2 (hook processing in __init__)**: Iterates through the hooks dictionary and calls `register_hook` for each key-value pair. This part is working correctly.\n\nThe problem is clear: when someone passes `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}`, the current `register_hook` method appends the entire list `[func1, func2]` as a single item, resulting in `self.hooks['response'] = [[func1, func2]]` instead of the desired `self.hooks['response'] = [func1, func2]`.\n\nMy earlier suggestion to modify the `register_hook` method to detect and handle lists is exactly what's needed.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: ## Summary: Bug Investigation and Fix Preparation in Requests Library\n\n### Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the requests project, specifically related to the hooks argument in the Request class not properly handling lists of hook functions.\n\n### Complete Investigation Results\n\n1. **Project Structure Exploration**\n   - Explored the main project directory `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/`\n   - Identified the core `requests/` module containing the main codebase\n   - Located key files including `models.py` where the Request class is defined\n\n2. **Request Class Analysis**\n   - Found the Request class in `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py`\n   - Examined the `__init__` method (lines 48-67) which accepts a `hooks` parameter\n   - Analyzed the hooks initialization process (lines 143-152)\n\n3. **Hook System Investigation**\n   - **Hook Constants**: Located in `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/hooks.py` line 29:\n     ```python\n     HOOKS = ('args', 'pre_request', 'pre_send', 'post_request', 'response')\n     ```\n   - **Hook Initialization**: Lines 144-147 create empty lists for each hook event\n   - **Hook Processing**: Lines 149-152 process provided hooks dictionary\n   - **Hook Consumption**: `dispatch_hook` function in `hooks.py` lines 32-49 executes registered hooks\n\n4. **Bug Identification and Root Cause Analysis**\n   - **Primary Bug Location**: `register_hook` method at lines 463-466 in `models.py`\n   - **Current Implementation**: Simply does `self.hooks[event].append(hook)` without checking hook type\n   - **Root Cause**: When hooks dictionary contains lists (e.g., `{'response': [func1, func2]}`), the entire list is appended as a single item, resulting in `self.hooks[event] = [[func1, func2]]` instead of `self.hooks[event] = [func1, func2]`\n   - **Failure Point**: `dispatch_hook` tries to call each hook but fails when encountering a list instead of a callable function\n\n### Technical Details Discovered\n\n**Key Files and Methods:**\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py`\n  - `Request.__init__()` (lines 48-177) - processes hooks parameter\n  - `register_hook()` (lines 463-466) - **BUG LOCATION**\n  - `deregister_hook()` (lines 468-477) - removes hooks\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/hooks.py`\n  - `dispatch_hook()` (lines 32-49) - executes registered hooks\n  - `HOOKS` constant (line 29) - defines valid hook events\n\n**Hook Processing Flow:**\n1. `Request.__init__()` receives hooks dictionary\n2. Iterates through hooks: `for (k, v) in list(hooks.items())`\n3. Calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each pair\n4. `register_hook()` appends hook to `self.hooks[event]` list\n5. Later, `dispatch_hook()` iterates and calls each registered hook\n\n### Bug Analysis Complete\n\n**Problem Statement Confirmed:**\n- The Request class doesn't properly handle lists of hook functions in the hooks dictionary parameter\n- Current code treats entire lists as single hooks, causing runtime failures\n\n**Interconnected Bug Locations:**\n1. **Primary**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py` lines 463-466 (register_hook method)\n2. **Secondary**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py` lines 149-152 (hook processing in __init__)\n\n### Fix Strategy Developed\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\nModify the `register_hook` method to detect and properly handle both single functions and lists of functions:\n\n```python\ndef register_hook(self, event, hook):\n    \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n    # Handle both single hooks and lists of hooks\n    if hasattr(hook, '__iter__') and not hasattr(hook, '__call__'):\n        # It's a list/iterable of hooks\n        for h in hook:\n            self.hooks[event].append(h)\n    else:\n        # It's a single hook function\n        self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n```\n\n**Benefits of This Approach:**\n- Maintains backward compatibility for single functions\n- Properly handles lists of functions\n- Preserves existing code structure and separation of concerns\n- No changes needed to hook processing in `__init__` method\n\n### Current Status: Ready for Implementation\n\n**Code Review Completed:**\n- ✅ Location 1 (lines 463-466): Current `register_hook` method identified and ready for modification\n- ✅ Location 2 (lines 149-152): Hook processing logic confirmed to work correctly with enhanced `register_hook`\n- ✅ Fix strategy validated against hook consumption in `dispatch_hook`\n- ✅ Backward compatibility ensured\n\n**Tools Used:**\n- `explore_directory`: Project structure navigation\n- `read_file_lines`: Code examination\n- `search_code_with_context`: Method and constant location\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe investigation is complete with a clear understanding of the bug, its root cause, and the precise fix needed.

The issue is that the `register_hook` method doesn't properly handle when a list of hook functions is passed in the hooks dictionary during Request initialization.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n1. When `Request.__init__()` processes the hooks parameter, it calls `register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each key-value pair\n2. If `v` is a list of functions (e.g., `[func1, func2]`), the current `register_hook` method simply appends the entire list as a single item: `self.hooks[event].append([func1, func2])`\n3.

The problem statement confirms my analysis - the bug is that the Request class doesn't properly handle lists of hook functions in the hooks dictionary parameter.\n\n**S**\n\nBased on my investigation of the interconnected bug locations, here are my repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Bug location 1 - register_hook method (lines 463-466)]**: Modify the `register_hook` method to properly handle both single functions and lists of functions:\n   ```python\n   def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n       \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n       # Handle both single hooks and lists of hooks\n       if hasattr(hook, '__iter__') and not hasattr(hook, '__call__'):\n           # It's a list/iterable of hooks\n           for h in hook:\n               self.hooks[event].append(h)\n       else:\n           # It's a single hook function\n           self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n   ```\n   This change enables the method to detect when `hook` is a list and register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single functions.\n\n2. **[Bug location 2 - Hook processing in __init__ (lines 149-152)]**: The existing code can remain unchanged since it properly calls `register_hook` for each key-value pair. The fix in location 1 will handle the list processing automatically when called from here. This maintains the clean separation of concerns where `__init__` handles dictionary iteration and `register_hook` handles the actual registration logic.\n\n**How these fixes work together:**\n- Location 2 continues to iterate through the hooks dictionary and call `register_hook` for each event-hook pair\n- Location 1 (the enhanced `register_hook` method) now intelligently handles both single functions and lists of functions\n- This allows users to pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}` and have both functions properly registered\n- The fix maintains backward compatibility for existing code that passes single functions\n- The enhanced `register_hook` method can also be used directly for programmatic hook registration with lists\n\nThis solution directly addresses the problem statement by allowing lists as values in the hooks dictionary while preserving all existing functionality.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py lines 463-466\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n        \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n\n        self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py lines 149-152\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        hooks = hooks or {}\n\n        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n\n\n\n**Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n",

The fix in location 1 will handle the list processing automatically when called from here. This maintains the clean separation of concerns where `__init__` handles dictionary iteration and `register_hook` handles the actual registration logic.\n\n**How these fixes work together:**\n- Location 2 continues to iterate through the hooks dictionary and call `register_hook` for each event-hook pair\n- Location 1 (the enhanced `register_hook` method) now intelligently handles both single functions and lists of functions\n- This allows users to pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}` and have both functions properly registered\n- The fix maintains backward compatibility for existing code that passes single functions\n- The enhanced `register_hook` method can also be used directly for programmatic hook registration with lists\n\nThis solution directly addresses the problem statement by allowing lists as values in the hooks dictionary while preserving all existing functionality.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

The fix in location 1 will handle the list processing automatically when called from here. This maintains the clean separation of concerns where `__init__` handles dictionary iteration and `register_hook` handles the actual registration logic.\n\n**How these fixes work together:**\n- Location 2 continues to iterate through the hooks dictionary and call `register_hook` for each event-hook pair\n- Location 1 (the enhanced `register_hook` method) now intelligently handles both single functions and lists of functions\n- This allows users to pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}` and have both functions properly registered\n- The fix maintains backward compatibility for existing code that passes single functions\n- The enhanced `register_hook` method can also be used directly for programmatic hook registration with lists\n\nThis solution directly addresses the problem statement by allowing lists as values in the hooks dictionary while preserving all existing functionality.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

The fix in location 1 will handle the list processing automatically when called from here. This maintains the clean separation of concerns where `__init__` handles dictionary iteration and `register_hook` handles the actual registration logic.\n\n**How these fixes work together:**\n- Location 2 continues to iterate through the hooks dictionary and call `register_hook` for each event-hook pair\n- Location 1 (the enhanced `register_hook` method) now intelligently handles both single functions and lists of functions\n- This allows users to pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}` and have both functions properly registered\n- The fix maintains backward compatibility for existing code that passes single functions\n- The enhanced `register_hook` method can also be used directly for programmatic hook registration with lists\n\nThis solution directly addresses the problem statement by allowing lists as values in the hooks dictionary while preserving all existing functionality.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

The problem statement confirms my analysis - the bug is that the Request class doesn't properly handle lists of hook functions in the hooks dictionary parameter.\n\n**S**\n\nBased on my investigation of the interconnected bug locations, here are my repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Bug location 1 - register_hook method (lines 463-466)]**: Modify the `register_hook` method to properly handle both single functions and lists of functions:\n   ```python\n   def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n       \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n       # Handle both single hooks and lists of hooks\n       if hasattr(hook, '__iter__') and not hasattr(hook, '__call__'):\n           # It's a list/iterable of hooks\n           for h in hook:\n               self.hooks[event].append(h)\n       else:\n           # It's a single hook function\n           self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n   ```\n   This change enables the method to detect when `hook` is a list and register each function individually, while maintaining backward compatibility for single functions.\n\n2. **[Bug location 2 - Hook processing in __init__ (lines 149-152)]**: The existing code can remain unchanged since it properly calls `register_hook` for each key-value pair. The fix in location 1 will handle the list processing automatically when called from here. This maintains the clean separation of concerns where `__init__` handles dictionary iteration and `register_hook` handles the actual registration logic.\n\n**How these fixes work together:**\n- Location 2 continues to iterate through the hooks dictionary and call `register_hook` for each event-hook pair\n- Location 1 (the enhanced `register_hook` method) now intelligently handles both single functions and lists of functions\n- This allows users to pass `hooks={'response': [func1, func2]}` and have both functions properly registered\n- The fix maintains backward compatibility for existing code that passes single functions\n- The enhanced `register_hook` method can also be used directly for programmatic hook registration with lists\n\nThis solution directly addresses the problem statement by allowing lists as values in the hooks dictionary while preserving all existing functionality.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",
