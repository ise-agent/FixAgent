What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\ntmpdir creation fails when the username contains illegal characters for directory names\n`tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory` and `tmp_path_factory` rely on `getpass.getuser()` for determining the `basetemp` directory. I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n",

I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n",

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a pytest project with source code in `src/_pytest/`\n- **Key Finding**: Located `tmpdir.py` file which handles temporary directory functionality\n\n### 2. Source Code Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` and `read_file_lines` on pytest source files\n- **Target File**: `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py`\n- **Result**: Found the root cause of the bug\n\n### 3. Bug Location Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"getpass\" and \"get_user\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `get_user()` function at lines 151-159 uses `getpass.getuser()`\n  - Function is called at line 114 in the `getbasetemp()` method\n  - Username is used directly in directory path creation at line 117: `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"`\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- **Root Cause Identified**: The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` at line 117\n- **Problem Understanding**: `getpass.getuser()` returns usernames with illegal directory characters (backslashes in domain usernames)\n- **Failure Point**: `rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` at line 118 fails when the path contains illegal characters\n\n### 🔄 Next Steps Required\n- Implement a fix to sanitize the username before using it in directory paths\n- Test the fix to ensure it works with various username formats\n- Verify the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Bug Location\n```python\n# File: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\n# Lines 114-118\nuser = get_user() or \"unknown\"\n# use a sub-directory in the temproot to speed-up\n# make_numbered_dir() call\nrootdir = temproot.joinpath(f\"pytest-of-{user}\")  # BUG: user can contain backslashes\nrootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)  # FAILS here with illegal characters\n```\n\n### Root Cause\n- `getpass.getuser()` can return domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe`\n- Backslashes are illegal characters in directory names on many filesystems\n- Direct usage of unsanitized username in path creation causes `mkdir()` to fail\n\n### Proposed Solution Strategy\nThe fix should sanitize the username by replacing or removing illegal characters before using it in the directory path. Common approaches:\n1. Replace illegal characters with safe alternatives (e.g., backslashes with underscores)\n2. Use only the username portion after the last backslash for domain accounts\n3. Apply a general sanitization function that handles various illegal characters\n\n### Files to Modify\n- **Primary**: `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` - Modify the `get_user()` function or its usage\n- **Testing**: Verify changes don't break existing tests in the `testing/` directory\n\nThis investigation has successfully identified the exact location and cause of the tmpdir creation bug, providing a clear path forward for implementing the fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nStart line: 151\nEnd line: 159\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nStart line: 114\nEnd line: 118\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug! The issue is in line 117 where the code creates a directory path using `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` where `user` can contain illegal characters like backslashes from domain usernames (e.g., `contoso\\john_doe`).

When this unsanitized username is used in directory path construction, it causes `mkdir()` to fail.\n\n**Repair Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Location 1 (Lines 151-159 - `get_user()` function)**: Modify the `get_user()` function to sanitize the returned username by replacing illegal directory characters with safe alternatives. This is the most appropriate location for the fix as it centralizes the sanitization logic and ensures all callers get a clean username.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a pytest project with source code in `src/_pytest/`\n- **Key Finding**: Located `tmpdir.py` file which handles temporary directory functionality\n\n### 2. Source Code Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` and `read_file_lines` on pytest source files\n- **Target File**: `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py`\n- **Result**: Found the root cause of the bug\n\n### 3. Bug Location Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"getpass\" and \"get_user\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `get_user()` function at lines 151-159 uses `getpass.getuser()`\n  - Function is called at line 114 in the `getbasetemp()` method\n  - Username is used directly in directory path creation at line 117: `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"`\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- **Root Cause Identified**: The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` at line 117\n- **Problem Understanding**: `getpass.getuser()` returns usernames with illegal directory characters (backslashes in domain usernames)\n- **Failure Point**: `rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` at line 118 fails when the path contains illegal characters\n\n### 🔄 Next Steps Required\n- Implement a fix to sanitize the username before using it in directory paths\n- Test the fix to ensure it works with various username formats\n- Verify the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Bug Location\n```python\n# File: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\n# Lines 114-118\nuser = get_user() or \"unknown\"\n# use a sub-directory in the temproot to speed-up\n# make_numbered_dir() call\nrootdir = temproot.joinpath(f\"pytest-of-{user}\")  # BUG: user can contain backslashes\nrootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)  # FAILS here with illegal characters\n```\n\n### Root Cause\n- `getpass.getuser()` can return domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe`\n- Backslashes are illegal characters in directory names on many filesystems\n- Direct usage of unsanitized username in path creation causes `mkdir()` to fail\n\n### Proposed Solution Strategy\nThe fix should sanitize the username by replacing or removing illegal characters before using it in the directory path. Common approaches:\n1. Replace illegal characters with safe alternatives (e.g., backslashes with underscores)\n2. Use only the username portion after the last backslash for domain accounts\n3. Apply a general sanitization function that handles various illegal characters\n\n### Files to Modify\n- **Primary**: `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` - Modify the `get_user()` function or its usage\n- **Testing**: Verify changes don't break existing tests in the `testing/` directory\n\nThis investigation has successfully identified the exact location and cause of the tmpdir creation bug, providing a clear path forward for implementing the fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nStart line: 151\nEnd line: 159\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nStart line: 114\nEnd line: 118\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where `tmpdir` creation fails when usernames contain illegal characters (specifically backslashes in domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe`), I can now provide coordinated repair suggestions for the identified locations.\n\nThe root cause is that `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames with backslashes, which are illegal characters for directory names. When this unsanitized username is used in directory path construction, it causes `mkdir()` to fail.\n\n**Repair Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Location 1 (Lines 151-159 - `get_user()` function)**: Modify the `get_user()` function to sanitize the returned username by replacing illegal directory characters with safe alternatives. This is the most appropriate location for the fix as it centralizes the sanitization logic and ensures all callers get a clean username. The function should replace backslashes and other illegal characters (like `<>:\"|?*`) with underscores or hyphens, or extract just the username portion after the last backslash for domain accounts.\n\n2. **Location 2 (Lines 114-118 - `getbasetemp()` method)**: This location depends on Location 1's fix. If the `get_user()` function is properly sanitized, this code will work correctly without modification. However, as a defensive measure, this location could also apply additional sanitization when constructing the directory path `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` to ensure robustness against any edge cases that might slip through.\n\n**Coordination between locations:**\n- The primary fix should be in Location 1 (`get_user()` function) to sanitize usernames at the source\n- Location 2 will automatically benefit from this fix since it calls `get_user()`\n- This approach ensures that all other potential callers of `get_user()` throughout the codebase also receive sanitized usernames\n- The fix maintains backward compatibility while preventing directory creation failures\n\n**Recommended implementation approach:**\n- Replace backslashes with underscores or extract the username portion after the last backslash\n- Handle other potentially illegal characters for cross-platform compatibility\n- Preserve the original username semantics while ensuring directory-safe naming\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug! The issue is in line 117 where the code creates a directory path using `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` where `user` can contain illegal characters like backslashes from domain usernames (e.g., `contoso\\john_doe`). Let me examine the complete context around this code to understand the full picture.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\", \"start_line\": 105, \"end_line\": 125 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nTotal lines: 231\nShowing lines 105-125:\n\n 105:             return self._basetemp\n 106: \n 107:         if self._given_basetemp is not None:\n 108:             basetemp = self._given_basetemp\n 109:             ensure_reset_dir(basetemp)\n 110:             basetemp = basetemp.resolve()\n 111:         else:\n 112:             from_env = os.environ.get(\"PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT\")\n 113:             temproot = Path(from_env or tempfile.gettempdir()).resolve()\n 114:             user = get_user() or \"unknown\"\n 115:             # use a sub-directory in the temproot to speed-up\n 116:             # make_numbered_dir() call\n 117:             rootdir = temproot.joinpath(f\"pytest-of-{user}\")\n 118:             rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n 119:             basetemp = make_numbered_dir_with_cleanup(\n 120:                 prefix=\"pytest-\", root=rootdir, keep=3, lock_timeout=LOCK_TIMEOUT\n 121:             )\n 122:         assert basetemp is not None, basetemp\n 123:         self._basetemp = t = basetemp\n 124:         self._trace(\"new basetemp\", t)\n 125:         return t\n\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug! The issue is that `getpass.getuser()` can return usernames with illegal characters like backslashes (e.g., `contoso\\john_doe`), and when this username is used directly in the directory path `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"`, it creates invalid directory paths that cause `mkdir()` to fail.\n\nLet me examine the `get_user()` function more closely to see the complete implementation:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\", \"start_line\": 151, \"end_line\": 165 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nTotal lines: 231\nShowing lines 151-165:\n\n 151: def get_user() -> Optional[str]:\n 152:     \"\"\"Return the current user name, or None if getuser() does not work\n 153:     in the current environment (see #1010).\"\"\"\n 154:     import getpass\n 155: \n 156:     try:\n 157:         return getpass.getuser()\n 158:     except (ImportError, KeyError):\n 159:         return None\n 160: \n 161: \n 162: def pytest_configure(config: Config) -> None:\n 163:     \"\"\"Create a TempdirFactory and attach it to the config object.\n 164: \n 165:     This is to comply with existing plugins which expect the handler to be\n\nPerfect! Now I have all the context I need. The bug is clear:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe` which contain backslashes\n2. **Failure Point**: Line 117 creates `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` which becomes `pytest-of-contoso\\john_doe`\n3. **Error**: Line 118 `rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` fails because backslashes are illegal in directory names\n\nThe fix needs to sanitize the username before using it in the directory path. Let me check if there are any existing utilities for path sanitization in the codebase:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"sanitize\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'sanitize' in directory '/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest'\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and its context:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Root Cause**: `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe` containing backslashes\n2. **Failure Location**: Line 117 in `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` where `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` creates invalid paths\n3. **Error Point**: Line 118 where `rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` fails due to illegal characters in the path\n\n**Key Locations Identified:**\n1. **Line 117**: Where the problematic path is constructed using unsanitized username\n2. **Lines 151-159**: The `get_user()` function that returns the problematic username\n3. **Line 118**: Where the actual failure occurs during directory creation\n\n**Solution Strategy:**\nThe fix should sanitize the username by replacing illegal characters (like backslashes) with safe alternatives before using it in directory paths. The most logical place to implement this is either:\n- In the `get_user()` function itself (lines 151-159)\n- At the point of usage (line 117)\n\nSince the problem description specifically mentions this affects `tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory` and `tmp_path_factory`, and the issue is fundamentally about using usernames in directory paths, the fix should sanitize the username for directory usage.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nI have identified the precise locations where the bug occurs and can be fixed:\n\n1. **Lines 151-159**: The `get_user()` function that needs to sanitize the returned username\n2. **Line 117**: The specific line where the unsanitized username is used in path construction\n3. **Line 118**: Where the failure actually occurs during directory creation\n\nThe fix involves sanitizing the username by replacing illegal directory characters (like backslashes) with safe alternatives before using it in the directory path.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where `tmpdir` creation fails when usernames contain illegal characters (specifically backslashes in domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe`), I have identified the precise locations where this issue occurs and can be fixed.\n\nThe root cause is that `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames with backslashes, which are illegal characters for directory names.

Apply a general sanitization function that handles various illegal characters\n\n### Files to Modify\n- **Primary**: `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` - Modify the `get_user()` function or its usage\n- **Testing**: Verify changes don't break existing tests in the `testing/` directory\n\nThis investigation has successfully identified the exact location and cause of the tmpdir creation bug, providing a clear path forward for implementing the fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nStart line: 151\nEnd line: 159\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nStart line: 114\nEnd line: 118\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where `tmpdir` creation fails when usernames contain illegal characters (specifically backslashes in domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe`), I can now provide coordinated repair suggestions for the identified locations.\n\nThe root cause is that `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames with backslashes, which are illegal characters for directory names. When this unsanitized username is used in directory path construction, it causes `mkdir()` to fail.\n\n**Repair Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Location 1 (Lines 151-159 - `get_user()` function)**: Modify the `get_user()` function to sanitize the returned username by replacing illegal directory characters with safe alternatives. This is the most appropriate location for the fix as it centralizes the sanitization logic and ensures all callers get a clean username. The function should replace backslashes and other illegal characters (like `<>:\"|?*`) with underscores or hyphens, or extract just the username portion after the last backslash for domain accounts.\n\n2. **Location 2 (Lines 114-118 - `getbasetemp()` method)**: This location depends on Location 1's fix. If the `get_user()` function is properly sanitized, this code will work correctly without modification. However, as a defensive measure, this location could also apply additional sanitization when constructing the directory path `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` to ensure robustness against any edge cases that might slip through.\n\n**Coordination between locations:**\n- The primary fix should be in Location 1 (`get_user()` function) to sanitize usernames at the source\n- Location 2 will automatically benefit from this fix since it calls `get_user()`\n- This approach ensures that all other potential callers of `get_user()` throughout the codebase also receive sanitized usernames\n- The fix maintains backward compatibility while preventing directory creation failures\n\n**Recommended implementation approach:**\n- Replace backslashes with underscores or extract the username portion after the last backslash\n- Handle other potentially illegal characters for cross-platform compatibility\n- Preserve the original username semantics while ensuring directory-safe naming\nNote that the Patch provided should be a direct substitution of the location code by the Locator.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug! The issue is in line 117 where the code creates a directory path using `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` where `user` can contain illegal characters like backslashes from domain usernames (e.g., `contoso\\john_doe`). Let me examine the complete context around this code to understand the full picture.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\", \"start_line\": 105, \"end_line\": 125 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nTotal lines: 231\nShowing lines 105-125:\n\n 105:             return self._basetemp\n 106: \n 107:         if self._given_basetemp is not None:\n 108:             basetemp = self._given_basetemp\n 109:             ensure_reset_dir(basetemp)\n 110:             basetemp = basetemp.resolve()\n 111:         else:\n 112:             from_env = os.environ.get(\"PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT\")\n 113:             temproot = Path(from_env or tempfile.gettempdir()).resolve()\n 114:             user = get_user() or \"unknown\"\n 115:             # use a sub-directory in the temproot to speed-up\n 116:             # make_numbered_dir() call\n 117:             rootdir = temproot.joinpath(f\"pytest-of-{user}\")\n 118:             rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n 119:             basetemp = make_numbered_dir_with_cleanup(\n 120:                 prefix=\"pytest-\", root=rootdir, keep=3, lock_timeout=LOCK_TIMEOUT\n 121:             )\n 122:         assert basetemp is not None, basetemp\n 123:         self._basetemp = t = basetemp\n 124:         self._trace(\"new basetemp\", t)\n 125:         return t\n\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug! The issue is that `getpass.getuser()` can return usernames with illegal characters like backslashes (e.g., `contoso\\john_doe`), and when this username is used directly in the directory path `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"`, it creates invalid directory paths that cause `mkdir()` to fail.\n\nLet me examine the `get_user()` function more closely to see the complete implementation:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\", \"start_line\": 151, \"end_line\": 165 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nTotal lines: 231\nShowing lines 151-165:\n\n 151: def get_user() -> Optional[str]:\n 152:     \"\"\"Return the current user name, or None if getuser() does not work\n 153:     in the current environment (see #1010).\"\"\"\n 154:     import getpass\n 155: \n 156:     try:\n 157:         return getpass.getuser()\n 158:     except (ImportError, KeyError):\n 159:         return None\n 160: \n 161: \n 162: def pytest_configure(config: Config) -> None:\n 163:     \"\"\"Create a TempdirFactory and attach it to the config object.\n 164: \n 165:     This is to comply with existing plugins which expect the handler to be\n\nPerfect! Now I have all the context I need. The bug is clear:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe` which contain backslashes\n2. **Failure Point**: Line 117 creates `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` which becomes `pytest-of-contoso\\john_doe`\n3. **Error**: Line 118 `rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` fails because backslashes are illegal in directory names\n\nThe fix needs to sanitize the username before using it in the directory path. Let me check if there are any existing utilities for path sanitization in the codebase:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"sanitize\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'sanitize' in directory '/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest'\n#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and its context:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Root Cause**: `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe` containing backslashes\n2. **Failure Location**: Line 117 in `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` where `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` creates invalid paths\n3. **Error Point**: Line 118 where `rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` fails due to illegal characters in the path\n\n**Key Locations Identified:**\n1. **Line 117**: Where the problematic path is constructed using unsanitized username\n2. **Lines 151-159**: The `get_user()` function that returns the problematic username\n3. **Line 118**: Where the actual failure occurs during directory creation\n\n**Solution Strategy:**\nThe fix should sanitize the username by replacing illegal characters (like backslashes) with safe alternatives before using it in directory paths.

characters in the path\n3. **Clear fix strategy**: Sanitize the username by replacing illegal characters with safe alternatives\n4. **Minimal impact**: The fix can be implemented without breaking existing functionality\n5. **Centralized solution**: Fixing `get_user()` will solve the problem for all callers throughout the codebase\n\nThe locations are well-defined, the problem is clearly understood, and the fix strategy is straightforward - sanitize the username to make it safe for directory names.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py

I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py lines 151-159\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndef get_user() -> Optional[str]:\n    \"\"\"Return the current user name, or None if getuser() does not work\n    in the current environment (see #1010).\"\"\"\n    import getpass\n\n    try:\n        return getpass.getuser()\n    except (ImportError, KeyError):\n        return None\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py lines 114-118\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            user = get_user() or \"unknown\"\n            # use a sub-directory in the temproot to speed-up\n            # make_numbered_dir() call\n            rootdir = temproot.joinpath(f\"pytest-of-{user}\")\n            rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n\n\n\n**Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list.

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Bug Investigation and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nFind and repair a bug in the pytest project where `tmpdir` creation fails when usernames contain illegal characters for directory names (specifically backslashes in domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe`).\n\n## Key Actions Taken and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a pytest project with source code in `src/_pytest/`\n- **Key Finding**: Located `tmpdir.py` file which handles temporary directory functionality\n\n### 2. Source Code Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` and `read_file_lines` on pytest source files\n- **Target File**: `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py`\n- **Result**: Found the root cause of the bug\n\n### 3. Bug Location Identification\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"getpass\" and \"get_user\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `get_user()` function at lines 151-159 uses `getpass.getuser()`\n  - Function is called at line 114 in the `getbasetemp()` method\n  - Username is used directly in directory path creation at line 117: `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"`\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- **Root Cause Identified**: The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` at line 117\n- **Problem Understanding**: `getpass.getuser()` returns usernames with illegal directory characters (backslashes in domain usernames)\n- **Failure Point**: `rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` at line 118 fails when the path contains illegal characters\n\n### 🔄 Next Steps Required\n- Implement a fix to sanitize the username before using it in directory paths\n- Test the fix to ensure it works with various username formats\n- Verify the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Bug Location\n```python\n# File: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\n# Lines 114-118\nuser = get_user() or \"unknown\"\n# use a sub-directory in the temproot to speed-up\n# make_numbered_dir() call\nrootdir = temproot.joinpath(f\"pytest-of-{user}\")  # BUG: user can contain backslashes\nrootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)  # FAILS here with illegal characters\n```\n\n### Root Cause\n- `getpass.getuser()` can return domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe`\n- Backslashes are illegal characters in directory names on many filesystems\n- Direct usage of unsanitized username in path creation causes `mkdir()` to fail\n\n### Proposed Solution Strategy\nThe fix should sanitize the username by replacing or removing illegal characters before using it in the directory path. Common approaches:\n1. Replace illegal characters with safe alternatives (e.g., backslashes with underscores)\n2. Use only the username portion after the last backslash for domain accounts\n3. Apply a general sanitization function that handles various illegal characters\n\n### Files to Modify\n- **Primary**: `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` - Modify the `get_user()` function or its usage\n- **Testing**: Verify changes don't break existing tests in the `testing/` directory\n\nThis investigation has successfully identified the exact location and cause of the tmpdir creation bug, providing a clear path forward for implementing the fix.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: Now I have a clear understanding of the bug! The issue is in line 117 where the code creates a directory path using `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` where `user` can contain illegal characters like backslashes from domain usernames (e.g., `contoso\\john_doe`). Let me examine the complete context around this code to understand the full picture.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\", \"start_line\": 105, \"end_line\": 125 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nTotal lines: 231\nShowing lines 105-125:\n\n 105:             return self._basetemp\n 106: \n 107:         if self._given_basetemp is not None:\n 108:             basetemp = self._given_basetemp\n 109:             ensure_reset_dir(basetemp)\n 110:             basetemp = basetemp.resolve()\n 111:         else:\n 112:             from_env = os.environ.get(\"PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT\")\n 113:             temproot = Path(from_env or tempfile.gettempdir()).resolve()\n 114:             user = get_user() or \"unknown\"\n 115:             # use a sub-directory in the temproot to speed-up\n 116:             # make_numbered_dir() call\n 117:             rootdir = temproot.joinpath(f\"pytest-of-{user}\")\n 118:             rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n 119:             basetemp = make_numbered_dir_with_cleanup(\n 120:                 prefix=\"pytest-\", root=rootdir, keep=3, lock_timeout=LOCK_TIMEOUT\n 121:             )\n 122:         assert basetemp is not None, basetemp\n 123:         self._basetemp = t = basetemp\n 124:         self._trace(\"new basetemp\", t)\n 125:         return t\n\n\nAssistant: Now I have a complete understanding of the bug! The issue is that `getpass.getuser()` can return usernames with illegal characters like backslashes (e.g., `contoso\\john_doe`), and when this username is used directly in the directory path `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"`, it creates invalid directory paths that cause `mkdir()` to fail.\n\nLet me examine the `get_user()` function more closely to see the complete implementation:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\", \"start_line\": 151, \"end_line\": 165 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\nTotal lines: 231\nShowing lines 151-165:\n\n 151: def get_user() -> Optional[str]:\n 152:     \"\"\"Return the current user name, or None if getuser() does not work\n 153:     in the current environment (see #1010).\"\"\"\n 154:     import getpass\n 155: \n 156:     try:\n 157:         return getpass.getuser()\n 158:     except (ImportError, KeyError):\n 159:         return None\n 160: \n 161: \n 162: def pytest_configure(config: Config) -> None:\n 163:     \"\"\"Create a TempdirFactory and attach it to the config object.\n 164: \n 165:     This is to comply with existing plugins which expect the handler to be\n\n\nAssistant: Perfect! Now I have all the context I need. The bug is clear:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe` which contain backslashes\n2. **Failure Point**: Line 117 creates `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` which becomes `pytest-of-contoso\\john_doe`\n3. **Error**: Line 118 `rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` fails because backslashes are illegal in directory names\n\nThe fix needs to sanitize the username before using it in the directory path. Let me check if there are any existing utilities for path sanitization in the codebase:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"sanitize\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'sanitize' in directory '/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest'\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and its context:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Root Cause**: `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe` containing backslashes\n2. **Failure Location**: Line 117 in `/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` where `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` creates invalid paths\n3. **Error Point**: Line 118 where `rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)` fails due to illegal characters in the path\n\n**Key Locations Identified:**\n1. **Line 117**: Where the problematic path is constructed using unsanitized username\n2. **Lines 151-159**: The `get_user()` function that returns the problematic username\n3. **Line 118**: Where the actual failure occurs during directory creation\n\n**Solution Strategy:**\nThe fix should sanitize the username by replacing illegal characters (like backslashes) with safe alternatives before using it in directory paths. The most logical place to implement this is either:\n- In the `get_user()` function itself (lines 151-159)\n- At the point of usage (line 117)\n\nSince the problem description specifically mentions this affects `tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory` and `tmp_path_factory`, and the issue is fundamentally about using usernames in directory paths, the fix should sanitize the username for directory usage.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nI have identified the precise locations where the bug occurs and can be fixed:\n\n1. **Lines 151-159**: The `get_user()` function that needs to sanitize the returned username\n2. **Line 117**: The specific line where the unsanitized username is used in path construction\n3. **Line 118**: Where the failure actually occurs during directory creation\n\nThe fix involves sanitizing the username by replacing illegal directory characters (like backslashes) with safe alternatives before using it in the directory path.\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where `tmpdir` creation fails when usernames contain illegal characters (specifically backslashes in domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe`), I have identified the precise locations where this issue occurs and can be fixed.\n\nThe root cause is that `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames with backslashes, which are illegal characters for directory names. When this unsanitized username is used in directory path construction, it causes `mkdir()` to fail.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 151,\n            \"end_line\": 159\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 114,\n            \"end_line\": 118\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug manifests in two key locations:\n\n1. **Lines 151-159**: The `get_user()` function that returns the problematic username containing illegal characters\n2. **Lines 114-118**: The `getbasetemp()` method where the unsanitized username is used to construct the directory path `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` and where the actual failure occurs during `mkdir()`\n\nThe fix should sanitize the username by replacing illegal directory characters (like backslashes) with safe alternatives before using it in directory paths.\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where `tmpdir` creation fails when usernames contain illegal characters (specifically backslashes in domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe`), I have identified the precise locations where this issue occurs and can be fixed.\n\nThe root cause is that `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames with backslashes, which are illegal characters for directory names. When this unsanitized username is used in directory path construction, it causes `mkdir()` to fail.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 151,\n            \"end_line\": 159\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 114,\n            \"end_line\": 118\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe bug manifests in two key locations:\n\n1. **Lines 151-159**: The `get_user()` function that returns the problematic username containing illegal characters\n2. **Lines 114-118**: The `getbasetemp()` method where the unsanitized username is used to construct the directory path `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` and where the actual failure occurs during `mkdir()`\n\nThe fix should sanitize the username by replacing illegal directory characters (like backslashes) with safe alternatives before using it in directory paths.\nAssistant: PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where `tmpdir` creation fails when usernames contain illegal characters (specifically backslashes in domain usernames like `contoso\\john_doe`), I can now provide coordinated repair suggestions for the identified locations.\n\nThe root cause is that `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames with backslashes, which are illegal characters for directory names. When this unsanitized username is used in directory path construction, it causes `mkdir()` to fail.\n\n**Repair Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Location 1 (Lines 151-159 - `get_user()` function)**: Modify the `get_user()` function to sanitize the returned username by replacing illegal directory characters with safe alternatives. This is the most appropriate location for the fix as it centralizes the sanitization logic and ensures all callers get a clean username. The function should replace backslashes and other illegal characters (like `<>:\"|?*`) with underscores or hyphens, or extract just the username portion after the last backslash for domain accounts.\n\n2. **Location 2 (Lines 114-118 - `getbasetemp()` method)**: This location depends on Location 1's fix. If the `get_user()` function is properly sanitized, this code will work correctly without modification. However, as a defensive measure, this location could also apply additional sanitization when constructing the directory path `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` to ensure robustness against any edge cases that might slip through.\n\n**Coordination between locations:**\n- The primary fix should be in Location 1 (`get_user()` function) to sanitize usernames at the source\n- Location 2 will automatically benefit from this fix since it calls `get_user()`\n- This approach ensures that all other potential callers of `get_user()` throughout the codebase also receive sanitized usernames\n- The fix maintains backward compatibility while preventing directory creation failures\n\n**Recommended implementation approach:**\n- Replace backslashes with underscores or extract the username portion after the last backslash\n- Handle other potentially illegal characters for cross-platform compatibility\n- Preserve the original username semantics while ensuring directory-safe naming\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py lines 151-159\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndef get_user() -> Optional[str]:\n    \"\"\"Return the current user name, or None if getuser() does not work\n    in the current environment (see #1010).\"\"\"\n    import getpass\n\n    try:\n        return getpass.getuser()\n    except (ImportError, KeyError):\n        return None\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/pytest/src/_pytest/tmpdir.py lines 114-118\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            user = get_user() or \"unknown\"\n            # use a sub-directory in the temproot to speed-up\n            # make_numbered_dir() call\n            rootdir = temproot.joinpath(f\"pytest-of-{user}\")\n            rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\nAssistant: Looking at the provided code segments and the problem statement, I can see that these locations are indeed the correct places to implement the fix for the tmpdir creation bug.\n\n**Analysis of the locations:**\n\n**Location 1 (Lines 151-159)**: The `get_user()` function is the source of the problematic username containing illegal characters like backslashes. This is the ideal place to implement sanitization logic to ensure that any username returned is safe for use in directory paths.\n\n**Location 2 (Lines 114-118)**: This is where the unsanitized username is directly used in the path construction `f\"pytest-of-{user}\"` and where the actual failure occurs during `rootdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)`. The error message in the problem statement shows exactly this failure point.\n\n**Why these locations are ready for fixing:**\n\n1. **Root cause identified**: The issue is clearly that `getpass.getuser()` returns domain usernames with backslashes (e.g., `contoso\\john_doe`)\n2. **Failure point confirmed**: The error occurs at `mkdir()` when trying to create a directory with illegal characters in the path\n3. **Clear fix strategy**: Sanitize the username by replacing illegal characters with safe alternatives\n4. **Minimal impact**: The fix can be implemented without breaking existing functionality\n5. **Centralized solution**: Fixing `get_user()` will solve the problem for all callers throughout the codebase\n\nThe locations are well-defined, the problem is clearly understood, and the fix strategy is straightforward - sanitize the username to make it safe for directory names.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\nUser: [Location 1]
