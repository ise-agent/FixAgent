In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n",

What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the ​File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n",

    "response": "# Django File Upload Permissions Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the Django project related to file upload permissions. The issue involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded, depending on whether they are stored in memory or as temporary files.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a Django framework codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories\n\n### 2. File Upload Permission Settings Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in `django/conf/global_settings.py` (line 307)\n  - Located permission handling in `django/core/files/storage.py` with `file_permissions_mode` property\n  - Discovered extensive test coverage in `tests/file_storage/tests.py` including permission tests\n\n### 3. Upload File Classes Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MemoryUploadedFile\" and \"TemporaryUploadedFile\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found two main upload file classes: `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`\n  - Located in `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py`\n  - Upload handlers in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` create these different file types\n\n### 4. Detailed Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on critical files\n- **Key Technical Details**:\n  - `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for disk storage (line 61 in uploadedfile.py)\n  - `InMemoryUploadedFile` stores files in memory using StringIO/BytesIO\n  - Custom Windows implementation in `django/core/files/temp.py` uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` (line 38)\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Issues Identified\n1. **Permission Inconsistency**: The bug appears to be that `TemporaryUploadedFile` (disk-based) and `InMemoryUploadedFile` (memory-based) handle permissions differently\n2. **Root Cause**: When files are saved from `TemporaryUploadedFile`, the temporary file permissions may not respect the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting, while `InMemoryUploadedFile` would get proper permissions when saved to storage\n\n### Technical Analysis Complete\n- Located all relevant code components\n- Identified the permission flow from settings → storage → upload handlers\n- Found test cases that demonstrate expected behavior\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Examine Storage Save Method**: Need to investigate how `FileSystemStorage.save()` handles permissions differently for the two upload file types\n2. **Create Reproduction Test**: Write a test that demonstrates the permission inconsistency\n3. **Implement Fix**: Likely need to ensure temporary files respect `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting when created or when moved to final location\n4. **Verify Fix**: Run existing permission tests and new reproduction test\n\n## Important Technical Context\n\n- **Settings**: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` controls final file permissions (default: None)\n- **Upload Threshold**: Django switches between memory and disk storage based on file size\n- **Platform Differences**: Windows has custom temporary file implementation\n- **Storage Integration**: Final permissions are applied in the storage layer, not during upload\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the core components and likely root cause of the permission inconsistency bug. The next phase should focus on reproducing the issue and implementing a fix in the storage or upload file handling logic.",

Detailed Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on critical files\n- **Key Technical Details**:\n  - `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for disk storage (line 61 in uploadedfile.py)\n  - `InMemoryUploadedFile` stores files in memory using StringIO/BytesIO\n  - Custom Windows implementation in `django/core/files/temp.py` uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` (line 38)\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Issues Identified\n1. **Permission Inconsistency**: The bug appears to be that `TemporaryUploadedFile` (disk-based) and `InMemoryUploadedFile` (memory-based) handle permissions differently\n2. **Root Cause**: When files are saved from `TemporaryUploadedFile`, the temporary file permissions may not respect the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting, while `InMemoryUploadedFile` would get proper permissions when saved to storage\n\n### Technical Analysis Complete\n- Located all relevant code components\n- Identified the permission flow from settings → storage → upload handlers\n- Found test cases that demonstrate expected behavior\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Examine Storage Save Method**: Need to investigate how `FileSystemStorage.save()` handles permissions differently for the two upload file types\n2. **Create Reproduction Test**: Write a test that demonstrates the permission inconsistency\n3. **Implement Fix**: Likely need to ensure temporary files respect `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting when created or when moved to final location\n4. **Verify Fix**: Run existing permission tests and new reproduction test\n\n## Important Technical Context\n\n- **Settings**: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` controls final file permissions (default: None)\n- **Upload Threshold**: Django switches between memory and disk storage based on file size\n- **Platform Differences**: Windows has custom temporary file implementation\n- **Storage Integration**: Final permissions are applied in the storage layer, not during upload\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the core components and likely root cause of the permission inconsistency bug. The next phase should focus on reproducing the issue and implementing a fix in the storage or upload file handling logic.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine the temp.py file to understand how NamedTemporaryFile is used and where the permission issue occurs.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/temp.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/temp.py\nTotal lines: 74\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: \"\"\"\n   2: The temp module provides a NamedTemporaryFile that can be reopened in the same\n   3: process on any platform.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n",

The issue involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded, depending on whether they are stored in memory or as temporary files.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a Django framework codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories\n\n### 2. File Upload Permission Settings Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in `django/conf/global_settings.py` (line 307)\n  - Located permission handling in `django/core/files/storage.py` with `file_permissions_mode` property\n  - Discovered extensive test coverage in `tests/file_storage/tests.py` including permission tests\n\n### 3. Upload File Classes Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MemoryUploadedFile\" and \"TemporaryUploadedFile\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found two main upload file classes: `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`\n  - Located in `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py`\n  - Upload handlers in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` create these different file types\n\n### 4.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django File Upload Permissions Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the Django project related to file upload permissions. The issue involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded, depending on whether they are stored in memory or as temporary files.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a Django framework codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories\n\n### 2. File Upload Permission Settings Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in `django/conf/global_settings.py` (line 307)\n  - Located permission handling in `django/core/files/storage.py` with `file_permissions_mode` property\n  - Discovered extensive test coverage in `tests/file_storage/tests.py` including permission tests\n\n### 3. Upload File Classes Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MemoryUploadedFile\" and \"TemporaryUploadedFile\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found two main upload file classes: `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`\n  - Located in `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py`\n  - Upload handlers in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` create these different file types\n\n### 4. Detailed Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on critical files\n- **Key Technical Details**:\n  - `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for disk storage (line 61 in uploadedfile.py)\n  - `InMemoryUploadedFile` stores files in memory using StringIO/BytesIO\n  - Custom Windows implementation in `django/core/files/temp.py` uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` (line 38)\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Issues Identified\n1. **Permission Inconsistency**: The bug appears to be that `TemporaryUploadedFile` (disk-based) and `InMemoryUploadedFile` (memory-based) handle permissions differently\n2. **Root Cause**: When files are saved from `TemporaryUploadedFile`, the temporary file permissions may not respect the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting, while `InMemoryUploadedFile` would get proper permissions when saved to storage\n\n### Technical Analysis Complete\n- Located all relevant code components\n- Identified the permission flow from settings → storage → upload handlers\n- Found test cases that demonstrate expected behavior\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Examine Storage Save Method**: Need to investigate how `FileSystemStorage.save()` handles permissions differently for the two upload file types\n2. **Create Reproduction Test**: Write a test that demonstrates the permission inconsistency\n3. **Implement Fix**: Likely need to ensure temporary files respect `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting when created or when moved to final location\n4. **Verify Fix**: Run existing permission tests and new reproduction test\n\n## Important Technical Context\n\n- **Settings**: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` controls final file permissions (default: None)\n- **Upload Threshold**: Django switches between memory and disk storage based on file size\n- **Platform Differences**: Windows has custom temporary file implementation\n- **Storage Integration**: Final permissions are applied in the storage layer, not during upload\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the core components and likely root cause of the permission inconsistency bug. The next phase should focus on reproducing the issue and implementing a fix in the storage or upload file handling logic.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine the temp.py file to understand how NamedTemporaryFile is used and where the permission issue occurs.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/temp.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/temp.py\nTotal lines: 74\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: \"\"\"\n   2: The temp module provides a NamedTemporaryFile that can be reopened in the same\n   3: process on any platform.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django File Upload Permissions Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the Django project related to file upload permissions. The issue involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded, depending on whether they are stored in memory or as temporary files.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a Django framework codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories\n\n### 2. File Upload Permission Settings Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in `django/conf/global_settings.py` (line 307)\n  - Located permission handling in `django/core/files/storage.py` with `file_permissions_mode` property\n  - Discovered extensive test coverage in `tests/file_storage/tests.py` including permission tests\n\n### 3. Upload File Classes Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MemoryUploadedFile\" and \"TemporaryUploadedFile\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found two main upload file classes: `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`\n  - Located in `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py`\n  - Upload handlers in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` create these different file types\n\n### 4. Detailed Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on critical files\n- **Key Technical Details**:\n  - `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for disk storage (line 61 in uploadedfile.py)\n  - `InMemoryUploadedFile` stores files in memory using StringIO/BytesIO\n  - Custom Windows implementation in `django/core/files/temp.py` uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` (line 38)\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Issues Identified\n1. **Permission Inconsistency**: The bug appears to be that `TemporaryUploadedFile` (disk-based) and `InMemoryUploadedFile` (memory-based) handle permissions differently\n2. **Root Cause**: When files are saved from `TemporaryUploadedFile`, the temporary file permissions may not respect the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting, while `InMemoryUploadedFile` would get proper permissions when saved to storage\n\n### Technical Analysis Complete\n- Located all relevant code components\n- Identified the permission flow from settings → storage → upload handlers\n- Found test cases that demonstrate expected behavior\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Examine Storage Save Method**: Need to investigate how `FileSystemStorage.save()` handles permissions differently for the two upload file types\n2. **Create Reproduction Test**: Write a test that demonstrates the permission inconsistency\n3. **Implement Fix**: Likely need to ensure temporary files respect `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting when created or when moved to final location\n4. **Verify Fix**: Run existing permission tests and new reproduction test\n\n## Important Technical Context\n\n- **Settings**: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` controls final file permissions (default: None)\n- **Upload Threshold**: Django switches between memory and disk storage based on file size\n- **Platform Differences**: Windows has custom temporary file implementation\n- **Storage Integration**: Final permissions are applied in the storage layer, not during upload\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the core components and likely root cause of the permission inconsistency bug.

When `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`, the resulting files get 0o600 permissions instead of respecting the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n\n**Root Cause**: The `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` (and `tempfile.mkstemp` on Windows) creates files with restrictive 0o600 permissions for security. When these temporary files are moved/renamed to their final location, they retain these restrictive permissions instead of getting the configured `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`.\n\n**Key Locations Identified**:\n1. `django/core/files/temp.py` line 38 - Windows implementation using `tempfile.mkstemp()`\n2. `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py` line 61 - `TemporaryUploadedFile` using `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`\n3. `django/conf/global_settings.py` line 307 - `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` setting\n4. Storage save methods that handle the final file placement\n\nNow I need to examine how the storage system saves files from temporary uploads to understand where permissions should be applied.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_save\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_save' in file (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nLines 49-55:\n  49:             content = File(content, name)\n  50: \n  51:         name = self.get_available_name(name, max_length=max_length)\n  52:         return self._save(name, content)\n  53: \n  54:     # These methods are part of the public API, with default implementations.\n  55: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nLines 223-229:\n 223:     def _open(self, name, mode='rb'):\n 224:         return File(open(self.path(name), mode))\n 225: \n 226:     def _save(self, name, content):\n 227:         full_path = self.path(name)\n 228: \n 229:         # Create any intermediate directories that do not exist.\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nNow let me examine the complete `_save` method in FileSystemStorage to understand how files are saved and where permissions should be applied.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\", \"start_line\": 226, \"end_line\": 270 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nTotal lines: 360\nShowing lines 226-270:\n\n 226:     def _save(self, name, content):\n 227:         full_path = self.path(name)\n 228: \n 229:         # Create any intermediate directories that do not exist.\n 230:         directory = os.path.dirname(full_path)\n 231:         try:\n 232:             if self.directory_permissions_mode is not None:\n 233:                 # os.makedirs applies the global umask, so we reset it,\n 234:                 # for consistency with file_permissions_mode behavior.\n 235:                 old_umask = os.umask(0)\n 236:                 try:\n 237:                     os.makedirs(directory, self.directory_permissions_mode, exist_ok=True)\n 238:                 finally:\n 239:                     os.umask(old_umask)\n 240:             else:\n 241:                 os.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)\n 242:         except FileExistsError:\n 243:             raise FileExistsError('%s exists and is not a directory.' % directory)\n 244: \n 245:         # There's a potential race condition between get_available_name and\n 246:         # saving the file; it's possible that two threads might return the\n 247:         # same name, at which point all sorts of fun happens.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n",

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Django File Upload Permissions Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the Django project related to file upload permissions. The issue involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded, depending on whether they are stored in memory or as temporary files.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a Django framework codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories\n\n### 2. File Upload Permission Settings Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in `django/conf/global_settings.py` (line 307)\n  - Located permission handling in `django/core/files/storage.py` with `file_permissions_mode` property\n  - Discovered extensive test coverage in `tests/file_storage/tests.py` including permission tests\n\n### 3. Upload File Classes Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MemoryUploadedFile\" and \"TemporaryUploadedFile\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found two main upload file classes: `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`\n  - Located in `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py`\n  - Upload handlers in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` create these different file types\n\n### 4. Detailed Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on critical files\n- **Key Technical Details**:\n  - `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for disk storage (line 61 in uploadedfile.py)\n  - `InMemoryUploadedFile` stores files in memory using StringIO/BytesIO\n  - Custom Windows implementation in `django/core/files/temp.py` uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` (line 38)\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Issues Identified\n1. **Permission Inconsistency**: The bug appears to be that `TemporaryUploadedFile` (disk-based) and `InMemoryUploadedFile` (memory-based) handle permissions differently\n2. **Root Cause**: When files are saved from `TemporaryUploadedFile`, the temporary file permissions may not respect the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting, while `InMemoryUploadedFile` would get proper permissions when saved to storage\n\n### Technical Analysis Complete\n- Located all relevant code components\n- Identified the permission flow from settings → storage → upload handlers\n- Found test cases that demonstrate expected behavior\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Examine Storage Save Method**: Need to investigate how `FileSystemStorage.save()` handles permissions differently for the two upload file types\n2. **Create Reproduction Test**: Write a test that demonstrates the permission inconsistency\n3. **Implement Fix**: Likely need to ensure temporary files respect `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting when created or when moved to final location\n4. **Verify Fix**: Run existing permission tests and new reproduction test\n\n## Important Technical Context\n\n- **Settings**: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` controls final file permissions (default: None)\n- **Upload Threshold**: Django switches between memory and disk storage based on file size\n- **Platform Differences**: Windows has custom temporary file implementation\n- **Storage Integration**: Final permissions are applied in the storage layer, not during upload\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the core components and likely root cause of the permission inconsistency bug. The next phase should focus on reproducing the issue and implementing a fix in the storage or upload file handling logic.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: Now let me examine the temp.py file to understand how NamedTemporaryFile is used and where the permission issue occurs.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/temp.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 50 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/temp.py\nTotal lines: 74\nShowing lines 1-50:\n\n   1: \"\"\"\n   2: The temp module provides a NamedTemporaryFile that can be reopened in the same\n   3: process on any platform.

When `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`, the resulting files get 0o600 permissions instead of respecting the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.\n\n**Root Cause**: The `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` (and `tempfile.mkstemp` on Windows) creates files with restrictive 0o600 permissions for security. When these temporary files are moved/renamed to their final location, they retain these restrictive permissions instead of getting the configured `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`.\n\n**Key Locations Identified**:\n1. `django/core/files/temp.py` line 38 - Windows implementation using `tempfile.mkstemp()`\n2. `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py` line 61 - `TemporaryUploadedFile` using `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`\n3. `django/conf/global_settings.py` line 307 - `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` setting\n4. Storage save methods that handle the final file placement\n\nNow I need to examine how the storage system saves files from temporary uploads to understand where permissions should be applied.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"_save\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for '_save' in file (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nLines 49-55:\n  49:             content = File(content, name)\n  50: \n  51:         name = self.get_available_name(name, max_length=max_length)\n  52:         return self._save(name, content)\n  53: \n  54:     # These methods are part of the public API, with default implementations.\n  55: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nLines 223-229:\n 223:     def _open(self, name, mode='rb'):\n 224:         return File(open(self.path(name), mode))\n 225: \n 226:     def _save(self, name, content):\n 227:         full_path = self.path(name)\n 228: \n 229:         # Create any intermediate directories that do not exist.\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: Now let me examine the complete `_save` method in FileSystemStorage to understand how files are saved and where permissions should be applied.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\", \"start_line\": 226, \"end_line\": 270 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nTotal lines: 360\nShowing lines 226-270:\n\n 226:     def _save(self, name, content):\n 227:         full_path = self.path(name)\n 228: \n 229:         # Create any intermediate directories that do not exist.\n 230:         directory = os.path.dirname(full_path)\n 231:         try:\n 232:             if self.directory_permissions_mode is not None:\n 233:                 # os.makedirs applies the global umask, so we reset it,\n 234:                 # for consistency with file_permissions_mode behavior.\n 235:                 old_umask = os.umask(0)\n 236:                 try:\n 237:                     os.makedirs(directory, self.directory_permissions_mode, exist_ok=True)\n 238:                 finally:\n 239:                     os.umask(old_umask)\n 240:             else:\n 241:                 os.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)\n 242:         except FileExistsError:\n 243:             raise FileExistsError('%s exists and is not a directory.' % directory)\n 244: \n 245:         # There's a potential race condition between get_available_name and\n 246:         # saving the file; it's possible that two threads might return the\n 247:         # same name, at which point all sorts of fun happens.

    "response": "# Django File Upload Permissions Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the Django project related to file upload permissions. The issue involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded, depending on whether they are stored in memory or as temporary files.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a Django framework codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories\n\n### 2. File Upload Permission Settings Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in `django/conf/global_settings.py` (line 307)\n  - Located permission handling in `django/core/files/storage.py` with `file_permissions_mode` property\n  - Discovered extensive test coverage in `tests/file_storage/tests.py` including permission tests\n\n### 3. Upload File Classes Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MemoryUploadedFile\" and \"TemporaryUploadedFile\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found two main upload file classes: `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`\n  - Located in `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py`\n  - Upload handlers in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` create these different file types\n\n### 4. Detailed Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on critical files\n- **Key Technical Details**:\n  - `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for disk storage (line 61 in uploadedfile.py)\n  - `InMemoryUploadedFile` stores files in memory using StringIO/BytesIO\n  - Custom Windows implementation in `django/core/files/temp.py` uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` (line 38)\n\n### 5. Deep Dive into Permission Handling Mechanism\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on storage and file movement code\n- **Critical Discoveries**:\n  - **FileSystemStorage._save() method** (lines 226-287 in storage.py):\n    - Line 254-255: Uses `file_move_safe()` when content has `temporary_file_path()` (TemporaryUploadedFile case)\n    - Line 258-274: Uses `os.open()` with 0o666 permissions for streaming content (InMemoryUploadedFile case)\n    - **Line 283-284: CRUCIAL - `os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)` is applied AFTER file operations**\n  \n  - **file_move_safe() function** (lines 30-87 in move.py):\n    - Line 48: First tries `os.rename()` which preserves original file permissions\n    - Line 58-59: Falls back to `os.open()` with default permissions if rename fails\n    - Line 71: Uses `copystat()` to copy metadata from source to destination\n    - **CRITICAL ISSUE**: `copystat()` copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary file\n\n### 6. Root Cause Analysis Complete\n- **The Bug**: When `TemporaryUploadedFile` is saved via `file_move_safe()`:\n  1. Temporary file is created with 0o600 permissions by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`/`tempfile.mkstemp`\n  2. `file_move_safe()` moves the file using `os.rename()` or manual copy\n  3. `copystat()` (line 71 in move.py) copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions to the destination\n  4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` then applies `os.chmod()` with `file_permissions_mode` (line 283-284)\n  5. **However, the `copystat()` call happens AFTER the file is moved but BEFORE the chmod in storage**\n\n- **The Fix Location**: The issue is in the interaction between `file_move_safe()` and `FileSystemStorage._save()`. The `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` overwrites any permissions that should be set by the storage layer.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Issues Identified\n1. **Permission Inconsistency**: `TemporaryUploadedFile` (disk-based) gets 0o600 permissions copied from temporary file, while `InMemoryUploadedFile` (memory-based) gets proper permissions from storage settings\n2. **Root Cause**: `copystat()` in `file_move_safe()` copies restrictive temporary file permissions, interfering with Django's permission management\n3. **Timing Issue**: Permission copying happens after file movement but before Django's intended permission setting\n\n### Technical Analysis Complete\n- Located exact bug location: `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` function (line 71)\n- Identified permission flow: temp file (0o600) → `file_move_safe()` → `copystat()` → `os.chmod()` in storage\n- Found that `InMemoryUploadedFile` path works correctly because it uses `os.open()` with 0o666 and proper chmod\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify `file_move_safe()` to not copy permissions when used in Django's file storage context, or modify `FileSystemStorage._save()` to handle this case\n2. **Create Reproduction Test**: Write a test that demonstrates the permission inconsistency between the two upload file types\n3. **Verify Fix**: Run existing permission tests and new reproduction test\n\n## Important Technical Context\n\n- **Settings**: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` controls final file permissions (default: None)\n- **Upload Threshold**: Django switches between memory and disk storage based on file size\n- **Platform Differences**: Windows has custom temporary file implementation using `tempfile.mkstemp()`\n- **Storage Integration**: Final permissions should be applied in `FileSystemStorage._save()` at line 283-284\n- **Bug Location**: `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` at line 71 interferes with Django's permission management\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the exact root cause and location of the permission inconsistency bug. The issue is in the `file_move_safe()` function's `copystat()` call that copies restrictive temporary file permissions, overriding Django's intended permission management system.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django File Upload Permissions Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the Django project related to file upload permissions. The issue involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded, depending on whether they are stored in memory or as temporary files.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a Django framework codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories\n\n### 2. File Upload Permission Settings Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in `django/conf/global_settings.py` (line 307)\n  - Located permission handling in `django/core/files/storage.py` with `file_permissions_mode` property\n  - Discovered extensive test coverage in `tests/file_storage/tests.py` including permission tests\n\n### 3. Upload File Classes Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MemoryUploadedFile\" and \"TemporaryUploadedFile\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found two main upload file classes: `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`\n  - Located in `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py`\n  - Upload handlers in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` create these different file types\n\n### 4. Detailed Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on critical files\n- **Key Technical Details**:\n  - `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for disk storage (line 61 in uploadedfile.py)\n  - `InMemoryUploadedFile` stores files in memory using StringIO/BytesIO\n  - Custom Windows implementation in `django/core/files/temp.py` uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` (line 38)\n\n### 5. Deep Dive into Permission Handling Mechanism\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on storage and file movement code\n- **Critical Discoveries**:\n  - **FileSystemStorage._save() method** (lines 226-287 in storage.py):\n    - Line 254-255: Uses `file_move_safe()` when content has `temporary_file_path()` (TemporaryUploadedFile case)\n    - Line 258-274: Uses `os.open()` with 0o666 permissions for streaming content (InMemoryUploadedFile case)\n    - **Line 283-284: CRUCIAL - `os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)` is applied AFTER file operations**\n  \n  - **file_move_safe() function** (lines 30-87 in move.py):\n    - Line 48: First tries `os.rename()` which preserves original file permissions\n    - Line 58-59: Falls back to `os.open()` with default permissions if rename fails\n    - Line 71: Uses `copystat()` to copy metadata from source to destination\n    - **CRITICAL ISSUE**: `copystat()` copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary file\n\n### 6. Root Cause Analysis Complete\n- **The Bug**: When `TemporaryUploadedFile` is saved via `file_move_safe()`:\n  1. Temporary file is created with 0o600 permissions by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`/`tempfile.mkstemp`\n  2. `file_move_safe()` moves the file using `os.rename()` or manual copy\n  3. `copystat()` (line 71 in move.py) copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions to the destination\n  4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` then applies `os.chmod()` with `file_permissions_mode` (line 283-284)\n  5. **However, the `copystat()` call happens AFTER the file is moved but BEFORE the chmod in storage**\n\n- **The Fix Location**: The issue is in the interaction between `file_move_safe()` and `FileSystemStorage._save()`. The `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` overwrites any permissions that should be set by the storage layer.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Issues Identified\n1. **Permission Inconsistency**: `TemporaryUploadedFile` (disk-based) gets 0o600 permissions copied from temporary file, while `InMemoryUploadedFile` (memory-based) gets proper permissions from storage settings\n2. **Root Cause**: `copystat()` in `file_move_safe()` copies restrictive temporary file permissions, interfering with Django's permission management\n3. **Timing Issue**: Permission copying happens after file movement but before Django's intended permission setting\n\n### Technical Analysis Complete\n- Located exact bug location: `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` function (line 71)\n- Identified permission flow: temp file (0o600) → `file_move_safe()` → `copystat()` → `os.chmod()` in storage\n- Found that `InMemoryUploadedFile` path works correctly because it uses `os.open()` with 0o666 and proper chmod\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify `file_move_safe()` to not copy permissions when used in Django's file storage context, or modify `FileSystemStorage._save()` to handle this case\n2. **Create Reproduction Test**: Write a test that demonstrates the permission inconsistency between the two upload file types\n3. **Verify Fix**: Run existing permission tests and new reproduction test\n\n## Important Technical Context\n\n- **Settings**: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` controls final file permissions (default: None)\n- **Upload Threshold**: Django switches between memory and disk storage based on file size\n- **Platform Differences**: Windows has custom temporary file implementation using `tempfile.mkstemp()`\n- **Storage Integration**: Final permissions should be applied in `FileSystemStorage._save()` at line 283-284\n- **Bug Location**: `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` at line 71 interferes with Django's permission management\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the exact root cause and location of the permission inconsistency bug.

What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the ​File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django File Upload Permissions Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the Django project related to file upload permissions. The issue involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded, depending on whether they are stored in memory or as temporary files.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a Django framework codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories\n\n### 2. File Upload Permission Settings Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in `django/conf/global_settings.py` (line 307)\n  - Located permission handling in `django/core/files/storage.py` with `file_permissions_mode` property\n  - Discovered extensive test coverage in `tests/file_storage/tests.py` including permission tests\n\n### 3. Upload File Classes Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MemoryUploadedFile\" and \"TemporaryUploadedFile\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found two main upload file classes: `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`\n  - Located in `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py`\n  - Upload handlers in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` create these different file types\n\n### 4. Detailed Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on critical files\n- **Key Technical Details**:\n  - `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for disk storage (line 61 in uploadedfile.py)\n  - `InMemoryUploadedFile` stores files in memory using StringIO/BytesIO\n  - Custom Windows implementation in `django/core/files/temp.py` uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` (line 38)\n\n### 5. Deep Dive into Permission Handling Mechanism\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on storage and file movement code\n- **Critical Discoveries**:\n  - **FileSystemStorage._save() method** (lines 226-287 in storage.py):\n    - Line 254-255: Uses `file_move_safe()` when content has `temporary_file_path()` (TemporaryUploadedFile case)\n    - Line 258-274: Uses `os.open()` with 0o666 permissions for streaming content (InMemoryUploadedFile case)\n    - **Line 283-284: CRUCIAL - `os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)` is applied AFTER file operations**\n  \n  - **file_move_safe() function** (lines 30-87 in move.py):\n    - Line 48: First tries `os.rename()` which preserves original file permissions\n    - Line 58-59: Falls back to `os.open()` with default permissions if rename fails\n    - Line 71: Uses `copystat()` to copy metadata from source to destination\n    - **CRITICAL ISSUE**: `copystat()` copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary file\n\n### 6. Root Cause Analysis Complete\n- **The Bug**: When `TemporaryUploadedFile` is saved via `file_move_safe()`:\n  1. Temporary file is created with 0o600 permissions by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`/`tempfile.mkstemp`\n  2. `file_move_safe()` moves the file using `os.rename()` or manual copy\n  3. `copystat()` (line 71 in move.py) copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions to the destination\n  4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` then applies `os.chmod()` with `file_permissions_mode` (line 283-284)\n  5. **However, the `copystat()` call happens AFTER the file is moved but BEFORE the chmod in storage**\n\n- **The Fix Location**: The issue is in the interaction between `file_move_safe()` and `FileSystemStorage._save()`. The `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` overwrites any permissions that should be set by the storage layer.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Issues Identified\n1. **Permission Inconsistency**: `TemporaryUploadedFile` (disk-based) gets 0o600 permissions copied from temporary file, while `InMemoryUploadedFile` (memory-based) gets proper permissions from storage settings\n2. **Root Cause**: `copystat()` in `file_move_safe()` copies restrictive temporary file permissions, interfering with Django's permission management\n3. **Timing Issue**: Permission copying happens after file movement but before Django's intended permission setting\n\n### Technical Analysis Complete\n- Located exact bug location: `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` function (line 71)\n- Identified permission flow: temp file (0o600) → `file_move_safe()` → `copystat()` → `os.chmod()` in storage\n- Found that `InMemoryUploadedFile` path works correctly because it uses `os.open()` with 0o666 and proper chmod\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify `file_move_safe()` to not copy permissions when used in Django's file storage context, or modify `FileSystemStorage._save()` to handle this case\n2. **Create Reproduction Test**: Write a test that demonstrates the permission inconsistency between the two upload file types\n3. **Verify Fix**: Run existing permission tests and new reproduction test\n\n## Important Technical Context\n\n- **Settings**: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` controls final file permissions (default: None)\n- **Upload Threshold**: Django switches between memory and disk storage based on file size\n- **Platform Differences**: Windows has custom temporary file implementation using `tempfile.mkstemp()`\n- **Storage Integration**: Final permissions should be applied in `FileSystemStorage._save()` at line 283-284\n- **Bug Location**: `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` at line 71 interferes with Django's permission management\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the exact root cause and location of the permission inconsistency bug. The issue is in the `file_move_safe()` function's `copystat()` call that copies restrictive temporary file permissions, overriding Django's intended permission management system.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine the `file_move_safe` function implementation to understand how it handles file permissions.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\", \"start_line\": 30, \"end_line\": 80 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\nTotal lines: 87\nShowing lines 30-79:\n\n  30: def file_move_safe(old_file_name, new_file_name, chunk_size=1024 * 64, allow_overwrite=False):\n  31:     \"\"\"\n  32:     Move a file from one location to another in the safest way possible.\n  33: \n  34:     First, try ``os.rename``, which is simple but will break across filesystems.\n  35:     If that fails, stream manually from one file to another in pure Python.\n  36: \n  37:     If the destination file exists and ``allow_overwrite`` is ``False``, raise\n  38:     ``FileExistsError``.\n  39:     \"\"\"\n  40:     # There's no reason to move if we don't have to.\n  41:     if _samefile(old_file_name, new_file_name):\n  42:         return\n  43: \n  44:     try:\n  45:         if not allow_overwrite and os.access(new_file_name, os.F_OK):\n  46:             raise FileExistsError('Destination file %s exists and allow_overwrite is False.' % new_file_name)\n  47: \n  48:         os.rename(old_file_name, new_file_name)\n  49:         return\n  50:     except OSError:\n  51:         # OSError happens with os.rename() if moving to another filesystem or\n  52:         # when moving opened files on certain operating systems.\n  53:         pass\n  54: \n  55:     # first open the old file, so that it won't go away\n  56:     with open(old_file_name, 'rb') as old_file:\n  57:         # now open the new file, not forgetting allow_overwrite\n  58:         fd = os.open(new_file_name, (os.O_WRONLY | os.O_CREAT | getattr(os, 'O_BINARY', 0) |\n  59:                                      (os.O_EXCL if not allow_overwrite else 0)))\n  60:         try:\n  61:             locks.lock(fd, locks.LOCK_EX)\n  62:             current_chunk = None\n  63:             while current_chunk != b'':\n  64:                 current_chunk = old_file.read(chunk_size)\n  65:                 os.write(fd, current_chunk)\n  66:         finally:\n  67:             locks.unlock(fd)\n  68:             os.close(fd)\n  69: \n  70:     try:\n  71:         copystat(old_file_name, new_file_name)\n  72:     except PermissionError as e:\n  73:         # Certain filesystems (e.g. CIFS) fail to copy the file's metadata if\n  74:         # the type of the destination filesystem isn't the same as the source\n  75:         # filesystem; ignore that.\n  76:         if e.errno != errno.EPERM:\n  77:             raise\n  78: \n  79:     try:\n\nNow let me examine the rest of the `file_move_safe` function to see how it handles file cleanup.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\", \"start_line\": 79, \"end_line\": 87 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\nTotal lines: 87\nShowing lines 79-87:\n\n  79:     try:\n  80:         os.remove(old_file_name)\n  81:     except PermissionError as e:\n  82:         # Certain operating systems (Cygwin and Windows)\n  83:         # fail when deleting opened files, ignore it.

The issue is that `TemporaryUploadedFile` results in files with 0o600 permissions while `InMemoryUploadedFile` gets proper permissions, creating inconsistent behavior.\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**Root Cause**: The `file_move_safe()` function calls `copystat()` which copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary files to the final destination, overriding Django's intended permission management.\n\n**Flow**:\n1. `TemporaryUploadedFile` creates temp file with 0o600 permissions (security default)\n2. `FileSystemStorage._save()` calls `file_move_safe()` to move temp file (line 255)\n3. `file_move_safe()` copies file and then calls `copystat()` (line 71) which copies 0o600 permissions\n4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` applies correct permissions with `os.chmod()` (line 284), but this happens after `copystat()` has already set restrictive permissions\n\n## Bug Locations\n\n**Location 1: django/core/files/move.py, lines 70-77**\nThe `copystat()` call that copies restrictive temporary file permissions to the destination file, interfering with Django's permission management system.\n\n**Location 2: django/core/files/storage.py, lines 254-255** \nThe call to `file_move_safe()` for `TemporaryUploadedFile` that triggers the permission copying issue.\n\n**Location 3: django/core/files/storage.py, lines 283-284**\nThe intended permission setting that gets overridden by the earlier `copystat()` call.\n\n**Location 4: django/conf/global_settings.py, line 307**\nThe default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` setting that should be changed to 0o644 as requested.\n\n**Location 5: django/core/files/storage.py, lines 258-274**\nThe `InMemoryUploadedFile` code path that works correctly, showing the intended behavior for comparison.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the ​File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list. It must follow the following structure:  example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/viewcode.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 181,\n            \"end_line\": 276\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/viewcode.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 160,\n            \"end_line\": 178\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n                ",

The issue is not just about fixing a bug, but specifically about setting the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to 0o644 to address the inconsistent permissions between `MemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`.\n\nThe problem is:\n1. When `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is `None` (default), file permissions are inconsistent\n2. `MemoryUploadedFile` results in one set of permissions\n3. `TemporaryUploadedFile` results in 0o600 permissions due to temporary file creation + `os.rename`/`copystat`\n4.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django File Upload Permissions Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the Django project related to file upload permissions. The issue involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded, depending on whether they are stored in memory or as temporary files.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a Django framework codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories\n\n### 2. File Upload Permission Settings Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in `django/conf/global_settings.py` (line 307)\n  - Located permission handling in `django/core/files/storage.py` with `file_permissions_mode` property\n  - Discovered extensive test coverage in `tests/file_storage/tests.py` including permission tests\n\n### 3. Upload File Classes Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MemoryUploadedFile\" and \"TemporaryUploadedFile\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found two main upload file classes: `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`\n  - Located in `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py`\n  - Upload handlers in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` create these different file types\n\n### 4. Detailed Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on critical files\n- **Key Technical Details**:\n  - `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for disk storage (line 61 in uploadedfile.py)\n  - `InMemoryUploadedFile` stores files in memory using StringIO/BytesIO\n  - Custom Windows implementation in `django/core/files/temp.py` uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` (line 38)\n\n### 5. Deep Dive into Permission Handling Mechanism\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on storage and file movement code\n- **Critical Discoveries**:\n  - **FileSystemStorage._save() method** (lines 226-287 in storage.py):\n    - Line 254-255: Uses `file_move_safe()` when content has `temporary_file_path()` (TemporaryUploadedFile case)\n    - Line 258-274: Uses `os.open()` with 0o666 permissions for streaming content (InMemoryUploadedFile case)\n    - **Line 283-284: CRUCIAL - `os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)` is applied AFTER file operations**\n  \n  - **file_move_safe() function** (lines 30-87 in move.py):\n    - Line 48: First tries `os.rename()` which preserves original file permissions\n    - Line 58-59: Falls back to `os.open()` with default permissions if rename fails\n    - Line 71: Uses `copystat()` to copy metadata from source to destination\n    - **CRITICAL ISSUE**: `copystat()` copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary file\n\n### 6. Root Cause Analysis Complete\n- **The Bug**: When `TemporaryUploadedFile` is saved via `file_move_safe()`:\n  1. Temporary file is created with 0o600 permissions by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`/`tempfile.mkstemp`\n  2. `file_move_safe()` moves the file using `os.rename()` or manual copy\n  3. `copystat()` (line 71 in move.py) copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions to the destination\n  4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` then applies `os.chmod()` with `file_permissions_mode` (line 283-284)\n  5. **However, the `copystat()` call happens AFTER the file is moved but BEFORE the chmod in storage**\n\n- **The Fix Location**: The issue is in the interaction between `file_move_safe()` and `FileSystemStorage._save()`. The `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` overwrites any permissions that should be set by the storage layer.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Issues Identified\n1. **Permission Inconsistency**: `TemporaryUploadedFile` (disk-based) gets 0o600 permissions copied from temporary file, while `InMemoryUploadedFile` (memory-based) gets proper permissions from storage settings\n2. **Root Cause**: `copystat()` in `file_move_safe()` copies restrictive temporary file permissions, interfering with Django's permission management\n3. **Timing Issue**: Permission copying happens after file movement but before Django's intended permission setting\n\n### Technical Analysis Complete\n- Located exact bug location: `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` function (line 71)\n- Identified permission flow: temp file (0o600) → `file_move_safe()` → `copystat()` → `os.chmod()` in storage\n- Found that `InMemoryUploadedFile` path works correctly because it uses `os.open()` with 0o666 and proper chmod\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify `file_move_safe()` to not copy permissions when used in Django's file storage context, or modify `FileSystemStorage._save()` to handle this case\n2. **Create Reproduction Test**: Write a test that demonstrates the permission inconsistency between the two upload file types\n3. **Verify Fix**: Run existing permission tests and new reproduction test\n\n## Important Technical Context\n\n- **Settings**: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` controls final file permissions (default: None)\n- **Upload Threshold**: Django switches between memory and disk storage based on file size\n- **Platform Differences**: Windows has custom temporary file implementation using `tempfile.mkstemp()`\n- **Storage Integration**: Final permissions should be applied in `FileSystemStorage._save()` at line 283-284\n- **Bug Location**: `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` at line 71 interferes with Django's permission management\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the exact root cause and location of the permission inconsistency bug. The issue is in the `file_move_safe()` function's `copystat()` call that copies restrictive temporary file permissions, overriding Django's intended permission management system.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/conf/global_settings.py\nStart line: 307\nEnd line: 307\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nStart line: 283\nEnd line: 284\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\nStart line: 70\nEnd line: 77\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nStart line: 254\nEnd line: 255\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nStart line: 258\nEnd line: 274\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine the `file_move_safe` function implementation to understand how it handles file permissions.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\", \"start_line\": 30, \"end_line\": 80 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\nTotal lines: 87\nShowing lines 30-79:\n\n  30: def file_move_safe(old_file_name, new_file_name, chunk_size=1024 * 64, allow_overwrite=False):\n  31:     \"\"\"\n  32:     Move a file from one location to another in the safest way possible.\n  33: \n  34:     First, try ``os.rename``, which is simple but will break across filesystems.\n  35:     If that fails, stream manually from one file to another in pure Python.\n  36: \n  37:     If the destination file exists and ``allow_overwrite`` is ``False``, raise\n  38:     ``FileExistsError``.\n  39:     \"\"\"\n  40:     # There's no reason to move if we don't have to.\n  41:     if _samefile(old_file_name, new_file_name):\n  42:         return\n  43: \n  44:     try:\n  45:         if not allow_overwrite and os.access(new_file_name, os.F_OK):\n  46:             raise FileExistsError('Destination file %s exists and allow_overwrite is False.' % new_file_name)\n  47: \n  48:         os.rename(old_file_name, new_file_name)\n  49:         return\n  50:     except OSError:\n  51:         # OSError happens with os.rename() if moving to another filesystem or\n  52:         # when moving opened files on certain operating systems.\n  53:         pass\n  54: \n  55:     # first open the old file, so that it won't go away\n  56:     with open(old_file_name, 'rb') as old_file:\n  57:         # now open the new file, not forgetting allow_overwrite\n  58:         fd = os.open(new_file_name, (os.O_WRONLY | os.O_CREAT | getattr(os, 'O_BINARY', 0) |\n  59:                                      (os.O_EXCL if not allow_overwrite else 0)))\n  60:         try:\n  61:             locks.lock(fd, locks.LOCK_EX)\n  62:             current_chunk = None\n  63:             while current_chunk != b'':\n  64:                 current_chunk = old_file.read(chunk_size)\n  65:                 os.write(fd, current_chunk)\n  66:         finally:\n  67:             locks.unlock(fd)\n  68:             os.close(fd)\n  69: \n  70:     try:\n  71:         copystat(old_file_name, new_file_name)\n  72:     except PermissionError as e:\n  73:         # Certain filesystems (e.g. CIFS) fail to copy the file's metadata if\n  74:         # the type of the destination filesystem isn't the same as the source\n  75:         # filesystem; ignore that.\n  76:         if e.errno != errno.EPERM:\n  77:             raise\n  78: \n  79:     try:\n\nNow let me examine the rest of the `file_move_safe` function to see how it handles file cleanup.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\", \"start_line\": 79, \"end_line\": 87 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\nTotal lines: 87\nShowing lines 79-87:\n\n  79:     try:\n  80:         os.remove(old_file_name)\n  81:     except PermissionError as e:\n  82:         # Certain operating systems (Cygwin and Windows)\n  83:         # fail when deleting opened files, ignore it.

When `TemporaryUploadedFile` is used, the final file gets restrictive 0o600 permissions instead of the intended permissions.\n\n**Root Cause**: In `file_move_safe()` function at line 71, `copystat(old_file_name, new_file_name)` copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from the temporary file to the destination file. This happens after the file is moved but before Django's storage layer can apply the correct permissions via `os.chmod()` in `FileSystemStorage._save()`.\n\n**The Flow**:\n1. `TemporaryUploadedFile` creates temp file with 0o600 permissions (security default)\n2. `FileSystemStorage._save()` calls `file_move_safe()` to move the temp file\n3. `file_move_safe()` moves the file and then calls `copystat()` which copies the 0o600 permissions\n4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` then tries to apply correct permissions with `os.chmod()`, but the damage is done\n\n**The Fix**: The issue is that `copystat()` should not copy file permissions when Django's storage system is managing permissions. The fix should be in the `file_move_safe()` function to avoid copying permissions, or modify how it's called from the storage layer.\n\nLet me examine the exact location where `file_move_safe()` is called from `FileSystemStorage._save()` to understand the context better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\", \"start_line\": 250, \"end_line\": 290 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nTotal lines: 360\nShowing lines 250-290:\n\n 250: \n 251:         while True:\n 252:             try:\n 253:                 # This file has a file path that we can move.\n 254:                 if hasattr(content, 'temporary_file_path'):\n 255:                     file_move_safe(content.temporary_file_path(), full_path)\n 256: \n 257:                 # This is a normal uploadedfile that we can stream.\n 258:                 else:\n 259:                     # The current umask value is masked out by os.open!\n 260:                     fd = os.open(full_path, self.OS_OPEN_FLAGS, 0o666)\n 261:                     _file = None\n 262:                     try:\n 263:                         locks.lock(fd, locks.LOCK_EX)\n 264:                         for chunk in content.chunks():\n 265:                             if _file is None:\n 266:                                 mode = 'wb' if isinstance(chunk, bytes) else 'wt'\n 267:                                 _file = os.fdopen(fd, mode)\n 268:                             _file.write(chunk)\n 269:                     finally:\n 270:                         locks.unlock(fd)\n 271:                         if _file is not None:\n 272:                             _file.close()\n 273:                         else:\n 274:                             os.close(fd)\n 275:             except FileExistsError:\n 276:                 # A new name is needed if the file exists.\n 277:                 name = self.get_available_name(name)\n 278:                 full_path = self.path(name)\n 279:             else:\n 280:                 # OK, the file save worked.

The issue is that `TemporaryUploadedFile` results in files with 0o600 permissions while `InMemoryUploadedFile` gets proper permissions, creating inconsistent behavior.\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**Root Cause**: The `file_move_safe()` function calls `copystat()` which copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary files to the final destination, overriding Django's intended permission management.\n\n**Flow**:\n1. `TemporaryUploadedFile` creates temp file with 0o600 permissions (security default)\n2. `FileSystemStorage._save()` calls `file_move_safe()` to move temp file (line 255)\n3. `file_move_safe()` copies file and then calls `copystat()` (line 71) which copies 0o600 permissions\n4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` applies correct permissions with `os.chmod()` (line 284), but this happens after `copystat()` has already set restrictive permissions\n\n## Bug Locations\n\n**Location 1: django/core/files/move.py, lines 70-77**\nThe `copystat()` call that copies restrictive temporary file permissions to the destination file, interfering with Django's permission management system.\n\n**Location 2: django/core/files/storage.py, lines 254-255** \nThe call to `file_move_safe()` for `TemporaryUploadedFile` that triggers the permission copying issue.\n\n**Location 3: django/core/files/storage.py, lines 283-284**\nThe intended permission setting that gets overridden by the earlier `copystat()` call.\n\n**Location 4: django/conf/global_settings.py, line 307**\nThe default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` setting that should be changed to 0o644 as requested.\n\n**Location 5: django/core/files/storage.py, lines 258-274**\nThe `InMemoryUploadedFile` code path that works correctly, showing the intended behavior for comparison.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the actual problem statement. The issue is not just about fixing a bug, but specifically about setting the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to 0o644 to address the inconsistent permissions between `MemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`.\n\nThe problem is:\n1. When `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is `None` (default), file permissions are inconsistent\n2. `MemoryUploadedFile` results in one set of permissions\n3. `TemporaryUploadedFile` results in 0o600 permissions due to temporary file creation + `os.rename`/`copystat`\n4. The solution is to set a default value of 0o644 for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n\nThe key locations to fix this are:\n1. The default setting in `global_settings.py`\n2. The permission handling logic in `FileSystemStorage._save()`\n3. The `file_move_safe()` function that causes the inconsistency\n4. Any related permission handling code\n\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/conf/global_settings.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 307,\n            \"end_line\": 307\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 283,\n            \"end_line\": 284\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 70,\n            \"end_line\": 77\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 254,\n            \"end_line\": 255\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 258,\n            \"end_line\": 274\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe problem statement the project is:\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the ​File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5).

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django File Upload Permissions Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the Django project related to file upload permissions. The issue involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded, depending on whether they are stored in memory or as temporary files.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a Django framework codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories\n\n### 2. File Upload Permission Settings Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in `django/conf/global_settings.py` (line 307)\n  - Located permission handling in `django/core/files/storage.py` with `file_permissions_mode` property\n  - Discovered extensive test coverage in `tests/file_storage/tests.py` including permission tests\n\n### 3. Upload File Classes Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MemoryUploadedFile\" and \"TemporaryUploadedFile\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found two main upload file classes: `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`\n  - Located in `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py`\n  - Upload handlers in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` create these different file types\n\n### 4. Detailed Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on critical files\n- **Key Technical Details**:\n  - `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for disk storage (line 61 in uploadedfile.py)\n  - `InMemoryUploadedFile` stores files in memory using StringIO/BytesIO\n  - Custom Windows implementation in `django/core/files/temp.py` uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` (line 38)\n\n### 5. Deep Dive into Permission Handling Mechanism\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on storage and file movement code\n- **Critical Discoveries**:\n  - **FileSystemStorage._save() method** (lines 226-287 in storage.py):\n    - Line 254-255: Uses `file_move_safe()` when content has `temporary_file_path()` (TemporaryUploadedFile case)\n    - Line 258-274: Uses `os.open()` with 0o666 permissions for streaming content (InMemoryUploadedFile case)\n    - **Line 283-284: CRUCIAL - `os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)` is applied AFTER file operations**\n  \n  - **file_move_safe() function** (lines 30-87 in move.py):\n    - Line 48: First tries `os.rename()` which preserves original file permissions\n    - Line 58-59: Falls back to `os.open()` with default permissions if rename fails\n    - Line 71: Uses `copystat()` to copy metadata from source to destination\n    - **CRITICAL ISSUE**: `copystat()` copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary file\n\n### 6. Root Cause Analysis Complete\n- **The Bug**: When `TemporaryUploadedFile` is saved via `file_move_safe()`:\n  1. Temporary file is created with 0o600 permissions by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`/`tempfile.mkstemp`\n  2. `file_move_safe()` moves the file using `os.rename()` or manual copy\n  3. `copystat()` (line 71 in move.py) copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions to the destination\n  4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` then applies `os.chmod()` with `file_permissions_mode` (line 283-284)\n  5. **However, the `copystat()` call happens AFTER the file is moved but BEFORE the chmod in storage**\n\n- **The Fix Location**: The issue is in the interaction between `file_move_safe()` and `FileSystemStorage._save()`. The `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` overwrites any permissions that should be set by the storage layer.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Issues Identified\n1. **Permission Inconsistency**: `TemporaryUploadedFile` (disk-based) gets 0o600 permissions copied from temporary file, while `InMemoryUploadedFile` (memory-based) gets proper permissions from storage settings\n2. **Root Cause**: `copystat()` in `file_move_safe()` copies restrictive temporary file permissions, interfering with Django's permission management\n3. **Timing Issue**: Permission copying happens after file movement but before Django's intended permission setting\n\n### Technical Analysis Complete\n- Located exact bug location: `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` function (line 71)\n- Identified permission flow: temp file (0o600) → `file_move_safe()` → `copystat()` → `os.chmod()` in storage\n- Found that `InMemoryUploadedFile` path works correctly because it uses `os.open()` with 0o666 and proper chmod\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify `file_move_safe()` to not copy permissions when used in Django's file storage context, or modify `FileSystemStorage._save()` to handle this case\n2. **Create Reproduction Test**: Write a test that demonstrates the permission inconsistency between the two upload file types\n3. **Verify Fix**: Run existing permission tests and new reproduction test\n\n## Important Technical Context\n\n- **Settings**: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` controls final file permissions (default: None)\n- **Upload Threshold**: Django switches between memory and disk storage based on file size\n- **Platform Differences**: Windows has custom temporary file implementation using `tempfile.mkstemp()`\n- **Storage Integration**: Final permissions should be applied in `FileSystemStorage._save()` at line 283-284\n- **Bug Location**: `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` at line 71 interferes with Django's permission management\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the exact root cause and location of the permission inconsistency bug. The issue is in the `file_move_safe()` function's `copystat()` call that copies restrictive temporary file permissions, overriding Django's intended permission management system.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/conf/global_settings.py\nStart line: 307\nEnd line: 307\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nStart line: 283\nEnd line: 284\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\nStart line: 70\nEnd line: 77\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nStart line: 254\nEnd line: 255\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nStart line: 258\nEnd line: 274\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture.

When `TemporaryUploadedFile` is used, the final file gets restrictive 0o600 permissions instead of the intended permissions.\n\n**Root Cause**: In `file_move_safe()` function at line 71, `copystat(old_file_name, new_file_name)` copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from the temporary file to the destination file. This happens after the file is moved but before Django's storage layer can apply the correct permissions via `os.chmod()` in `FileSystemStorage._save()`.\n\n**The Flow**:\n1. `TemporaryUploadedFile` creates temp file with 0o600 permissions (security default)\n2. `FileSystemStorage._save()` calls `file_move_safe()` to move the temp file\n3. `file_move_safe()` moves the file and then calls `copystat()` which copies the 0o600 permissions\n4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` then tries to apply correct permissions with `os.chmod()`, but the damage is done\n\n**The Fix**: The issue is that `copystat()` should not copy file permissions when Django's storage system is managing permissions. The fix should be in the `file_move_safe()` function to avoid copying permissions, or modify how it's called from the storage layer.\n\nLet me examine the exact location where `file_move_safe()` is called from `FileSystemStorage._save()` to understand the context better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\", \"start_line\": 250, \"end_line\": 290 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nTotal lines: 360\nShowing lines 250-290:\n\n 250: \n 251:         while True:\n 252:             try:\n 253:                 # This file has a file path that we can move.\n 254:                 if hasattr(content, 'temporary_file_path'):\n 255:                     file_move_safe(content.temporary_file_path(), full_path)\n 256: \n 257:                 # This is a normal uploadedfile that we can stream.\n 258:                 else:\n 259:                     # The current umask value is masked out by os.open!\n 260:                     fd = os.open(full_path, self.OS_OPEN_FLAGS, 0o666)\n 261:                     _file = None\n 262:                     try:\n 263:                         locks.lock(fd, locks.LOCK_EX)\n 264:                         for chunk in content.chunks():\n 265:                             if _file is None:\n 266:                                 mode = 'wb' if isinstance(chunk, bytes) else 'wt'\n 267:                                 _file = os.fdopen(fd, mode)\n 268:                             _file.write(chunk)\n 269:                     finally:\n 270:                         locks.unlock(fd)\n 271:                         if _file is not None:\n 272:                             _file.close()\n 273:                         else:\n 274:                             os.close(fd)\n 275:             except FileExistsError:\n 276:                 # A new name is needed if the file exists.\n 277:                 name = self.get_available_name(name)\n 278:                 full_path = self.path(name)\n 279:             else:\n 280:                 # OK, the file save worked.

The issue is that `TemporaryUploadedFile` results in files with 0o600 permissions while `InMemoryUploadedFile` gets proper permissions, creating inconsistent behavior.\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**Root Cause**: The `file_move_safe()` function calls `copystat()` which copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary files to the final destination, overriding Django's intended permission management.\n\n**Flow**:\n1. `TemporaryUploadedFile` creates temp file with 0o600 permissions (security default)\n2. `FileSystemStorage._save()` calls `file_move_safe()` to move temp file (line 255)\n3. `file_move_safe()` copies file and then calls `copystat()` (line 71) which copies 0o600 permissions\n4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` applies correct permissions with `os.chmod()` (line 284), but this happens after `copystat()` has already set restrictive permissions\n\n## Bug Locations\n\n**Location 1: django/core/files/move.py, lines 70-77**\nThe `copystat()` call that copies restrictive temporary file permissions to the destination file, interfering with Django's permission management system.\n\n**Location 2: django/core/files/storage.py, lines 254-255** \nThe call to `file_move_safe()` for `TemporaryUploadedFile` that triggers the permission copying issue.\n\n**Location 3: django/core/files/storage.py, lines 283-284**\nThe intended permission setting that gets overridden by the earlier `copystat()` call.\n\n**Location 4: django/conf/global_settings.py, line 307**\nThe default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` setting that should be changed to 0o644 as requested.\n\n**Location 5: django/core/files/storage.py, lines 258-274**\nThe `InMemoryUploadedFile` code path that works correctly, showing the intended behavior for comparison.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the actual problem statement. The issue is not just about fixing a bug, but specifically about setting the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to 0o644 to address the inconsistent permissions between `MemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`.\n\nThe problem is:\n1. When `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is `None` (default), file permissions are inconsistent\n2. `MemoryUploadedFile` results in one set of permissions\n3. `TemporaryUploadedFile` results in 0o600 permissions due to temporary file creation + `os.rename`/`copystat`\n4. The solution is to set a default value of 0o644 for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n\nThe key locations to fix this are:\n1. The default setting in `global_settings.py`\n2. The permission handling logic in `FileSystemStorage._save()`\n3. The `file_move_safe()` function that causes the inconsistency\n4. Any related permission handling code\n\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/conf/global_settings.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 307,\n            \"end_line\": 307\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 283,\n            \"end_line\": 284\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 70,\n            \"end_line\": 77\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 254,\n            \"end_line\": 255\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 258,\n            \"end_line\": 274\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture. The problem is that when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is `None` (the default), uploaded files get inconsistent permissions:\n\n1. **MemoryUploadedFile** (small files): Get reasonable permissions (likely 0o644 or similar)\n2. **TemporaryUploadedFile** (large files): Get restrictive 0o600 permissions due to `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` + `os.rename`/`copystat` sequence\n\nThe solution is to set a default value of 0o644 for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` so that all uploaded files get consistent, reasonable permissions regardless of their storage method.\n\nLooking at the suspicious locations provided by the locator, I can see they've identified the key areas:\n1. The default setting location\n2. The permission application logic\n3. The file move logic that causes the inconsistency\n4. Both code paths (memory vs temporary file)\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **django/conf/global_settings.py (line 307)**: Change `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` to `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644` to provide a consistent default that ensures all uploaded files get reasonable permissions regardless of whether they use memory or temporary file storage.\n\n2. **django/core/files/storage.py (lines 283-284)**: The permission application logic is correct - it applies `file_permissions_mode` when not None.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n",
    "response": "Looking at the provided code segments and the problem statement, I can see that these locations are indeed the right places to address the file upload permissions inconsistency issue.\n\n**Analysis of the locations:**\n\n1. **Location 1** (`global_settings.py` line 307): This is where `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` is set as the default. This is the primary location that needs to be changed to `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644` to solve the inconsistency problem.\n\n2. **Location 2** (`storage.py` lines 283-284): This shows the permission application logic that works correctly when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` has a value. Once we set the default to 0o644, this code will ensure consistent permissions are applied.\n\n3. **Location 3** (`move.py` lines 70-77): This shows the `copystat()` call that copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary files. While this is part of the problem, it becomes irrelevant once we have a default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` value because the subsequent `os.chmod()` will override these permissions.\n\n4. **Location 4** (`storage.py` lines 254-255): This shows where `file_move_safe()` is called for `TemporaryUploadedFile`, which triggers the permission copying issue. With the default permission set, this path will work consistently.\n\n5. **Location 5** (`storage.py` lines 258-274): This shows the `InMemoryUploadedFile` code path that already works correctly and will continue to work with the new default.\n\nThe problem statement is clear: \"Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644\" to address the inconsistency between `MemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile` permissions. The primary fix is simply changing the default value in `global_settings.py`, and the other locations show the supporting infrastructure that will work correctly once this change is made.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**",

The issue involves inconsistent file permissions when files are uploaded, depending on whether they are stored in memory or as temporary files.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django`\n- **Result**: Identified this is a Django framework codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, `docs/` directories\n\n### 2. File Upload Permission Settings Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` in `django/conf/global_settings.py` (line 307)\n  - Located permission handling in `django/core/files/storage.py` with `file_permissions_mode` property\n  - Discovered extensive test coverage in `tests/file_storage/tests.py` including permission tests\n\n### 3. Upload File Classes Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MemoryUploadedFile\" and \"TemporaryUploadedFile\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found two main upload file classes: `InMemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`\n  - Located in `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py`\n  - Upload handlers in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` create these different file types\n\n### 4. Detailed Code Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on critical files\n- **Key Technical Details**:\n  - `TemporaryUploadedFile` uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for disk storage (line 61 in uploadedfile.py)\n  - `InMemoryUploadedFile` stores files in memory using StringIO/BytesIO\n  - Custom Windows implementation in `django/core/files/temp.py` uses `tempfile.mkstemp()` (line 38)\n\n### 5. Deep Dive into Permission Handling Mechanism\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on storage and file movement code\n- **Critical Discoveries**:\n  - **FileSystemStorage._save() method** (lines 226-287 in storage.py):\n    - Line 254-255: Uses `file_move_safe()` when content has `temporary_file_path()` (TemporaryUploadedFile case)\n    - Line 258-274: Uses `os.open()` with 0o666 permissions for streaming content (InMemoryUploadedFile case)\n    - **Line 283-284: CRUCIAL - `os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)` is applied AFTER file operations**\n  \n  - **file_move_safe() function** (lines 30-87 in move.py):\n    - Line 48: First tries `os.rename()` which preserves original file permissions\n    - Line 58-59: Falls back to `os.open()` with default permissions if rename fails\n    - Line 71: Uses `copystat()` to copy metadata from source to destination\n    - **CRITICAL ISSUE**: `copystat()` copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary file\n\n### 6. Root Cause Analysis Complete\n- **The Bug**: When `TemporaryUploadedFile` is saved via `file_move_safe()`:\n  1. Temporary file is created with 0o600 permissions by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`/`tempfile.mkstemp`\n  2. `file_move_safe()` moves the file using `os.rename()` or manual copy\n  3. `copystat()` (line 71 in move.py) copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions to the destination\n  4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` then applies `os.chmod()` with `file_permissions_mode` (line 283-284)\n  5. **However, the `copystat()` call happens AFTER the file is moved but BEFORE the chmod in storage**\n\n- **The Fix Location**: The issue is in the interaction between `file_move_safe()` and `FileSystemStorage._save()`. The `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` overwrites any permissions that should be set by the storage layer.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Issues Identified\n1. **Permission Inconsistency**: `TemporaryUploadedFile` (disk-based) gets 0o600 permissions copied from temporary file, while `InMemoryUploadedFile` (memory-based) gets proper permissions from storage settings\n2. **Root Cause**: `copystat()` in `file_move_safe()` copies restrictive temporary file permissions, interfering with Django's permission management\n3. **Timing Issue**: Permission copying happens after file movement but before Django's intended permission setting\n\n### Technical Analysis Complete\n- Located exact bug location: `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` function (line 71)\n- Identified permission flow: temp file (0o600) → `file_move_safe()` → `copystat()` → `os.chmod()` in storage\n- Found that `InMemoryUploadedFile` path works correctly because it uses `os.open()` with 0o666 and proper chmod\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify `file_move_safe()` to not copy permissions when used in Django's file storage context, or modify `FileSystemStorage._save()` to handle this case\n2. **Create Reproduction Test**: Write a test that demonstrates the permission inconsistency between the two upload file types\n3. **Verify Fix**: Run existing permission tests and new reproduction test\n\n## Important Technical Context\n\n- **Settings**: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` controls final file permissions (default: None)\n- **Upload Threshold**: Django switches between memory and disk storage based on file size\n- **Platform Differences**: Windows has custom temporary file implementation using `tempfile.mkstemp()`\n- **Storage Integration**: Final permissions should be applied in `FileSystemStorage._save()` at line 283-284\n- **Bug Location**: `copystat()` call in `file_move_safe()` at line 71 interferes with Django's permission management\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the exact root cause and location of the permission inconsistency bug. The issue is in the `file_move_safe()` function's `copystat()` call that copies restrictive temporary file permissions, overriding Django's intended permission management system.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/conf/global_settings.py\nStart line: 307\nEnd line: 307\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nStart line: 283\nEnd line: 284\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\nStart line: 70\nEnd line: 77\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nStart line: 254\nEnd line: 255\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nStart line: 258\nEnd line: 274\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture. The problem is that when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is `None` (the default), uploaded files get inconsistent permissions:\n\n1. **MemoryUploadedFile** (small files): Get reasonable permissions (likely 0o644 or similar)\n2. **TemporaryUploadedFile** (large files): Get restrictive 0o600 permissions due to `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` + `os.rename`/`copystat` sequence\n\nThe solution is to set a default value of 0o644 for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` so that all uploaded files get consistent, reasonable permissions regardless of their storage method.\n\nLooking at the suspicious locations provided by the locator, I can see they've identified the key areas:\n1. The default setting location\n2. The permission application logic\n3. The file move logic that causes the inconsistency\n4. Both code paths (memory vs temporary file)\n\nS\n\n1. **django/conf/global_settings.py (line 307)**: Change `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` to `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644` to provide a consistent default that ensures all uploaded files get reasonable permissions regardless of whether they use memory or temporary file storage.\n\n2. **django/core/files/storage.py (lines 283-284)**: The permission application logic is correct - it applies `file_permissions_mode` when not None. This works properly when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` has a value, ensuring consistent permissions for both upload paths.\n\n3. **django/core/files/move.py (lines 70-77)**: The `copystat()` call copies restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary files, but this becomes irrelevant when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is set to 0o644 because the subsequent `os.chmod()` in storage.py will override these permissions with the intended value.\n\n4. **django/core/files/storage.py (lines 254-255)**: The `file_move_safe()` call for `TemporaryUploadedFile` will continue to work correctly because the permission inconsistency is resolved by having a default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` value that gets applied afterward.\n\n5. **django/core/files/storage.py (lines 258-274)**: The `InMemoryUploadedFile` code path already works correctly and will continue to work with the new default, ensuring both upload methods result in files with 0o644 permissions.\nNote that the Patch provided should be a direct substitution of the location code by the Locator.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine the `file_move_safe` function implementation to understand how it handles file permissions.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\", \"start_line\": 30, \"end_line\": 80 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\nTotal lines: 87\nShowing lines 30-79:\n\n  30: def file_move_safe(old_file_name, new_file_name, chunk_size=1024 * 64, allow_overwrite=False):\n  31:     \"\"\"\n  32:     Move a file from one location to another in the safest way possible.\n  33: \n  34:     First, try ``os.rename``, which is simple but will break across filesystems.\n  35:     If that fails, stream manually from one file to another in pure Python.\n  36: \n  37:     If the destination file exists and ``allow_overwrite`` is ``False``, raise\n  38:     ``FileExistsError``.\n  39:     \"\"\"\n  40:     # There's no reason to move if we don't have to.\n  41:     if _samefile(old_file_name, new_file_name):\n  42:         return\n  43: \n  44:     try:\n  45:         if not allow_overwrite and os.access(new_file_name, os.F_OK):\n  46:             raise FileExistsError('Destination file %s exists and allow_overwrite is False.' % new_file_name)\n  47: \n  48:         os.rename(old_file_name, new_file_name)\n  49:         return\n  50:     except OSError:\n  51:         # OSError happens with os.rename() if moving to another filesystem or\n  52:         # when moving opened files on certain operating systems.\n  53:         pass\n  54: \n  55:     # first open the old file, so that it won't go away\n  56:     with open(old_file_name, 'rb') as old_file:\n  57:         # now open the new file, not forgetting allow_overwrite\n  58:         fd = os.open(new_file_name, (os.O_WRONLY | os.O_CREAT | getattr(os, 'O_BINARY', 0) |\n  59:                                      (os.O_EXCL if not allow_overwrite else 0)))\n  60:         try:\n  61:             locks.lock(fd, locks.LOCK_EX)\n  62:             current_chunk = None\n  63:             while current_chunk != b'':\n  64:                 current_chunk = old_file.read(chunk_size)\n  65:                 os.write(fd, current_chunk)\n  66:         finally:\n  67:             locks.unlock(fd)\n  68:             os.close(fd)\n  69: \n  70:     try:\n  71:         copystat(old_file_name, new_file_name)\n  72:     except PermissionError as e:\n  73:         # Certain filesystems (e.g. CIFS) fail to copy the file's metadata if\n  74:         # the type of the destination filesystem isn't the same as the source\n  75:         # filesystem; ignore that.\n  76:         if e.errno != errno.EPERM:\n  77:             raise\n  78: \n  79:     try:\n\nNow let me examine the rest of the `file_move_safe` function to see how it handles file cleanup.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\", \"start_line\": 79, \"end_line\": 87 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\nTotal lines: 87\nShowing lines 79-87:\n\n  79:     try:\n  80:         os.remove(old_file_name)\n  81:     except PermissionError as e:\n  82:         # Certain operating systems (Cygwin and Windows)\n  83:         # fail when deleting opened files, ignore it.

When `TemporaryUploadedFile` is used, the final file gets restrictive 0o600 permissions instead of the intended permissions.\n\n**Root Cause**: In `file_move_safe()` function at line 71, `copystat(old_file_name, new_file_name)` copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from the temporary file to the destination file. This happens after the file is moved but before Django's storage layer can apply the correct permissions via `os.chmod()` in `FileSystemStorage._save()`.\n\n**The Flow**:\n1. `TemporaryUploadedFile` creates temp file with 0o600 permissions (security default)\n2. `FileSystemStorage._save()` calls `file_move_safe()` to move the temp file\n3. `file_move_safe()` moves the file and then calls `copystat()` which copies the 0o600 permissions\n4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` then tries to apply correct permissions with `os.chmod()`, but the damage is done\n\n**The Fix**: The issue is that `copystat()` should not copy file permissions when Django's storage system is managing permissions. The fix should be in the `file_move_safe()` function to avoid copying permissions, or modify how it's called from the storage layer.\n\nLet me examine the exact location where `file_move_safe()` is called from `FileSystemStorage._save()` to understand the context better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\", \"start_line\": 250, \"end_line\": 290 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\nTotal lines: 360\nShowing lines 250-290:\n\n 250: \n 251:         while True:\n 252:             try:\n 253:                 # This file has a file path that we can move.\n 254:                 if hasattr(content, 'temporary_file_path'):\n 255:                     file_move_safe(content.temporary_file_path(), full_path)\n 256: \n 257:                 # This is a normal uploadedfile that we can stream.\n 258:                 else:\n 259:                     # The current umask value is masked out by os.open!\n 260:                     fd = os.open(full_path, self.OS_OPEN_FLAGS, 0o666)\n 261:                     _file = None\n 262:                     try:\n 263:                         locks.lock(fd, locks.LOCK_EX)\n 264:                         for chunk in content.chunks():\n 265:                             if _file is None:\n 266:                                 mode = 'wb' if isinstance(chunk, bytes) else 'wt'\n 267:                                 _file = os.fdopen(fd, mode)\n 268:                             _file.write(chunk)\n 269:                     finally:\n 270:                         locks.unlock(fd)\n 271:                         if _file is not None:\n 272:                             _file.close()\n 273:                         else:\n 274:                             os.close(fd)\n 275:             except FileExistsError:\n 276:                 # A new name is needed if the file exists.\n 277:                 name = self.get_available_name(name)\n 278:                 full_path = self.path(name)\n 279:             else:\n 280:                 # OK, the file save worked.

The issue is that `TemporaryUploadedFile` results in files with 0o600 permissions while `InMemoryUploadedFile` gets proper permissions, creating inconsistent behavior.\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**Root Cause**: The `file_move_safe()` function calls `copystat()` which copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary files to the final destination, overriding Django's intended permission management.\n\n**Flow**:\n1. `TemporaryUploadedFile` creates temp file with 0o600 permissions (security default)\n2. `FileSystemStorage._save()` calls `file_move_safe()` to move temp file (line 255)\n3. `file_move_safe()` copies file and then calls `copystat()` (line 71) which copies 0o600 permissions\n4. `FileSystemStorage._save()` applies correct permissions with `os.chmod()` (line 284), but this happens after `copystat()` has already set restrictive permissions\n\n## Bug Locations\n\n**Location 1: django/core/files/move.py, lines 70-77**\nThe `copystat()` call that copies restrictive temporary file permissions to the destination file, interfering with Django's permission management system.\n\n**Location 2: django/core/files/storage.py, lines 254-255** \nThe call to `file_move_safe()` for `TemporaryUploadedFile` that triggers the permission copying issue.\n\n**Location 3: django/core/files/storage.py, lines 283-284**\nThe intended permission setting that gets overridden by the earlier `copystat()` call.\n\n**Location 4: django/conf/global_settings.py, line 307**\nThe default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` setting that should be changed to 0o644 as requested.\n\n**Location 5: django/core/files/storage.py, lines 258-274**\nThe `InMemoryUploadedFile` code path that works correctly, showing the intended behavior for comparison.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the actual problem statement. The issue is not just about fixing a bug, but specifically about setting the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to 0o644 to address the inconsistent permissions between `MemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile`.\n\nThe problem is:\n1. When `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is `None` (default), file permissions are inconsistent\n2. `MemoryUploadedFile` results in one set of permissions\n3. `TemporaryUploadedFile` results in 0o600 permissions due to temporary file creation + `os.rename`/`copystat`\n4. The solution is to set a default value of 0o644 for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`\n\nThe key locations to fix this are:\n1. The default setting in `global_settings.py`\n2. The permission handling logic in `FileSystemStorage._save()`\n3. The `file_move_safe()` function that causes the inconsistency\n4. Any related permission handling code\n\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/conf/global_settings.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 307,\n            \"end_line\": 307\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 283,\n            \"end_line\": 284\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 70,\n            \"end_line\": 77\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 254,\n            \"end_line\": 255\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 258,\n            \"end_line\": 274\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture.

This works properly when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` has a value, ensuring consistent permissions for both upload paths.\n\n3. **django/core/files/move.py (lines 70-77)**: The `copystat()` call copies restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary files, but this becomes irrelevant when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is set to 0o644 because the subsequent `os.chmod()` in storage.py will override these permissions with the intended value.\n\n4. **django/core/files/storage.py (lines 254-255)**: The `file_move_safe()` call for `TemporaryUploadedFile` will continue to work correctly because the permission inconsistency is resolved by having a default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` value that gets applied afterward.\n\n5. **django/core/files/storage.py (lines 258-274)**: The `InMemoryUploadedFile` code path already works correctly and will continue to work with the new default, ensuring both upload methods result in files with 0o644 permissions.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/conf/global_settings.py lines 307-307\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py lines 283-284\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        if self.file_permissions_mode is not None:\n            os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py lines 70-77\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    try:\n        copystat(old_file_name, new_file_name)\n    except PermissionError as e:\n        # Certain filesystems (e.g. CIFS) fail to copy the file's metadata if\n        # the type of the destination filesystem isn't the same as the source\n        # filesystem; ignore that.\n        if e.errno != errno.EPERM:\n            raise\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py lines 254-255\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                if hasattr(content, 'temporary_file_path'):\n                    file_move_safe(content.temporary_file_path(), full_path)\n\n\n[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py lines 258-274\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                else:\n                    # The current umask value is masked out by os.open!\n                    fd = os.open(full_path, self.OS_OPEN_FLAGS, 0o666)\n                    _file = None\n                    try:\n                        locks.lock(fd, locks.LOCK_EX)\n                        for chunk in content.chunks():\n                            if _file is None:\n                                mode = 'wb' if isinstance(chunk, bytes) else 'wt'\n                                _file = os.fdopen(fd, mode)\n                            _file.write(chunk)\n                    finally:\n                        locks.unlock(fd)\n                        if _file is not None:\n                            _file.close()\n                        else:\n                            os.close(fd)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nLooking at the provided code segments and the problem statement, I can see that these locations are indeed the right places to address the file upload permissions inconsistency issue.\n\n**Analysis of the locations:**\n\n1. **Location 1** (`global_settings.py` line 307): This is where `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None` is set as the default. This is the primary location that needs to be changed to `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644` to solve the inconsistency problem.\n\n2. **Location 2** (`storage.py` lines 283-284): This shows the permission application logic that works correctly when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` has a value. Once we set the default to 0o644, this code will ensure consistent permissions are applied.\n\n3. **Location 3** (`move.py` lines 70-77): This shows the `copystat()` call that copies the restrictive 0o600 permissions from temporary files. While this is part of the problem, it becomes irrelevant once we have a default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` value because the subsequent `os.chmod()` will override these permissions.\n\n4. **Location 4** (`storage.py` lines 254-255): This shows where `file_move_safe()` is called for `TemporaryUploadedFile`, which triggers the permission copying issue. With the default permission set, this path will work consistently.\n\n5. **Location 5** (`storage.py` lines 258-274): This shows the `InMemoryUploadedFile` code path that already works correctly and will continue to work with the new default.\n\nThe problem statement is clear: \"Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644\" to address the inconsistency between `MemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile` permissions. The primary fix is simply changing the default value in `global_settings.py`, and the other locations show the supporting infrastructure that will work correctly once this change is made.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/conf/global_settings.py lines 307-307\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  297: # SuspiciousOperation (TooManyFieldsSent) is raised.\n[C]  298: DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_NUMBER_FIELDS = 1000\n[C]  299: \n[C]  300: # Directory in which upload streamed files will be temporarily saved.

The problem is that when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is `None` (the default), uploaded files get inconsistent permissions:\n\n1. **MemoryUploadedFile** (small files): Get reasonable permissions (likely 0o644 or similar)\n2. **TemporaryUploadedFile** (large files): Get restrictive 0o600 permissions due to `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` + `os.rename`/`copystat` sequence\n\nThe solution is to set a default value of 0o644 for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` so that all uploaded files get consistent, reasonable permissions regardless of their storage method.\n\nLooking at the suspicious locations provided by the locator, I can see they've identified the key areas:\n1. The default setting location\n2. The permission application logic\n3. The file move logic that causes the inconsistency\n4.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/conf/global_settings.py lines 307-307\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py lines 283-284\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        if self.file_permissions_mode is not None:\n            os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/move.py lines 70-77\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    try:\n        copystat(old_file_name, new_file_name)\n    except PermissionError as e:\n        # Certain filesystems (e.g. CIFS) fail to copy the file's metadata if\n        # the type of the destination filesystem isn't the same as the source\n        # filesystem; ignore that.\n        if e.errno != errno.EPERM:\n            raise\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py lines 254-255\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                if hasattr(content, 'temporary_file_path'):\n                    file_move_safe(content.temporary_file_path(), full_path)\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/core/files/storage.py lines 258-274\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                else:\n                    # The current umask value is masked out by os.open!\n                    fd = os.open(full_path, self.OS_OPEN_FLAGS, 0o666)\n                    _file = None\n                    try:\n                        locks.lock(fd, locks.LOCK_EX)\n                        for chunk in content.chunks():\n                            if _file is None:\n                                mode = 'wb' if isinstance(chunk, bytes) else 'wt'\n                                _file = os.fdopen(fd, mode)\n                            _file.write(chunk)\n                    finally:\n                        locks.unlock(fd)\n                        if _file is not None:\n                            _file.close()\n                        else:\n                            os.close(fd)\n\n\n\n**Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n",
