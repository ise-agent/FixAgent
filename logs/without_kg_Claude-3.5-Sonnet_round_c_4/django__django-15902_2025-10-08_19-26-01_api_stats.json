ManagementForm Structure (`/django/forms/formsets.py:28-50`)\n- Inherits from `Form` class\n- Contains only hidden input fields: `TOTAL_FORMS`, `INITIAL_FORMS`, `MIN_NUM_FORMS`, `MAX_NUM_FORMS`\n- Purpose: Track form instances in formsets via hidden inputs only\n\n#### 2.

Inheritance Chain Discovered\n```\nManagementForm → Form → BaseForm → RenderableFormMixin → RenderableMixin\n```\n- The warning is triggered in `RenderableMixin.render()` method\n- All forms inherit this behavior, including ManagementForm\n\n#### 4.

Implement a solution to bypass the deprecation warning for ManagementForm\n2. Possible approaches:\n   - Override the `render()` method in ManagementForm to skip the warning\n   - Add logic to detect hidden-only forms and skip the warning\n   - Create a specialized renderer for ManagementForm\n3.

ManagementForm Structure (`/django/forms/formsets.py:28-50`)\n- Inherits from `Form` class\n- Contains only hidden input fields: `TOTAL_FORMS`, `INITIAL_FORMS`, `MIN_NUM_FORMS`, `MAX_NUM_FORMS`\n- Purpose: Track form instances in formsets via hidden inputs only\n\n#### 2. Deprecation Warning Location (`/django/forms/utils.py:64-75`)\n```python\ndef render(self, template_name=None, context=None, renderer=None):\n    # ... setup code ...\n    if (\n        template == \"django/forms/default.html\"\n        or template == \"django/forms/formsets/default.html\"\n    ):\n        warnings.warn(\n            DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_DEPRECATION_MSG, RemovedInDjango50Warning, stacklevel=2\n        )\n    return mark_safe(renderer.render(template, context))\n```\n\n#### 3. Inheritance Chain Discovered\n```\nManagementForm → Form → BaseForm → RenderableFormMixin → RenderableMixin\n```\n- The warning is triggered in `RenderableMixin.render()` method\n- All forms inherit this behavior, including ManagementForm\n\n#### 4. Template Configuration (`/django/forms/renderers.py:21-22`)\n```python\nform_template_name = \"django/forms/default.html\"\nformset_template_name = \"django/forms/formsets/default.html\"\n```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Root cause analysis and code location identification\n- ✅ **Completed**: Understanding of inheritance chain and warning trigger mechanism\n- ⏳ **In Progress**: Need to implement fix for ManagementForm to avoid unnecessary warnings\n- ❌ **Pending**: Testing and validation of the fix\n\n## Proposed Solution Strategy\nThe fix should prevent ManagementForm from triggering the deprecation warning since:\n1. ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs\n2. Template choice is irrelevant for hidden-only forms\n3. Users have no control over ManagementForm rendering in formsets\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. Implement a solution to bypass the deprecation warning for ManagementForm\n2. Possible approaches:\n   - Override the `render()` method in ManagementForm to skip the warning\n   - Add logic to detect hidden-only forms and skip the warning\n   - Create a specialized renderer for ManagementForm\n3. Test the fix with formset usage scenarios\n4.

ManagementForm Structure (`/django/forms/formsets.py:28-50`)\n- Inherits from `Form` class\n- Contains only hidden input fields: `TOTAL_FORMS`, `INITIAL_FORMS`, `MIN_NUM_FORMS`, `MAX_NUM_FORMS`\n- Purpose: Track form instances in formsets via hidden inputs only\n\n#### 2. Deprecation Warning Location (`/django/forms/utils.py:64-75`)\n```python\ndef render(self, template_name=None, context=None, renderer=None):\n    # ... setup code ...\n    if (\n        template == \"django/forms/default.html\"\n        or template == \"django/forms/formsets/default.html\"\n    ):\n        warnings.warn(\n            DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_DEPRECATION_MSG, RemovedInDjango50Warning, stacklevel=2\n        )\n    return mark_safe(renderer.render(template, context))\n```\n\n#### 3. Inheritance Chain Discovered\n```\nManagementForm → Form → BaseForm → RenderableFormMixin → RenderableMixin\n```\n- The warning is triggered in `RenderableMixin.render()` method\n- All forms inherit this behavior, including ManagementForm\n\n#### 4. Template Configuration (`/django/forms/renderers.py:21-22`)\n```python\nform_template_name = \"django/forms/default.html\"\nformset_template_name = \"django/forms/formsets/default.html\"\n```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n- ✅ **Completed**: Root cause analysis and code location identification\n- ✅ **Completed**: Understanding of inheritance chain and warning trigger mechanism\n- ⏳ **In Progress**: Need to implement fix for ManagementForm to avoid unnecessary warnings\n- ❌ **Pending**: Testing and validation of the fix\n\n## Proposed Solution Strategy\nThe fix should prevent ManagementForm from triggering the deprecation warning since:\n1. ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs\n2. Template choice is irrelevant for hidden-only forms\n3. Users have no control over ManagementForm rendering in formsets\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. Implement a solution to bypass the deprecation warning for ManagementForm\n2. Possible approaches:\n   - Override the `render()` method in ManagementForm to skip the warning\n   - Add logic to detect hidden-only forms and skip the warning\n   - Create a specialized renderer for ManagementForm\n3. Test the fix with formset usage scenarios\n4. Ensure the fix doesn't affect other form types that should show the warning\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Mapped Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Analyzed source code in formsets.py, utils.py, forms.py, renderers.py\n- `search_code_with_context`: Located deprecation warning implementation and related code\n\n## Critical Files Identified\n- `/django/forms/formsets.py` - ManagementForm definition\n- `/django/forms/utils.py` - Deprecation warning implementation\n- `/django/forms/forms.py` - Form base classes\n- `/django/forms/renderers.py` - Template configuration\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py\nStart line: 64\nEnd line: 75\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py\nStart line: 28\nEnd line: 50\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py\nStart line: 56\nEnd line: 57\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py\nStart line: 81\nEnd line: 85\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py\nStart line: 537\nEnd line: 538\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture.

Users have no control over this rendering\n\nLet me check the Form class definition to see how it's structured and then look at the ManagementForm more closely to understand exactly what it renders.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py\", \"start_line\": 530, \"end_line\": 543 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py\nTotal lines: 543\nShowing lines 530-543:\n\n 530:             isinstance(value, (datetime.datetime, datetime.time))\n 531:             and not field.widget.supports_microseconds\n 532:         ):\n 533:             value = value.replace(microsecond=0)\n 534:         return value\n 535: \n 536: \n 537: class Form(BaseForm, metaclass=DeclarativeFieldsMetaclass):\n 538:     \"A collection of Fields, plus their associated data.\"\n 539:     # This is a separate class from BaseForm in order to abstract the way\n 540:     # self.fields is specified.

The problem is that ManagementForm triggers the \"default.html\" deprecation warning even though:\n\n1. Users never explicitly render ManagementForm with `{{ form }}`\n2. ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs where template choice is irrelevant\n3. The warning is triggered automatically during formset rendering, not by user code\n\nThe locations identified by the locator are all interconnected in the inheritance chain that causes this issue. Let me analyze how they work together and propose coordinated fixes.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py:64-75]**: Modify the deprecation warning logic in `RenderableMixin.render()` to check if the form is a ManagementForm before showing the warning. Add a condition like `if not isinstance(self, ManagementForm)` before the warning block. This prevents ManagementForm from triggering unnecessary warnings while preserving the warning for other forms.\n\n2. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py:28-50]**: Override the `render()` method in ManagementForm to bypass the deprecation warning entirely. Since ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs, it can skip the template deprecation check and directly call the renderer without triggering the warning logic from its parent classes.\n\n3. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py:56-57]**: The BaseForm class inheritance from RenderableFormMixin is correct and should remain unchanged. This location establishes the necessary inheritance chain but doesn't need modification - the fix should be implemented at the warning trigger point or in ManagementForm specifically.\n\n4. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py:81-85]**: The RenderableFormMixin class definition should remain unchanged as it provides essential functionality to all forms. The issue is not with this mixin itself but with how the deprecation warning applies to special cases like ManagementForm.\n\n5. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py:537-538]**: The Form class definition should remain unchanged as it correctly inherits from BaseForm. This location is part of the inheritance chain but doesn't need modification - the fix should target either the warning logic or ManagementForm's behavior specifically.\n\n**Recommended approach**: Implement suggestion #2 (override render() in ManagementForm) as it's the most targeted fix that addresses the root cause without affecting other forms or requiring complex conditional logic in the core warning system.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py lines 64-75\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def render(self, template_name=None, context=None, renderer=None):\n        renderer = renderer or self.renderer\n        template = template_name or self.template_name\n        context = context or self.get_context()\n        if (\n            template == \"django/forms/default.html\"\n            or template == \"django/forms/formsets/default.html\"\n        ):\n            warnings.warn(\n                DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_DEPRECATION_MSG, RemovedInDjango50Warning, stacklevel=2\n            )\n        return mark_safe(renderer.render(template, context))\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py lines 28-50\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nclass ManagementForm(Form):\n    \"\"\"\n    Keep track of how many form instances are displayed on the page.

ManagementForm Structure (`/django/forms/formsets.py:28-50`)\n- Inherits from `Form` class\n- Contains only hidden input fields: `TOTAL_FORMS`, `INITIAL_FORMS`, `MIN_NUM_FORMS`, `MAX_NUM_FORMS`\n- Purpose: Track form instances in formsets via hidden inputs only\n\n#### 2.

ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs\n2. Template choice is irrelevant for hidden-only forms\n3. Users have no control over ManagementForm rendering in formsets\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. Implement a solution to bypass the deprecation warning for ManagementForm\n2. Possible approaches:\n   - Override the `render()` method in ManagementForm to skip the warning\n   - Add logic to detect hidden-only forms and skip the warning\n   - Create a specialized renderer for ManagementForm\n3. Test the fix with formset usage scenarios\n4.

Users have no control over this rendering\n\nLet me check the Form class definition to see how it's structured and then look at the ManagementForm more closely to understand exactly what it renders.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py\", \"start_line\": 530, \"end_line\": 543 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py\nTotal lines: 543\nShowing lines 530-543:\n\n 530:             isinstance(value, (datetime.datetime, datetime.time))\n 531:             and not field.widget.supports_microseconds\n 532:         ):\n 533:             value = value.replace(microsecond=0)\n 534:         return value\n 535: \n 536: \n 537: class Form(BaseForm, metaclass=DeclarativeFieldsMetaclass):\n 538:     \"A collection of Fields, plus their associated data.\"\n 539:     # This is a separate class from BaseForm in order to abstract the way\n 540:     # self.fields is specified.

Let me analyze the collected context:\n\n1. **What the code does**: \n   - `ManagementForm` inherits from `Form` → `BaseForm` → `RenderableFormMixin` → `RenderableMixin`\n   - When any form is rendered, `RenderableMixin.render()` checks if the template is \"django/forms/default.html\" and shows a deprecation warning\n   - ManagementForm only contains hidden fields for formset management (TOTAL_FORMS, INITIAL_FORMS, etc.)\n\n2. **How this influences the failing behavior**:\n   - Even though ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs, it still triggers the deprecation warning\n   - Users get warnings even when they never use `{{ form }}` expressions because formset management forms are automatically rendered\n   - The template choice is irrelevant for ManagementForm since it only outputs hidden inputs\n\n3. **Relationship to the bug**:\n   - The bug is that ManagementForm unnecessarily triggers deprecation warnings\n   - The warning should only apply to forms that actually render visible content using templates\n   - ManagementForm is a special case that should be exempt from this warning\n\nNow I need to identify the exact locations where the fix should be implemented. Let me look at the ManagementForm's render behavior and see if it has any special rendering logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"def render\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'def render' in file '/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py'\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nBased on my analysis, I now have enough information to identify the bug locations. The issue is clear:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: ManagementForm inherits from Form, which inherits the deprecation warning behavior from RenderableMixin\n2. **Problem**: The warning is triggered even for ManagementForm, which only produces hidden inputs where template choice is irrelevant\n3. **Impact**: Users get unnecessary deprecation warnings even when they never use `{{ form }}` expressions\n\nThe bug manifests in the inheritance chain and the deprecation warning logic. I can identify the specific locations that need to be addressed:\n\n**Location 1**: The deprecation warning logic in RenderableMixin.render() method\n**Location 2**: ManagementForm class definition that inherits the problematic behavior\n**Location 3**: Potentially the template_name property that triggers the warning\n\nLet me identify the exact line ranges for these locations.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py\", \"start_line\": 60, \"end_line\": 80 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py\nTotal lines: 243\nShowing lines 60-80:\n\n  60:         raise NotImplementedError(\n  61:             \"Subclasses of RenderableMixin must provide a get_context() method.\"\n  62:         )\n  63: \n  64:     def render(self, template_name=None, context=None, renderer=None):\n  65:         renderer = renderer or self.renderer\n  66:         template = template_name or self.template_name\n  67:         context = context or self.get_context()\n  68:         if (\n  69:             template == \"django/forms/default.html\"\n  70:             or template == \"django/forms/formsets/default.html\"\n  71:         ):\n  72:             warnings.warn(\n  73:                 DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_DEPRECATION_MSG, RemovedInDjango50Warning, stacklevel=2\n  74:             )\n  75:         return mark_safe(renderer.render(template, context))\n  76: \n  77:     __str__ = render\n  78:     __html__ = render\n  79: \n  80: \n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nBased on my comprehensive analysis, I now have enough information to identify the precise locations where the bug manifests and needs to be fixed. Let me summarize what I've discovered:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Root Cause**: ManagementForm inherits from Form → BaseForm → RenderableFormMixin → RenderableMixin, which contains deprecation warning logic\n2. **Problem**: The warning is triggered in `RenderableMixin.render()` even for ManagementForm, which only produces hidden inputs\n3. **Impact**: Users get unnecessary warnings even when they never use `{{ form }}` expressions because formset management forms are automatically rendered\n\n**Key Locations Identified:**\n\n1. **Primary Location - Deprecation Warning Logic**: `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py`, lines 64-75\n   - This is where the deprecation warning is triggered for all forms using default templates\n   - The logic checks if template is \"django/forms/default.html\" or \"django/forms/formsets/default.html\" and shows warning\n\n2. **Secondary Location - ManagementForm Definition**: `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py`, lines 28-50\n   - ManagementForm inherits from Form, which brings in the deprecation warning behavior\n   - This form only contains hidden fields but still triggers the warning\n\n3. **Related Location - Form Inheritance Chain**: `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py`, lines 56-57 and 537-538\n   - BaseForm inherits from RenderableFormMixin (line 56)\n   - Form inherits from BaseForm (line 537)\n   - This establishes the inheritance chain that brings the warning behavior to ManagementForm\n\nThe fix should prevent ManagementForm from triggering the deprecation warning since template choice is irrelevant for hidden-only forms.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations:\n\n1. **Lines 68-74** in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py` - The deprecation warning logic in `RenderableMixin.render()` method that triggers warnings for all forms using default templates\n\n2. **Lines 28-50** in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py` - ManagementForm class definition that inherits the problematic deprecation warning behavior from Form\n\n3. **Lines 56-57** in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py` - BaseForm class definition that inherits from RenderableFormMixin, establishing the inheritance chain\n\n4. **Lines 537-538** in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py` - Form class definition that inherits from BaseForm, completing the inheritance chain to ManagementForm\n\n5. **Lines 81-85** in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py` - RenderableFormMixin class definition that inherits from RenderableMixin, bringing the deprecation warning behavior to all forms\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis, I've identified the root cause of the bug: ManagementForm inherits deprecation warning behavior from RenderableMixin, but since it only produces hidden inputs, the template choice is irrelevant and the warning is unnecessary.\n\nHere are the suspicious locations where the bug manifests:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 64,\n            \"end_line\": 75\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 28,\n            \"end_line\": 50\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 56,\n            \"end_line\": 57\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 81,\n            \"end_line\": 85\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 537,\n            \"end_line\": 538\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I have the complete picture. The problem is that ManagementForm triggers the \"default.html\" deprecation warning even though:\n\n1. Users never explicitly render ManagementForm with `{{ form }}`\n2. ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs where template choice is irrelevant\n3. The warning is triggered automatically during formset rendering, not by user code\n\nThe locations identified by the locator are all interconnected in the inheritance chain that causes this issue. Let me analyze how they work together and propose coordinated fixes.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py:64-75]**: Modify the deprecation warning logic in `RenderableMixin.render()` to check if the form is a ManagementForm before showing the warning. Add a condition like `if not isinstance(self, ManagementForm)` before the warning block. This prevents ManagementForm from triggering unnecessary warnings while preserving the warning for other forms.\n\n2. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py:28-50]**: Override the `render()` method in ManagementForm to bypass the deprecation warning entirely. Since ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs, it can skip the template deprecation check and directly call the renderer without triggering the warning logic from its parent classes.\n\n3. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py:56-57]**: The BaseForm class inheritance from RenderableFormMixin is correct and should remain unchanged. This location establishes the necessary inheritance chain but doesn't need modification - the fix should be implemented at the warning trigger point or in ManagementForm specifically.\n\n4. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py:81-85]**: The RenderableFormMixin class definition should remain unchanged as it provides essential functionality to all forms. The issue is not with this mixin itself but with how the deprecation warning applies to special cases like ManagementForm.\n\n5. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py:537-538]**: The Form class definition should remain unchanged as it correctly inherits from BaseForm. This location is part of the inheritance chain but doesn't need modification - the fix should target either the warning logic or ManagementForm's behavior specifically.\n\n**Recommended approach**: Implement suggestion #2 (override render() in ManagementForm) as it's the most targeted fix that addresses the root cause without affecting other forms or requiring complex conditional logic in the core warning system.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py lines 64-75\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def render(self, template_name=None, context=None, renderer=None):\n        renderer = renderer or self.renderer\n        template = template_name or self.template_name\n        context = context or self.get_context()\n        if (\n            template == \"django/forms/default.html\"\n            or template == \"django/forms/formsets/default.html\"\n        ):\n            warnings.warn(\n                DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_DEPRECATION_MSG, RemovedInDjango50Warning, stacklevel=2\n            )\n        return mark_safe(renderer.render(template, context))\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py lines 28-50\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nclass ManagementForm(Form):\n    \"\"\"\n    Keep track of how many form instances are displayed on the page.

Based on my analysis, the most appropriate solution is to override the `render()` method in `ManagementForm` (Location 2) to bypass the deprecation warning logic from Location 1. \n\nHere's why this approach is optimal:\n\n1. **Targeted Fix**: ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs, so template choice is irrelevant - it should be exempt from the deprecation warning\n2. **Minimal Impact**: This doesn't affect other forms that legitimately should show the warning\n3. **Framework Compliance**: Maintains the existing inheritance chain while addressing the specific issue\n4. **User Experience**: Eliminates unnecessary warnings for users who never use `{{ form }}` expressions but still get warnings from automatic formset management form rendering\n\nThe fix will involve adding a custom `render()` method to `ManagementForm` that skips the deprecation warning check and directly renders the form, since the template choice is meaningless for hidden-only forms.\nUser: [Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py lines 64-75\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import json\n  import warnings\n  from collections import UserList\n  from django.conf import settings\n  from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError\n  from django.forms.renderers import get_default_renderer\n  from django.utils import timezone\n  from django.utils.deprecation import RemovedInDjango50Warning\n  from django.utils.html import escape, format_html_join\n  from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\n  from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n  from django.utils.version import get_docs_version\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   54:     % get_docs_version()\n[C]   55: )\n[C]   56: \n[C]   57: \n[C]   58: class RenderableMixin:\n[C]   59:     def get_context(self):\n[C]   60:         raise NotImplementedError(\n[C]   61:             \"Subclasses of RenderableMixin must provide a get_context() method.\"\n[C]   62:         )\n[C]   63: \n[R]   64:     def render(self, template_name=None, context=None, renderer=None):\n[R]   65:         renderer = renderer or self.renderer\n[R]   66:         template = template_name or self.template_name\n[R]   67:         context = context or self.get_context()\n[R]   68:         if (\n[R]   69:             template == \"django/forms/default.html\"\n[R]   70:             or template == \"django/forms/formsets/default.html\"\n[R]   71:         ):\n[R]   72:             warnings.warn(\n[R]   73:                 DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_DEPRECATION_MSG, RemovedInDjango50Warning, stacklevel=2\n[R]   74:             )\n[R]   75:         return mark_safe(renderer.render(template, context))\n[C]   76: \n[C]   77:     __str__ = render\n[C]   78:     __html__ = render\n[C]   79: \n[C]   80: \n[C]   81: class RenderableFormMixin(RenderableMixin):\n[C]   82:     def as_p(self):\n[C]   83:         \"\"\"Render as <p> elements.\"\"\"\n[C]   84:         return self.render(self.template_name_p)\n[C]   85: \n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py lines 28-50\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError\n  from django.forms import Form\n  from django.forms.fields import BooleanField, IntegerField\n  from django.forms.renderers import get_default_renderer\n  from django.forms.utils import ErrorList, RenderableFormMixin\n  from django.forms.widgets import CheckboxInput, HiddenInput, NumberInput\n  from django.utils.functional import cached_property\n  from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n  from django.utils.translation import ngettext_lazy\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   18: ORDERING_FIELD_NAME = \"ORDER\"\n[C]   19: DELETION_FIELD_NAME = \"DELETE\"\n[C]   20: \n[C]   21: # default minimum number of forms in a formset\n[C]   22: DEFAULT_MIN_NUM = 0\n[C]   23: \n[C]   24: # default maximum number of forms in a formset, to prevent memory exhaustion\n[C]   25: DEFAULT_MAX_NUM = 1000\n[C]   26: \n[C]   27: \n[R]   28: class ManagementForm(Form):\n[R]   29:     \"\"\"\n[R]   30:     Keep track of how many form instances are displayed on the page.

Let me analyze how they work together and propose coordinated fixes.\n\nS\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py:64-75]**: Modify the deprecation warning logic in `RenderableMixin.render()` to check if the form is a ManagementForm before showing the warning. Add a condition like `if not isinstance(self, ManagementForm)` before the warning block. This prevents ManagementForm from triggering unnecessary warnings while preserving the warning for other forms.\n\n2. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py:28-50]**: Override the `render()` method in ManagementForm to bypass the deprecation warning entirely. Since ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs, it can skip the template deprecation check and directly call the renderer without triggering the warning logic from its parent classes.\n\n3. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py:56-57]**: The BaseForm class inheritance from RenderableFormMixin is correct and should remain unchanged. This location establishes the necessary inheritance chain but doesn't need modification - the fix should be implemented at the warning trigger point or in ManagementForm specifically.\n\n4. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py:81-85]**: The RenderableFormMixin class definition should remain unchanged as it provides essential functionality to all forms. The issue is not with this mixin itself but with how the deprecation warning applies to special cases like ManagementForm.\n\n5. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py:537-538]**: The Form class definition should remain unchanged as it correctly inherits from BaseForm. This location is part of the inheritance chain but doesn't need modification - the fix should target either the warning logic or ManagementForm's behavior specifically.\n\n**Recommended approach**: Implement suggestion #2 (override render() in ManagementForm) as it's the most targeted fix that addresses the root cause without affecting other forms or requiring complex conditional logic in the core warning system.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

Let me analyze how they work together and propose coordinated fixes.\n\nS\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py:64-75]**: Modify the deprecation warning logic in `RenderableMixin.render()` to check if the form is a ManagementForm before showing the warning. Add a condition like `if not isinstance(self, ManagementForm)` before the warning block. This prevents ManagementForm from triggering unnecessary warnings while preserving the warning for other forms.\n\n2. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py:28-50]**: Override the `render()` method in ManagementForm to bypass the deprecation warning entirely. Since ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs, it can skip the template deprecation check and directly call the renderer without triggering the warning logic from its parent classes.\n\n3. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py:56-57]**: The BaseForm class inheritance from RenderableFormMixin is correct and should remain unchanged. This location establishes the necessary inheritance chain but doesn't need modification - the fix should be implemented at the warning trigger point or in ManagementForm specifically.\n\n4. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py:81-85]**: The RenderableFormMixin class definition should remain unchanged as it provides essential functionality to all forms. The issue is not with this mixin itself but with how the deprecation warning applies to special cases like ManagementForm.\n\n5. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py:537-538]**: The Form class definition should remain unchanged as it correctly inherits from BaseForm.

The problem is that ManagementForm triggers the \"default.html\" deprecation warning even though:\n\n1. Users never explicitly render ManagementForm with `{{ form }}`\n2. ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs where template choice is irrelevant\n3. The warning is triggered automatically during formset rendering, not by user code\n\nThe locations identified by the locator are all interconnected in the inheritance chain that causes this issue. Let me analyze how they work together and propose coordinated fixes.\n\nS\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py:64-75]**: Modify the deprecation warning logic in `RenderableMixin.render()` to check if the form is a ManagementForm before showing the warning. Add a condition like `if not isinstance(self, ManagementForm)` before the warning block. This prevents ManagementForm from triggering unnecessary warnings while preserving the warning for other forms.\n\n2. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/formsets.py:28-50]**: Override the `render()` method in ManagementForm to bypass the deprecation warning entirely. Since ManagementForm only produces hidden inputs, it can skip the template deprecation check and directly call the renderer without triggering the warning logic from its parent classes.\n\n3. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py:56-57]**: The BaseForm class inheritance from RenderableFormMixin is correct and should remain unchanged. This location establishes the necessary inheritance chain but doesn't need modification - the fix should be implemented at the warning trigger point or in ManagementForm specifically.\n\n4. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/utils.py:81-85]**: The RenderableFormMixin class definition should remain unchanged as it provides essential functionality to all forms. The issue is not with this mixin itself but with how the deprecation warning applies to special cases like ManagementForm.\n\n5. **[/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/forms/forms.py:537-538]**: The Form class definition should remain unchanged as it correctly inherits from BaseForm. This location is part of the inheritance chain but doesn't need modification - the fix should target either the warning logic or ManagementForm's behavior specifically.\n\n**Recommended approach**: Implement suggestion #2 (override render() in ManagementForm) as it's the most targeted fix that addresses the root cause without affecting other forms or requiring complex conditional logic in the core warning system.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",
