Now I have complete understanding of the bug and can provide the precise locations that need to be fixed.\n\n## Bug Analysis Summary\n\n**Root Cause**: In `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py`, the `resolve_redirects` method at line 91 always copies the original request (`req.copy()`) instead of the current modified request, causing HTTP method changes from previous redirects to be lost in redirect chains.\n\n**Problem Scenario**: \n- POST → 303 (converts to GET) → 307 (should preserve GET)\n- But line 91 always copies the original POST request, so the 307 redirect incorrectly uses POST instead of GET\n\n## Precise Bug Locations\n\n**Location 1: Line 91** - The primary bug location where the incorrect copy operation occurs:\n```python\nprepared_request = req.copy()  # BUG: Always copies original request\n```\n\n**Location 2: Lines 88-91** - The initialization and loop context that needs modification to handle the first iteration vs subsequent iterations:\n```python\ni = 0\n\nwhile resp.is_redirect:\n    prepared_request = req.copy()  # This line needs conditional logic\n```\n\n**Location 3: Lines 124-138** - The method determination logic that correctly updates the method but gets overwritten in the next iteration:\n```python\n# Method determination logic (lines 124-136)\nif resp.status_code == codes.see_other and method != 'HEAD':\n    method = 'GET'\n# ... other method logic ...\n\n# Line 138: Method update that gets lost\nprepared_request.method = method\n```\n\n## Required Fix Strategy\n\nThe fix needs to modify line 91 to use conditional logic:\n- **First iteration (i == 0)**: Copy the original request (`req.copy()`)\n- **Subsequent iterations (i > 0)**: Copy the current `prepared_request` to preserve method changes\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\n`Session.resolve_redirects` copies the original request for all subsequent requests, can cause incorrect method selection\nConsider the following redirection chain:\n\n```\nPOST /do_something HTTP/1.1\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 303 See Other\nLocation: /new_thing_1513\n\nGET /new_thing_1513\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect\nLocation: //failover.example.com/new_thing_1513\n```\n\nThe intermediate 303 See Other has caused the POST to be converted to\na GET.  The subsequent 307 should preserve the GET.  However, because\n`Session.resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the _original_\nrequest object, Requests will issue a POST!\n\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list. It must follow the following structure:  example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/viewcode.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 181,\n            \"end_line\": 276\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/viewcode.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 160,\n            \"end_line\": 178\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n                ",
    "response": "PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug in `Session.resolve_redirects`, I have identified the precise locations where the issue occurs.

Now I have complete understanding of the bug and can provide the precise locations that need to be fixed.\n\n## Bug Analysis Summary\n\n**Root Cause**: In `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py`, the `resolve_redirects` method at line 91 always copies the original request (`req.copy()`) instead of the current modified request, causing HTTP method changes from previous redirects to be lost in redirect chains.\n\n**Problem Scenario**: \n- POST → 303 (converts to GET) → 307 (should preserve GET)\n- But line 91 always copies the original POST request, so the 307 redirect incorrectly uses POST instead of GET\n\n## Precise Bug Locations\n\n**Location 1: Line 91** - The primary bug location where the incorrect copy operation occurs:\n```python\nprepared_request = req.copy()  # BUG: Always copies original request\n```\n\n**Location 2: Lines 88-91** - The initialization and loop context that needs modification to handle the first iteration vs subsequent iterations:\n```python\ni = 0\n\nwhile resp.is_redirect:\n    prepared_request = req.copy()  # This line needs conditional logic\n```\n\n**Location 3: Lines 124-138** - The method determination logic that correctly updates the method but gets overwritten in the next iteration:\n```python\n# Method determination logic (lines 124-136)\nif resp.status_code == codes.see_other and method != 'HEAD':\n    method = 'GET'\n# ... other method logic ...\n\n# Line 138: Method update that gets lost\nprepared_request.method = method\n```\n\n## Required Fix Strategy\n\nThe fix needs to modify line 91 to use conditional logic:\n- **First iteration (i == 0)**: Copy the original request (`req.copy()`)\n- **Subsequent iterations (i > 0)**: Copy the current `prepared_request` to preserve method changes\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug in `Session.resolve_redirects`, I have identified the precise locations where the issue occurs. The root cause is that line 91 always copies the original request instead of preserving method changes from previous redirects in a redirect chain.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 91,\n            \"end_line\": 91\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 88,\n            \"end_line\": 92\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Location 1 (Line 91)**: The primary bug - `prepared_request = req.copy()` always copies the original request, losing method changes from previous redirects.\n\n**Location 2 (Lines 88-92)**: The broader context including loop initialization and the buggy copy operation that needs conditional logic to handle first iteration vs subsequent iterations properly.\n\nThe fix requires modifying line 91 to use conditional logic: copy the original request on first iteration (`i == 0`) but copy the current `prepared_request` on subsequent iterations to preserve method changes like POST→GET conversions from 303 redirects.\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the code, here are the precise repair suggestions for the interconnected bug locations:\n\n1. **Line 91 - Primary Bug Fix**: Replace `prepared_request = req.copy()` with conditional logic to preserve method changes from previous redirects:\n   ```python\n   # Fix: Copy original request only on first iteration, preserve changes on subsequent iterations\n   if i == 0:\n       prepared_request = req.copy()\n   else:\n       prepared_request = prepared_request.copy()\n   ```\n   This ensures that method changes from previous redirects (like POST→GET from 303) are preserved in subsequent redirects (like 307).\n\n2. **Lines 88-92 - Context Integration**: The broader context needs to support the conditional logic by ensuring the loop variable `i` is properly utilized. The existing structure already increments `i` at line 183, so the conditional logic in suggestion 1 will work correctly with the current loop structure.\n\n**How these suggestions work together:**\n- **First iteration (i=0)**: Copies the original request as intended\n- **Subsequent iterations (i>0)**: Copies the current `prepared_request` which preserves all method changes from previous redirects\n- **Method preservation**: When a 303 converts POST→GET, that GET method is preserved for the next 307 redirect instead of reverting to the original POST\n\nThis fix directly addresses the problem statement where a POST→303(GET)→307 chain incorrectly issues a POST instead of preserving the GET method from the 303 redirect.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 91-91\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            prepared_request = req.copy()\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 88-92\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        i = 0\n\n        while resp.is_redirect:\n            prepared_request = req.copy()\n\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\n`Session.resolve_redirects` copies the original request for all subsequent requests, can cause incorrect method selection\nConsider the following redirection chain:\n\n```\nPOST /do_something HTTP/1.1\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 303 See Other\nLocation: /new_thing_1513\n\nGET /new_thing_1513\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect\nLocation: //failover.example.com/new_thing_1513\n```\n\nThe intermediate 303 See Other has caused the POST to be converted to\na GET.  The subsequent 307 should preserve the GET.  However, because\n`Session.resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the _original_\nrequest object, Requests will issue a POST!\n\n",
    "response": "**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, these locations are ready for fixing. The code segments clearly show the exact problem described in the issue:\n\n**Location 1 (Line 91)**: `prepared_request = req.copy()` - This is the core bug where it always copies the original request (`req`) instead of the current modified request.\n\n**Location 2 (Lines 88-92)**: Shows the complete context with the loop initialization (`i = 0`) and the buggy line within the `while resp.is_redirect:` loop.\n\nThe fix is straightforward and matches the suggestions perfectly:\n- Replace line 91 with conditional logic that copies `req` on first iteration (`i == 0`) but copies the current `prepared_request` on subsequent iterations (`i > 0`)\n- This will preserve method changes from previous redirects (like POST→GET from 303) for subsequent redirects (like 307)\n\nThe locations contain all the necessary context and the exact line that needs modification. The fix will resolve the issue where a POST→303(GET)→307 chain incorrectly issues a POST instead of preserving the GET method.",

The existing structure already increments `i` at line 183, so the conditional logic in suggestion 1 will work correctly with the current loop structure.\n\n**How these suggestions work together:**\n- **First iteration (i=0)**: Copies the original request as intended\n- **Subsequent iterations (i>0)**: Copies the current `prepared_request` which preserves all method changes from previous redirects\n- **Method preservation**: When a 303 converts POST→GET, that GET method is preserved for the next 307 redirect instead of reverting to the original POST\n\nThis fix directly addresses the problem statement where a POST→303(GET)→307 chain incorrectly issues a POST instead of preserving the GET method from the 303 redirect.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 91-91\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            prepared_request = req.copy()\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 88-92\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        i = 0\n\n        while resp.is_redirect:\n            prepared_request = req.copy()\n\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, these locations are ready for fixing. The code segments clearly show the exact problem described in the issue:\n\n**Location 1 (Line 91)**: `prepared_request = req.copy()` - This is the core bug where it always copies the original request (`req`) instead of the current modified request.\n\n**Location 2 (Lines 88-92)**: Shows the complete context with the loop initialization (`i = 0`) and the buggy line within the `while resp.is_redirect:` loop.\n\nThe fix is straightforward and matches the suggestions perfectly:\n- Replace line 91 with conditional logic that copies `req` on first iteration (`i == 0`) but copies the current `prepared_request` on subsequent iterations (`i > 0`)\n- This will preserve method changes from previous redirects (like POST→GET from 303) for subsequent redirects (like 307)\n\nThe locations contain all the necessary context and the exact line that needs modification. The fix will resolve the issue where a POST→303(GET)→307 chain incorrectly issues a POST instead of preserving the GET method.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 91-91\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import os\n  from collections import Mapping\n  from datetime import datetime\n  from .compat import cookielib, OrderedDict, urljoin, urlparse, builtin_str\n  from .cookies import (\n  from .models import Request, PreparedRequest, DEFAULT_REDIRECT_LIMIT\n  from .hooks import default_hooks, dispatch_hook\n  from .utils import to_key_val_list, default_headers, to_native_string\n  from .exceptions import TooManyRedirects, InvalidSchema\n  from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\n  from .adapters import HTTPAdapter\n  from .utils import requote_uri, get_environ_proxies, get_netrc_auth\n  from .status_codes import codes\n  from .models import REDIRECT_STATI\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   81: \n[C]   82: \n[C]   83: class SessionRedirectMixin(object):\n[C]   84:     def resolve_redirects(self, resp, req, stream=False, timeout=None,\n[C]   85:                           verify=True, cert=None, proxies=None):\n[C]   86:         \"\"\"Receives a Response.

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Bug Analysis and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nFind and repair a bug in the `Session.resolve_redirects` method in the requests library where it incorrectly copies the original request instead of the current request, causing HTTP method selection issues in redirect chains.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: Located the main requests module at `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/`\n- **Key Files Identified**: `sessions.py` (contains the buggy method)\n\n### 2. Bug Location and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Results**: Found the `resolve_redirects` method in `SessionRedirectMixin` class (lines 84-185)\n\n### 3. Bug Identification\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py`, line 91\n- **Buggy Code**: `prepared_request = req.copy()`\n- **Problem**: Always copies the original request (`req`) instead of the current modified request\n\n## Technical Details of the Bug\n\n### Current Problematic Flow:\n1. **Line 91**: `prepared_request = req.copy()` - Copies original request\n2. **Lines 124-136**: Correctly determines new HTTP method based on redirect status codes:\n   - 303 redirects → GET (except HEAD)\n   - 302 redirects → GET (except HEAD) \n   - 301 POST redirects → GET\n3. **Line 138**: `prepared_request.method = method` - Updates method correctly\n4. **Next iteration**: Goes back to line 91 and copies original request again, **losing all previous method changes**\n\n### Impact:\nIn redirect chains like `POST → 303 (should become GET) → 307 (should preserve GET)`, the second redirect incorrectly uses POST because it copies the original request instead of the current modified request.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed:\n- Located the bug in `sessions.py` at line 91\n- Understood the complete redirect handling logic\n- Identified the exact cause: copying original request instead of current request\n\n### 🔄 Next Steps Required:\n1. **Fix Implementation**: Change line 91 to copy the current request instead of original\n2. **Handle First Iteration**: Need to handle the first iteration where there's no previous `prepared_request`\n3. **Testing**: Create or run tests to verify the fix works correctly\n4. **Validation**: Ensure the fix doesn't break other functionality\n\n## Proposed Fix Strategy\n\nThe fix needs to modify the logic to:\n- On first iteration: Copy the original request (`req`)\n- On subsequent iterations: Copy the previous `prepared_request` to preserve method changes\n\n**Suggested Implementation**:\n```python\n# Instead of always: prepared_request = req.copy()\n# Use conditional logic to preserve method changes in redirect chains\nif i == 0:\n    prepared_request = req.copy()\nelse:\n    # Copy the current prepared_request to preserve method changes\n    prepared_request = prepared_request.copy()\n```\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Project structure navigation\n- `search_code_with_context`: Locating specific methods\n- `read_file_lines`: Detailed code analysis\n\nThe bug is clearly identified and ready for implementation of the fix.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug clearly! Looking at the code in `resolve_redirects`:\n\n1. **Line 91**: `prepared_request = req.copy()` - This is the bug! It always copies the original request (`req`) instead of the current/modified request.\n\n2. **Lines 124-136**: The method correctly updates the HTTP method based on redirect status codes (303 → GET, 302 → GET, 301 POST → GET).\n\n3. **Line 138**: `prepared_request.method = method` - The method is correctly updated.\n\n4. **The Problem**: In the next iteration of the while loop (line 90), it goes back to line 91 and copies the original request again, losing all the method changes from previous redirects.\n\n**The Bug**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 (converts to GET) → 307 (should preserve GET), the second redirect incorrectly uses POST because it copies the original request instead of the current modified request.\n\n**The Fix**: Line 91 should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req`.\n\nLet me continue reading to see the complete method and identify the exact line ranges that need to be fixed.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 180, \"end_line\": 200 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 571\nShowing lines 180-200:\n\n 180: \n 181:             extract_cookies_to_jar(self.cookies, prepared_request, resp.raw)\n 182: \n 183:             i += 1\n 184:             yield resp\n 185: \n 186: \n 187: class Session(SessionRedirectMixin):\n 188:     \"\"\"A Requests session.\n 189: \n 190:     Provides cookie persistence, connection-pooling, and configuration.\n 191: \n 192:     Basic Usage::\n 193: \n 194:       >>> import requests\n 195:       >>> s = requests.Session()\n 196:       >>> s.get('http://httpbin.org/get')\n 197:       200\n 198:     \"\"\"\n 199: \n 200:     __attrs__ = [\n\n\nAssistant: Perfect!

Now I have all the information I need. Let me analyze the complete bug:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py` in the `resolve_redirects` method\n2. **Problem**: Line 91 always copies the original request (`req.copy()`) instead of the current modified request\n3. **Impact**: In redirect chains, method changes from previous redirects are lost\n\n**The Bug Flow:**\n- POST → 303 (converts to GET) → 307 (should preserve GET)\n- But because line 91 always copies the original POST request, the 307 redirect incorrectly uses POST instead of GET\n\n**Exact Fix Needed:**\nLine 91 needs to be modified to copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req`. However, on the first iteration, there's no previous `prepared_request`, so we need conditional logic.\n\nLet me read the exact lines around the bug to provide precise line ranges.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 88, \"end_line\": 95 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 571\nShowing lines 88-95:\n\n  88:         i = 0\n  89: \n  90:         while resp.is_redirect:\n  91:             prepared_request = req.copy()\n  92: \n  93:             resp.content  # Consume socket so it can be released\n  94: \n  95:             if i >= self.max_redirects:\n\n\nAssistant: Perfect! Now I have complete understanding of the bug and can provide the precise locations that need to be fixed.\n\n## Bug Analysis Summary\n\n**Root Cause**: In `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py`, the `resolve_redirects` method at line 91 always copies the original request (`req.copy()`) instead of the current modified request, causing HTTP method changes from previous redirects to be lost in redirect chains.\n\n**Problem Scenario**: \n- POST → 303 (converts to GET) → 307 (should preserve GET)\n- But line 91 always copies the original POST request, so the 307 redirect incorrectly uses POST instead of GET\n\n## Precise Bug Locations\n\n**Location 1: Line 91** - The primary bug location where the incorrect copy operation occurs:\n```python\nprepared_request = req.copy()  # BUG: Always copies original request\n```\n\n**Location 2: Lines 88-91** - The initialization and loop context that needs modification to handle the first iteration vs subsequent iterations:\n```python\ni = 0\n\nwhile resp.is_redirect:\n    prepared_request = req.copy()  # This line needs conditional logic\n```\n\n**Location 3: Lines 124-138** - The method determination logic that correctly updates the method but gets overwritten in the next iteration:\n```python\n# Method determination logic (lines 124-136)\nif resp.status_code == codes.see_other and method != 'HEAD':\n    method = 'GET'\n# ... other method logic ...\n\n# Line 138: Method update that gets lost\nprepared_request.method = method\n```\n\n## Required Fix Strategy\n\nThe fix needs to modify line 91 to use conditional logic:\n- **First iteration (i == 0)**: Copy the original request (`req.copy()`)\n- **Subsequent iterations (i > 0)**: Copy the current `prepared_request` to preserve method changes\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug in `Session.resolve_redirects`, I have identified the precise locations where the issue occurs. The root cause is that line 91 always copies the original request instead of preserving method changes from previous redirects in a redirect chain.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 91,\n            \"end_line\": 91\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 88,\n            \"end_line\": 92\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Location 1 (Line 91)**: The primary bug - `prepared_request = req.copy()` always copies the original request, losing method changes from previous redirects.\n\n**Location 2 (Lines 88-92)**: The broader context including loop initialization and the buggy copy operation that needs conditional logic to handle first iteration vs subsequent iterations properly.\n\nThe fix requires modifying line 91 to use conditional logic: copy the original request on first iteration (`i == 0`) but copy the current `prepared_request` on subsequent iterations to preserve method changes like POST→GET conversions from 303 redirects.\nAssistant: PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the code, here are the precise repair suggestions for the interconnected bug locations:\n\n1. **Line 91 - Primary Bug Fix**: Replace `prepared_request = req.copy()` with conditional logic to preserve method changes from previous redirects:\n   ```python\n   # Fix: Copy original request only on first iteration, preserve changes on subsequent iterations\n   if i == 0:\n       prepared_request = req.copy()\n   else:\n       prepared_request = prepared_request.copy()\n   ```\n   This ensures that method changes from previous redirects (like POST→GET from 303) are preserved in subsequent redirects (like 307).\n\n2. **Lines 88-92 - Context Integration**: The broader context needs to support the conditional logic by ensuring the loop variable `i` is properly utilized. The existing structure already increments `i` at line 183, so the conditional logic in suggestion 1 will work correctly with the current loop structure.\n\n**How these suggestions work together:**\n- **First iteration (i=0)**: Copies the original request as intended\n- **Subsequent iterations (i>0)**: Copies the current `prepared_request` which preserves all method changes from previous redirects\n- **Method preservation**: When a 303 converts POST→GET, that GET method is preserved for the next 307 redirect instead of reverting to the original POST\n\nThis fix directly addresses the problem statement where a POST→303(GET)→307 chain incorrectly issues a POST instead of preserving the GET method from the 303 redirect.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 91-91\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            prepared_request = req.copy()\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 88-92\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        i = 0\n\n        while resp.is_redirect:\n            prepared_request = req.copy()\n\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\nAssistant: **CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, these locations are ready for fixing. The code segments clearly show the exact problem described in the issue:\n\n**Location 1 (Line 91)**: `prepared_request = req.copy()` - This is the core bug where it always copies the original request (`req`) instead of the current modified request.\n\n**Location 2 (Lines 88-92)**: Shows the complete context with the loop initialization (`i = 0`) and the buggy line within the `while resp.is_redirect:` loop.\n\nThe fix is straightforward and matches the suggestions perfectly:\n- Replace line 91 with conditional logic that copies `req` on first iteration (`i == 0`) but copies the current `prepared_request` on subsequent iterations (`i > 0`)\n- This will preserve method changes from previous redirects (like POST→GET from 303) for subsequent redirects (like 307)\n\nThe locations contain all the necessary context and the exact line that needs modification. The fix will resolve the issue where a POST→303(GET)→307 chain incorrectly issues a POST instead of preserving the GET method.\nUser: [Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 91-91\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import os\n  from collections import Mapping\n  from datetime import datetime\n  from .compat import cookielib, OrderedDict, urljoin, urlparse, builtin_str\n  from .cookies import (\n  from .models import Request, PreparedRequest, DEFAULT_REDIRECT_LIMIT\n  from .hooks import default_hooks, dispatch_hook\n  from .utils import to_key_val_list, default_headers, to_native_string\n  from .exceptions import TooManyRedirects, InvalidSchema\n  from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\n  from .adapters import HTTPAdapter\n  from .utils import requote_uri, get_environ_proxies, get_netrc_auth\n  from .status_codes import codes\n  from .models import REDIRECT_STATI\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   81: \n[C]   82: \n[C]   83: class SessionRedirectMixin(object):\n[C]   84:     def resolve_redirects(self, resp, req, stream=False, timeout=None,\n[C]   85:                           verify=True, cert=None, proxies=None):\n[C]   86:         \"\"\"Receives a Response.

The existing structure already increments `i` at line 183, so the conditional logic in suggestion 1 will work correctly with the current loop structure.\n\n**How these suggestions work together:**\n- **First iteration (i=0)**: Copies the original request as intended\n- **Subsequent iterations (i>0)**: Copies the current `prepared_request` which preserves all method changes from previous redirects\n- **Method preservation**: When a 303 converts POST→GET, that GET method is preserved for the next 307 redirect instead of reverting to the original POST\n\nThis fix directly addresses the problem statement where a POST→303(GET)→307 chain incorrectly issues a POST instead of preserving the GET method from the 303 redirect.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nLooking at the bug locations and the suggestions, I need to implement the fix that addresses the core issue: line 91 always copies the original request (`req.copy()`) instead of preserving method changes from previous redirects.\n\nThe fix needs to:\n1.

    "response": "# Bug Analysis and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nFind and repair a bug in the `Session.resolve_redirects` method in the requests library where it incorrectly copies the original request instead of the current request, causing HTTP method selection issues in redirect chains.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: Located the main requests module at `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/`\n- **Key Files Identified**: `sessions.py` (contains the buggy method), `test_requests.py` (testing file)\n\n### 2. Bug Location and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Results**: Found the `resolve_redirects` method in `SessionRedirectMixin` class (lines 84-185)\n\n### 3. Complete Bug Identification and Analysis\n- **Location**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/sessions.py`, line 91\n- **Buggy Code**: `prepared_request = req.copy()`\n- **Problem**: Always copies the original request (`req`) instead of the current modified request\n- **Context**: Lines 88-92 show the loop structure with initialization `i = 0` and the while loop\n\n## Technical Details of the Bug\n\n### Current Problematic Flow:\n1. **Line 88**: `i = 0` - Loop counter initialization\n2. **Line 90**: `while resp.is_redirect:` - Redirect handling loop\n3. **Line 91**: `prepared_request = req.copy()` - **BUG**: Copies original request\n4. **Lines 124-136**: Correctly determines new HTTP method based on redirect status codes:\n   - 303 redirects → GET (except HEAD)\n   - 302 redirects → GET (except HEAD) \n   - 301 POST redirects → GET\n5. **Line 138**: `prepared_request.method = method` - Updates method correctly\n6. **Line 183**: `i += 1` - Increments counter\n7. **Next iteration**: Goes back to line 91 and copies original request again, **losing all previous method changes**\n\n### Impact:\nIn redirect chains like `POST → 303 (should become GET) → 307 (should preserve GET)`, the second redirect incorrectly uses POST because it copies the original request instead of the current modified request.\n\n## Precise Bug Locations Identified\n\n### Location 1: Line 91 (Primary Bug)\n```python\nprepared_request = req.copy()  # Always copies original request\n```\n\n### Location 2: Lines 88-92 (Context Integration)\n```python\ni = 0\n\nwhile resp.is_redirect:\n    prepared_request = req.copy()  # Needs conditional logic\n```\n\n## Fix Implementation Strategy\n\n### Proposed Solution:\nReplace the unconditional `req.copy()` with conditional logic:\n- **First iteration (i == 0)**: Copy the original request (`req.copy()`)\n- **Subsequent iterations (i > 0)**: Copy the current `prepared_request` to preserve method changes\n\n### Patch Implementation:\n\n**Patch 1 (Line 91 replacement):**\n```python\nif i == 0:\n    prepared_request = req.copy()\nelse:\n    prepared_request = prepared_request.copy()\n```\n\n**Patch 2 (Lines 88-92 replacement):**\n```python\ni = 0\n\nwhile resp.is_redirect:\n    if i == 0:\n        prepared_request = req.copy()\n    else:\n        prepared_request = prepared_request.copy()\n```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed:\n- Located the bug in `sessions.py` at line 91\n- Understood the complete redirect handling logic and loop structure\n- Identified the exact cause: copying original request instead of current request\n- Analyzed the broader context (lines 88-92) for proper integration\n- Confirmed loop counter `i` is properly incremented at line 183\n- Verified indentation requirements (12 spaces for line 91, 8 spaces for loop level)\n- **PROPOSED PATCHES**: Ready for implementation with proper conditional logic\n\n### 🔄 Next Steps Required:\n1. **Apply Patches**: Implement the conditional logic fixes\n2. **Testing**: Create or run tests to verify the fix works correctly\n3. **Validation**: Ensure the fix doesn't break other functionality\n\n## Technical Validation\n\n### How the Fix Works:\n- **First iteration (i=0)**: Copies the original request as intended\n- **Subsequent iterations (i>0)**: Copies the current `prepared_request` which preserves all method changes from previous redirects\n- **Method preservation**: When a 303 converts POST→GET, that GET method is preserved for the next 307 redirect instead of reverting to the original POST\n\n### Import Analysis:\n- No additional imports required\n- All necessary classes (`PreparedRequest`, etc.) already imported\n- Fix uses existing functionality (`copy()` method)\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Project structure navigation\n- `search_code_with_context`: Locating specific methods\n- `read_file_lines`: Detailed code analysis and context verification\n\nThe bug is fully analyzed with precise patches ready for implementation. The fix directly addresses the problem statement where a POST→303(GET)→307 chain incorrectly issues a POST instead of preserving the GET method from the 303 redirect.",
