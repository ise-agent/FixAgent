    "response": "# Summary: Bug Fix for Socket Error Exception Handling in Requests Library\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in the requests library where `socket.error` exceptions are not being properly caught and wrapped in requests-specific exceptions like `ConnectionError`. This causes raw socket errors to bubble up to users instead of being handled gracefully.\n\n## Key Investigation Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Analysis\n- **Target Project**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests` - A Python HTTP library\n- **Key Files Identified**:\n  - `requests/exceptions.py` - Contains all custom exception definitions\n  - `requests/models.py` - Contains response handling logic where the bug occurs\n\n### 2. Exception Hierarchy Understanding\nFrom `exceptions.py`, the relevant exception classes are:\n- `RequestException` (base class, inherits from IOError)\n- `ConnectionError` (inherits from RequestException) - **This should wrap socket errors**\n- `ChunkedEncodingError` (inherits from RequestException)\n- `ContentDecodingError` (inherits from RequestException)\n\n### 3. Bug Location Identified\n**File**: `requests/models.py`\n**Method**: `iter_content()` (lines 633-660) and `content` property (lines 690-710)\n\n**Current Exception Handling** (lines 634-642):\n```python\ntry:\n    for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):\n        yield chunk\nexcept IncompleteRead as e:\n    raise ChunkedEncodingError(e)\nexcept DecodeError as e:\n    raise ContentDecodingError(e)\n```\n\n### 4. Root Cause Analysis\n- The `iter_content()` method catches `IncompleteRead` and `DecodeError` exceptions\n- **Missing**: No handling for `socket.error` exceptions that can occur during `self.raw.stream()` operations\n- The `content` property calls `iter_content()` at line 704, so socket errors propagate through this chain\n- Socket errors should be wrapped in `ConnectionError` to maintain API consistency\n\n## Current Status\n- **Investigation Phase**: Complete\n- **Bug Identified**: Yes - Missing socket.error exception handling in `iter_content()` method\n- **Solution Required**: Add socket.error exception catching and wrap in ConnectionError\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Import socket module** in `models.py` (currently not imported)\n2. **Add socket.error exception handling** in the `iter_content()` method's try-except block\n3. **Wrap socket errors in ConnectionError** to maintain API consistency\n4. **Test the fix** to ensure socket errors are properly handled\n\n## Technical Implementation Plan\nThe fix should add this exception handling in `models.py` around line 640:\n```python\nexcept socket.error as e:\n    raise ConnectionError(e)\n```\n\nThis will ensure that any socket-level errors during response content reading are properly wrapped in the requests library's exception hierarchy, providing a consistent API experience for users.",

Exception Hierarchy Understanding\nFrom `exceptions.py`, the relevant exception classes are:\n- `RequestException` (base class, inherits from IOError)\n- `ConnectionError` (inherits from RequestException) - **This should wrap socket errors**\n- `ChunkedEncodingError` (inherits from RequestException)\n- `ContentDecodingError` (inherits from RequestException)\n\n### 3. Bug Location Identified\n**File**: `requests/models.py`\n**Method**: `iter_content()` (lines 633-660) and `content` property (lines 690-710)\n\n**Current Exception Handling** (lines 634-642):\n```python\ntry:\n    for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):\n        yield chunk\nexcept IncompleteRead as e:\n    raise ChunkedEncodingError(e)\nexcept DecodeError as e:\n    raise ContentDecodingError(e)\n```\n\n### 4. Root Cause Analysis\n- The `iter_content()` method catches `IncompleteRead` and `DecodeError` exceptions\n- **Missing**: No handling for `socket.error` exceptions that can occur during `self.raw.stream()` operations\n- The `content` property calls `iter_content()` at line 704, so socket errors propagate through this chain\n- Socket errors should be wrapped in `ConnectionError` to maintain API consistency\n\n## Current Status\n- **Investigation Phase**: Complete\n- **Bug Identified**: Yes - Missing socket.error exception handling in `iter_content()` method\n- **Solution Required**: Add socket.error exception catching and wrap in ConnectionError\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Import socket module** in `models.py` (currently not imported)\n2. **Add socket.error exception handling** in the `iter_content()` method's try-except block\n3. **Wrap socket errors in ConnectionError** to maintain API consistency\n4. **Test the fix** to ensure socket errors are properly handled\n\n## Technical Implementation Plan\nThe fix should add this exception handling in `models.py` around line 640:\n```python\nexcept socket.error as e:\n    raise ConnectionError(e)\n```\n\nThis will ensure that any socket-level errors during response content reading are properly wrapped in the requests library's exception hierarchy, providing a consistent API experience for users.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I need to see the `content` property that's mentioned in the stack trace to understand the full flow:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\", \"start_line\": 690, \"end_line\": 710 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nTotal lines: 813\nShowing lines 690-710:\n\n 690:     @property\n 691:     def content(self):\n 692:         \"\"\"Content of the response, in bytes.\"\"\"\n 693: \n 694:         if self._content is False:\n 695:             # Read the contents.\n 696:             try:\n 697:                 if self._content_consumed:\n 698:                     raise RuntimeError(\n 699:                         'The content for this response was already consumed')\n 700: \n 701:                 if self.status_code == 0:\n 702:                     self._content = None\n 703:                 else:\n 704:                     self._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()\n 705: \n 706:             except AttributeError:\n 707:                 self._content = None\n 708: \n 709:         self._content_consumed = True\n 710:         # don't need to release the connection; that's been handled by urllib3\n\nNow I need to check what imports are available in the models.py file to see if socket is imported and what exception handling is already in place:\n\n#TOOL_CALL show_file_imports { \"python_file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\n['\\nimport collections\\n', 'import datetime\\n', '\\nfrom io import BytesIO, UnsupportedOperation\\n', 'from .hooks import default_hooks\\n', 'from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\\n', '\\nfrom .auth import HTTPBasicAuth\\n', 'from .cookies import cookiejar_from_dict, get_cookie_header\\n', 'from .packages.urllib3.fields import RequestField\\n', 'from .packages.urllib3.filepost import encode_multipart_formdata\\n', 'from .packages.urllib3.util import parse_url\\n', 'from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import DecodeError\\n', 'from .exceptions import (\\n', 'from .utils import (\\n', 'from .compat import (\\n', 'from .status_codes import codes\\n']\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1.

Root Cause Analysis\n- The `iter_content()` method catches `IncompleteRead` and `DecodeError` exceptions\n- **Missing**: No handling for `socket.error` exceptions that can occur during `self.raw.stream()` operations\n- The `content` property calls `iter_content()` at line 704, so socket errors propagate through this chain\n- Socket errors should be wrapped in `ConnectionError` to maintain API consistency\n\n## Current Status\n- **Investigation Phase**: Complete\n- **Bug Identified**: Yes - Missing socket.error exception handling in `iter_content()` method\n- **Solution Required**: Add socket.error exception catching and wrap in ConnectionError\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Import socket module** in `models.py` (currently not imported)\n2. **Add socket.error exception handling** in the `iter_content()` method's try-except block\n3. **Wrap socket errors in ConnectionError** to maintain API consistency\n4. **Test the fix** to ensure socket errors are properly handled\n\n## Technical Implementation Plan\nThe fix should add this exception handling in `models.py` around line 640:\n```python\nexcept socket.error as e:\n    raise ConnectionError(e)\n```\n\nThis will ensure that any socket-level errors during response content reading are properly wrapped in the requests library's exception hierarchy, providing a consistent API experience for users.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I need to see the `content` property that's mentioned in the stack trace to understand the full flow:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\", \"start_line\": 690, \"end_line\": 710 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nTotal lines: 813\nShowing lines 690-710:\n\n 690:     @property\n 691:     def content(self):\n 692:         \"\"\"Content of the response, in bytes.\"\"\"\n 693: \n 694:         if self._content is False:\n 695:             # Read the contents.\n 696:             try:\n 697:                 if self._content_consumed:\n 698:                     raise RuntimeError(\n 699:                         'The content for this response was already consumed')\n 700: \n 701:                 if self.status_code == 0:\n 702:                     self._content = None\n 703:                 else:\n 704:                     self._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()\n 705: \n 706:             except AttributeError:\n 707:                 self._content = None\n 708: \n 709:         self._content_consumed = True\n 710:         # don't need to release the connection;

Currently only catches `IncompleteRead` and `DecodeError` but misses `socket.error` exceptions that occur during `self.raw.stream()` operations.\n\nThe stack trace shows the error flows from `response.text` → `content` property (line 704) → `iter_content()` → `self.raw.stream()` where socket errors occur but are not caught, causing raw socket exceptions to bubble up instead of being wrapped in requests-specific exceptions.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nsocket.error exception not caught/wrapped in a requests exception (ConnectionError perhaps?)\nI just noticed a case where I had a socket reset on me, and was raised to me as a raw socket error as opposed to something like a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:\n\n```\n  File \"/home/rtdean/***/***/***/***/***/***.py\", line 67, in dir_parse\n    root = ElementTree.fromstring(response.text)\n  File \"/home/rtdean/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests-2.3.0-py2.7.egg/requests/models.py\", line 721, in text\n    if not self.content:\n  File \"/home/rtdean/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests-2.3.0-py2.7.egg/requests/models.py\", line 694, in content\n    self._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()\n  File \"/home/rtdean/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests-2.3.0-py2.7.egg/requests/models.py\", line 627, in generate\n    for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):\n  File \"/home/rtdean/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests-2.3.0-py2.7.egg/requests/packages/urllib3/response.py\", line 240, in stream\n    data = self.read(amt=amt, decode_content=decode_content)\n  File \"/home/rtdean/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests-2.3.0-py2.7.egg/requests/packages/urllib3/response.py\", line 187, in read\n    data = self._fp.read(amt)\n  File \"/home/rtdean/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 543, in read\n    return self._read_chunked(amt)\n  File \"/home/rtdean/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 612, in _read_chunked\n    value.append(self._safe_read(chunk_left))\n  File \"/home/rtdean/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 658, in _safe_read\n    chunk = self.fp.read(min(amt, MAXAMOUNT))\n  File \"/home/rtdean/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6/lib/python2.7/socket.py\", line 380, in read\n    data = self._sock.recv(left)\n  File \"/home/rtdean/.pyenv/versions/2.7.6/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gevent-1.0.1-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg/gevent/socket.py\", line 385, in recv\n    return sock.recv(*args)\nsocket.error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer\n```\n\nNot sure if this is by accident or design... in general, I guess I'd expect a requests exception when using requests, but I can start looking for socket errors and the like as well.\n\n",

This causes raw socket errors to bubble up to users instead of being handled gracefully.\n\n## Key Investigation Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Analysis\n- **Target Project**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests` - A Python HTTP library\n- **Key Files Identified**:\n  - `requests/exceptions.py` - Contains all custom exception definitions\n  - `requests/models.py` - Contains response handling logic where the bug occurs\n\n### 2. Exception Hierarchy Understanding\nFrom `exceptions.py`, the relevant exception classes are:\n- `RequestException` (base class, inherits from IOError)\n- `ConnectionError` (inherits from RequestException) - **This should wrap socket errors**\n- `ChunkedEncodingError` (inherits from RequestException)\n- `ContentDecodingError` (inherits from RequestException)\n\n### 3. Bug Location Identified\n**File**: `requests/models.py`\n**Method**: `iter_content()` (lines 633-660) and `content` property (lines 690-710)\n\n**Current Exception Handling** (lines 634-642):\n```python\ntry:\n    for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):\n        yield chunk\nexcept IncompleteRead as e:\n    raise ChunkedEncodingError(e)\nexcept DecodeError as e:\n    raise ContentDecodingError(e)\n```\n\n### 4. Root Cause Analysis\n- The `iter_content()` method catches `IncompleteRead` and `DecodeError` exceptions\n- **Missing**: No handling for `socket.error` exceptions that can occur during `self.raw.stream()` operations\n- The `content` property calls `iter_content()` at line 704, so socket errors propagate through this chain\n- Socket errors should be wrapped in `ConnectionError` to maintain API consistency\n\n## Current Status\n- **Investigation Phase**: Complete\n- **Bug Identified**: Yes - Missing socket.error exception handling in `iter_content()` method\n- **Solution Required**: Add socket.error exception catching and wrap in ConnectionError\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Import socket module** in `models.py` (currently not imported)\n2. **Add socket.error exception handling** in the `iter_content()` method's try-except block\n3. **Wrap socket errors in ConnectionError** to maintain API consistency\n4. **Test the fix** to ensure socket errors are properly handled\n\n## Technical Implementation Plan\nThe fix should add this exception handling in `models.py` around line 640:\n```python\nexcept socket.error as e:\n    raise ConnectionError(e)\n```\n\nThis will ensure that any socket-level errors during response content reading are properly wrapped in the requests library's exception hierarchy, providing a consistent API experience for users.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nStart line: 10\nEnd line: 12\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nStart line: 634\nEnd line: 642\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where `socket.error` exceptions are not being caught and wrapped in requests-specific exceptions, here are my coordinated repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Import section, lines 10-12]**: Add `import socket` after the existing standard library imports to make `socket.error` available for exception handling.

This causes raw socket errors to bubble up to users instead of being handled gracefully.\n\n## Key Investigation Results\n\n### 1. Project Structure Analysis\n- **Target Project**: `/root/hy/projects_4/requests` - A Python HTTP library\n- **Key Files Identified**:\n  - `requests/exceptions.py` - Contains all custom exception definitions\n  - `requests/models.py` - Contains response handling logic where the bug occurs\n\n### 2. Exception Hierarchy Understanding\nFrom `exceptions.py`, the relevant exception classes are:\n- `RequestException` (base class, inherits from IOError)\n- `ConnectionError` (inherits from RequestException) - **This should wrap socket errors**\n- `ChunkedEncodingError` (inherits from RequestException)\n- `ContentDecodingError` (inherits from RequestException)\n\n### 3. Bug Location Identified\n**File**: `requests/models.py`\n**Method**: `iter_content()` (lines 633-660) and `content` property (lines 690-710)\n\n**Current Exception Handling** (lines 634-642):\n```python\ntry:\n    for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):\n        yield chunk\nexcept IncompleteRead as e:\n    raise ChunkedEncodingError(e)\nexcept DecodeError as e:\n    raise ContentDecodingError(e)\n```\n\n### 4. Root Cause Analysis\n- The `iter_content()` method catches `IncompleteRead` and `DecodeError` exceptions\n- **Missing**: No handling for `socket.error` exceptions that can occur during `self.raw.stream()` operations\n- The `content` property calls `iter_content()` at line 704, so socket errors propagate through this chain\n- Socket errors should be wrapped in `ConnectionError` to maintain API consistency\n\n## Current Status\n- **Investigation Phase**: Complete\n- **Bug Identified**: Yes - Missing socket.error exception handling in `iter_content()` method\n- **Solution Required**: Add socket.error exception catching and wrap in ConnectionError\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Import socket module** in `models.py` (currently not imported)\n2. **Add socket.error exception handling** in the `iter_content()` method's try-except block\n3. **Wrap socket errors in ConnectionError** to maintain API consistency\n4. **Test the fix** to ensure socket errors are properly handled\n\n## Technical Implementation Plan\nThe fix should add this exception handling in `models.py` around line 640:\n```python\nexcept socket.error as e:\n    raise ConnectionError(e)\n```\n\nThis will ensure that any socket-level errors during response content reading are properly wrapped in the requests library's exception hierarchy, providing a consistent API experience for users.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nStart line: 10\nEnd line: 12\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nStart line: 634\nEnd line: 642\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug where `socket.error` exceptions are not being caught and wrapped in requests-specific exceptions, here are my coordinated repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Import section, lines 10-12]**: Add `import socket` after the existing standard library imports to make `socket.error` available for exception handling. This import is required for location 2 to function properly.\n\n2. **[Exception handling in iter_content method, lines 634-642]**: Extend the existing try-except block to catch `socket.error` exceptions and wrap them in `ConnectionError`. Add the following exception handler after the existing `DecodeError` handler:\n   ```python\n   except socket.error as e:\n       raise ConnectionError(e)\n   ```\n\n**Coordination between fixes:**\n- Location 1 provides the necessary import that location 2 depends on\n- Location 2 implements the actual exception wrapping that solves the user-reported issue\n- Together, they ensure that socket-level errors during response content reading (as shown in the stack trace: `response.text` → `content` property → `iter_content()` → `self.raw.stream()`) are properly wrapped in the requests library's `ConnectionError` exception hierarchy\n- This maintains API consistency by ensuring users receive requests-specific exceptions rather than raw socket errors, which aligns with the framework's design pattern of abstracting lower-level implementation details\n\nThe fix addresses the exact scenario described in the problem statement where a socket reset (`socket.error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer`) should be wrapped in a `ConnectionError` instead of bubbling up as a raw socket exception.\nNote that the Patch provided should be a direct substitution of the location code by the Locator.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I need to see the `content` property that's mentioned in the stack trace to understand the full flow:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\", \"start_line\": 690, \"end_line\": 710 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nTotal lines: 813\nShowing lines 690-710:\n\n 690:     @property\n 691:     def content(self):\n 692:         \"\"\"Content of the response, in bytes.\"\"\"\n 693: \n 694:         if self._content is False:\n 695:             # Read the contents.\n 696:             try:\n 697:                 if self._content_consumed:\n 698:                     raise RuntimeError(\n 699:                         'The content for this response was already consumed')\n 700: \n 701:                 if self.status_code == 0:\n 702:                     self._content = None\n 703:                 else:\n 704:                     self._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()\n 705: \n 706:             except AttributeError:\n 707:                 self._content = None\n 708: \n 709:         self._content_consumed = True\n 710:         # don't need to release the connection; that's been handled by urllib3\n\nNow I need to check what imports are available in the models.py file to see if socket is imported and what exception handling is already in place:\n\n#TOOL_CALL show_file_imports { \"python_file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\n['\\nimport collections\\n', 'import datetime\\n', '\\nfrom io import BytesIO, UnsupportedOperation\\n', 'from .hooks import default_hooks\\n', 'from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\\n', '\\nfrom .auth import HTTPBasicAuth\\n', 'from .cookies import cookiejar_from_dict, get_cookie_header\\n', 'from .packages.urllib3.fields import RequestField\\n', 'from .packages.urllib3.filepost import encode_multipart_formdata\\n', 'from .packages.urllib3.util import parse_url\\n', 'from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import DecodeError\\n', 'from .exceptions import (\\n', 'from .utils import (\\n', 'from .compat import (\\n', 'from .status_codes import codes\\n']\n#REFLECT\nBased on the investigation, I now have a clear understanding of the bug:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Root Cause**: The `iter_content()` method in `models.py` (lines 633-660) catches `IncompleteRead` and `DecodeError` exceptions but does NOT catch `socket.error` exceptions that can occur during `self.raw.stream()` operations.\n\n2. **Exception Flow**: The stack trace shows:\n   - `response.text` → `content` property (line 704) → `iter_content()` (line 627) → `self.raw.stream()` → socket operations\n   - When a socket error occurs, it bubbles up as a raw `socket.error` instead of being wrapped in `ConnectionError`\n\n3. **Missing Import**: The `socket` module is not imported in `models.py`, which is needed to catch `socket.error`\n\n4. **Expected Behavior**: Socket errors should be wrapped in `ConnectionError` to maintain API consistency\n\n**Locations to Fix:**\n1. **Import section** (around line 1-20): Add `import socket`\n2. **iter_content method exception handling** (around lines 640-642): Add socket.error exception handling\n\nLet me now identify the exact line ranges for the fix.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 20 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/requests/requests/models.py\nTotal lines: 813\nShowing lines 1-20:\n\n   1: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n   2: \n   3: \"\"\"\n   4: requests.models\n   5: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n   6: \n   7: This module contains the primary objects that power Requests.\n   8: \"\"\"\n   9: \n  10: import collections\n  11: import datetime\n  12: \n  13: from io import BytesIO, UnsupportedOperation\n  14: from .hooks import default_hooks\n  15: from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\n  16: \n  17: from .auth import HTTPBasicAuth\n  18: from .cookies import cookiejar_from_dict, get_cookie_header\n  19: from .packages.urllib3.fields import RequestField\n  20: from .packages.urllib3.filepost import encode_multipart_formdata\n\nBased on my analysis of the code and the problem description, I have identified the bug and the locations that need to be fixed. The issue is that `socket.error` exceptions are not being caught and wrapped in requests-specific exceptions during response content reading.\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\nThe stack trace shows the error flow:\n1. `response.text` → `content` property (line 704) → `iter_content()` (line 627) → `self.raw.stream()` → socket operations\n2.
