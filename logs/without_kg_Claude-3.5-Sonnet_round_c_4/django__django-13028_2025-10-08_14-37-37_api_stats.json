The problem is that when a Django model has a field named `filterable`, Django's ORM raises a `NotSupportedError` when trying to filter using that model as a foreign key value. The error occurs in `check_filterable` method in the SQL query module. \n\nThe issue seems to be that Django is checking if the RHS (right-hand side) of the filter has a `filterable` attribute and treats it as `False`, causing it to be disallowed in filter clauses. This is likely a naming conflict where Django's internal `filterable` attribute conflicts with the user's model field.\n\nLet me start by exploring the Django project structure to understand how it's organized, then locate the `check_filterable` method mentioned in the traceback.\n\n#TOOL_CALL explore_directory { \"dir_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nContents of /root/hy/projects_4/django:\n.editorconfig\n.eslintignore\n.eslintrc\n.gitattributes\n.github/\n.gitignore\n.hgignore\n.tx/\nAUTHORS\nCONTRIBUTING.rst\nGruntfile.js\nINSTALL\nLICENSE\nLICENSE.python\nMANIFEST.in\nREADME.rst\ndjango/\ndocs/\nextras/\njs_tests/\npackage.json\nscripts/\nsetup.cfg\nsetup.py\ntests/\ntox.ini\n\nNow I can see this is a Django project.

The problem is that when a Django model has a field named `filterable`, Django's ORM raises a `NotSupportedError` when trying to filter using that model as a foreign key value. The error occurs in `check_filterable` method in the SQL query module. \n\nThe issue seems to be that Django is checking if the RHS (right-hand side) of the filter has a `filterable` attribute and treats it as `False`, causing it to be disallowed in filter clauses. This is likely a naming conflict where Django's internal `filterable` attribute conflicts with the user's model field.\n\nLet me start by exploring the Django project structure to understand how it's organized, then locate the `check_filterable` method mentioned in the traceback.\n\n#TOOL_CALL explore_directory { \"dir_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nContents of /root/hy/projects_4/django:\n.editorconfig\n.eslintignore\n.eslintrc\n.gitattributes\n.github/\n.gitignore\n.hgignore\n.tx/\nAUTHORS\nCONTRIBUTING.rst\nGruntfile.js\nINSTALL\nLICENSE\nLICENSE.python\nMANIFEST.in\nREADME.rst\ndjango/\ndocs/\nextras/\njs_tests/\npackage.json\nscripts/\nsetup.cfg\nsetup.py\ntests/\ntox.ini\n\nNow I can see this is a Django project. The bug is in the queryset filtering logic where a model with a `filterable` field causes a `NotSupportedError`. Let me look at the specific file mentioned in the traceback - the SQL query module where `check_filterable` is defined.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", \"start_line\": 1125, \"end_line\": 1140 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\nTotal lines: 2414\nShowing lines 1125-1140:\n\n1125:     def check_filterable(self, expression):\n1126:         \"\"\"Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause.\"\"\"\n1127:         if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n1128:             raise NotSupportedError(\n1129:                 expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '\n1130:                 'clause.'\n1131:             )\n1132:         if hasattr(expression, 'get_source_expressions'):\n1133:             for expr in expression.get_source_expressions():\n1134:                 self.check_filterable(expr)\n1135: \n1136:     def build_lookup(self, lookups, lhs, rhs):\n1137:         \"\"\"\n1138:         Try to extract transforms and lookup from given lhs.\n1139: \n1140:         The lhs value is something that works like SQLExpression.\n\nNow I understand the bug!

When the user's `filterable` field is `False` (as in the `ProductMetaDataType` model), Django incorrectly thinks the model instance is not filterable and raises the error.\n\nLet me look at the broader context around this method to understand how it's called and what the proper fix should be.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", \"start_line\": 1250, \"end_line\": 1280 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\nTotal lines: 2414\nShowing lines 1250-1280:\n\n1250:             clause = self.where_class()\n1251:             clause.add(condition, AND)\n1252:             return clause, []\n1253:         arg, value = filter_expr\n1254:         if not arg:\n1255:             raise FieldError(\"Cannot parse keyword query %r\" % arg)\n1256:         lookups, parts, reffed_expression = self.solve_lookup_type(arg)\n1257: \n1258:         if check_filterable:\n1259:             self.check_filterable(reffed_expression)\n1260: \n1261:         if not allow_joins and len(parts) > 1:\n1262:             raise FieldError(\"Joined field references are not permitted in this query\")\n1263: \n1264:         pre_joins = self.alias_refcount.copy()\n1265:         value = self.resolve_lookup_value(value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n1266:         used_joins = {k for k, v in self.alias_refcount.items() if v > pre_joins.get(k, 0)}\n1267: \n1268:         if check_filterable:\n1269:             self.check_filterable(value)\n1270: \n1271:         clause = self.where_class()\n1272:         if reffed_expression:\n1273:             condition = self.build_lookup(lookups, reffed_expression, value)\n1274:             clause.add(condition, AND)\n1275:             return clause, []\n1276: \n1277:         opts = self.get_meta()\n1278:         alias = self.get_initial_alias()\n1279:         allow_many = not branch_negated or not split_subq\n1280: \n\nI can see the issue clearly now. Looking at line 1269 in the traceback, `self.check_filterable(value)` is being called where `value` is the `ProductMetaDataType` model instance. The problem is in the `check_filterable` method at line 1127:\n\n```python\nif not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n```\n\nWhen `expression` is a `ProductMetaDataType` instance with a `filterable` field set to `False`, `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` returns the value of the model's `filterable` field instead of Django's internal filterable attribute. Since the user's field is `False`, the condition becomes `if not False:` which is `True`, so it raises the `NotSupportedError`.\n\nThe fix needs to distinguish between Django's internal `filterable` attribute and user-defined model fields. Let me look at how Django's internal objects define their `filterable` attribute to understand the proper solution.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"filterable = \", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'filterable = ' in directory (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py\nLines 156-162:\n 156:     is_summary = False\n 157:     _output_field_resolved_to_none = False\n 158:     # Can the expression be used in a WHERE clause?\n 159:     filterable = True\n 160:     # Can the expression can be used as a source expression in Window?\n 161:     window_compatible = False\n 162: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py\nLines 1202-1208:\n1202:     # be introduced in the query as a result is not desired.\n1203:     contains_aggregate = False\n1204:     contains_over_clause = True\n1205:     filterable = False\n1206: \n1207:     def __init__(self, expression, partition_by=None, order_by=None, frame=None, output_field=None):\n1208:         self.partition_by = partition_by\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect! Now I can see that Django's internal expressions define `filterable` as a class attribute on `BaseExpression` classes. The issue is that the `check_filterable` method uses `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` which doesn't distinguish between Django's internal `filterable` attribute and user-defined model fields.\n\nLet me look at what types of objects should have the `filterable` attribute and how Django model instances are different.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"class BaseExpression\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'class BaseExpression' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py\nLines 149-155:\n 149: \n 150: \n 151: @deconstructible\n 152: class BaseExpression:\n 153:     \"\"\"Base class for all query expressions.\"\"\"\n 154: \n 155:     # aggregate specific fields\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug.

This is likely a naming conflict where Django's internal `filterable` attribute conflicts with the user's model field.\n\nLet me start by exploring the Django project structure to understand how it's organized, then locate the `check_filterable` method mentioned in the traceback.\n\n#TOOL_CALL explore_directory { \"dir_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nContents of /root/hy/projects_4/django:\n.editorconfig\n.eslintignore\n.eslintrc\n.gitattributes\n.github/\n.gitignore\n.hgignore\n.tx/\nAUTHORS\nCONTRIBUTING.rst\nGruntfile.js\nINSTALL\nLICENSE\nLICENSE.python\nMANIFEST.in\nREADME.rst\ndjango/\ndocs/\nextras/\njs_tests/\npackage.json\nscripts/\nsetup.cfg\nsetup.py\ntests/\ntox.ini\n\n\nAssistant: Now I can see this is a Django project. The bug is in the queryset filtering logic where a model with a `filterable` field causes a `NotSupportedError`. Let me look at the specific file mentioned in the traceback - the SQL query module where `check_filterable` is defined.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", \"start_line\": 1125, \"end_line\": 1140 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\nTotal lines: 2414\nShowing lines 1125-1140:\n\n1125:     def check_filterable(self, expression):\n1126:         \"\"\"Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause.\"\"\"\n1127:         if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n1128:             raise NotSupportedError(\n1129:                 expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '\n1130:                 'clause.'\n1131:             )\n1132:         if hasattr(expression, 'get_source_expressions'):\n1133:             for expr in expression.get_source_expressions():\n1134:                 self.check_filterable(expr)\n1135: \n1136:     def build_lookup(self, lookups, lhs, rhs):\n1137:         \"\"\"\n1138:         Try to extract transforms and lookup from given lhs.\n1139: \n1140:         The lhs value is something that works like SQLExpression.\n\n\nAssistant: Now I understand the bug! Looking at the `check_filterable` method, I can see the issue clearly:\n\n```python\ndef check_filterable(self, expression):\n    \"\"\"Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause.\"\"\"\n    if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n        raise NotSupportedError(\n            expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '\n            'clause.'\n        )\n```\n\nThe problem is that when a Django model instance has a field named `filterable`, Django's `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` call returns the value of that field instead of Django's internal `filterable` attribute. When the user's `filterable` field is `False` (as in the `ProductMetaDataType` model), Django incorrectly thinks the model instance is not filterable and raises the error.\n\nLet me look at the broader context around this method to understand how it's called and what the proper fix should be.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", \"start_line\": 1250, \"end_line\": 1280 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\nTotal lines: 2414\nShowing lines 1250-1280:\n\n1250:             clause = self.where_class()\n1251:             clause.add(condition, AND)\n1252:             return clause, []\n1253:         arg, value = filter_expr\n1254:         if not arg:\n1255:             raise FieldError(\"Cannot parse keyword query %r\" % arg)\n1256:         lookups, parts, reffed_expression = self.solve_lookup_type(arg)\n1257: \n1258:         if check_filterable:\n1259:             self.check_filterable(reffed_expression)\n1260: \n1261:         if not allow_joins and len(parts) > 1:\n1262:             raise FieldError(\"Joined field references are not permitted in this query\")\n1263: \n1264:         pre_joins = self.alias_refcount.copy()\n1265:         value = self.resolve_lookup_value(value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n1266:         used_joins = {k for k, v in self.alias_refcount.items() if v > pre_joins.get(k, 0)}\n1267: \n1268:         if check_filterable:\n1269:             self.check_filterable(value)\n1270: \n1271:         clause = self.where_class()\n1272:         if reffed_expression:\n1273:             condition = self.build_lookup(lookups, reffed_expression, value)\n1274:             clause.add(condition, AND)\n1275:             return clause, []\n1276: \n1277:         opts = self.get_meta()\n1278:         alias = self.get_initial_alias()\n1279:         allow_many = not branch_negated or not split_subq\n1280: \n\n\nAssistant: I can see the issue clearly now. Looking at line 1269 in the traceback, `self.check_filterable(value)` is being called where `value` is the `ProductMetaDataType` model instance. The problem is in the `check_filterable` method at line 1127:\n\n```python\nif not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n```\n\nWhen `expression` is a `ProductMetaDataType` instance with a `filterable` field set to `False`, `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` returns the value of the model's `filterable` field instead of Django's internal filterable attribute. Since the user's field is `False`, the condition becomes `if not False:` which is `True`, so it raises the `NotSupportedError`.\n\nThe fix needs to distinguish between Django's internal `filterable` attribute and user-defined model fields. Let me look at how Django's internal objects define their `filterable` attribute to understand the proper solution.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"filterable = \", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'filterable = ' in directory (showing first 2 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py\nLines 156-162:\n 156:     is_summary = False\n 157:     _output_field_resolved_to_none = False\n 158:     # Can the expression be used in a WHERE clause?\n 159:     filterable = True\n 160:     # Can the expression can be used as a source expression in Window?\n 161:     window_compatible = False\n 162: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py\nLines 1202-1208:\n1202:     # be introduced in the query as a result is not desired.\n1203:     contains_aggregate = False\n1204:     contains_over_clause = True\n1205:     filterable = False\n1206: \n1207:     def __init__(self, expression, partition_by=None, order_by=None, frame=None, output_field=None):\n1208:         self.partition_by = partition_by\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: Perfect! Now I can see that Django's internal expressions define `filterable` as a class attribute on `BaseExpression` classes. The issue is that the `check_filterable` method uses `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` which doesn't distinguish between Django's internal `filterable` attribute and user-defined model fields.\n\nLet me look at what types of objects should have the `filterable` attribute and how Django model instances are different.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"class BaseExpression\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'class BaseExpression' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py\nLines 149-155:\n 149: \n 150: \n 151: @deconstructible\n 152: class BaseExpression:\n 153:     \"\"\"Base class for all query expressions.\"\"\"\n 154: \n 155:     # aggregate specific fields\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: Now I have a complete understanding of the bug. The issue is that Django's `check_filterable` method incorrectly treats Django model instances with a user-defined `filterable` field as non-filterable expressions.\n\nLet me look at the Django model base class to understand how model instances differ from expressions:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"class Model\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/base.py\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'class Model' in file (showing first 4 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/base.py\nLines 69-75:\n  69:     return not inspect.isclass(value) and hasattr(value, 'contribute_to_class')\n  70: \n  71: \n  72: class ModelBase(type):\n  73:     \"\"\"Metaclass for all models.\"\"\"\n  74:     def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs, **kwargs):\n  75:         super_new = super().__new__\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/base.py\nLines 382-388:\n 382:         return cls._meta.default_manager\n 383: \n 384: \n 385: class ModelStateFieldsCacheDescriptor:\n 386:     def __get__(self, instance, cls=None):\n 387:         if instance is None:\n 388:             return self\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/base.py\nLines 390-396:\n 390:         return res\n 391: \n 392: \n 393: class ModelState:\n 394:     \"\"\"Store model instance state.\"\"\"\n 395:     db = None\n 396:     # If true, uniqueness validation checks will consider this a new, unsaved\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/base.py\nLines 401-407:\n 401:     fields_cache = ModelStateFieldsCacheDescriptor()\n 402: \n 403: \n 404: class Model(metaclass=ModelBase):\n 405: \n 406:     def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n 407:         # Alias some things as locals to avoid repeat global lookups\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: Perfect! Now I have all the context I need. The bug is clear:\n\n1. The `check_filterable` method in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py` at lines 1125-1134 is incorrectly checking model instances for a `filterable` attribute\n2. When a Django model has a user-defined field named `filterable` (like the `ProductMetaDataType.filterable` BooleanField), `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` returns the value of that field instead of Django's internal filterable attribute\n3. Since `ProductMetaDataType.filterable` is `False`, the check fails and raises `NotSupportedError`\n\nThe fix is to ensure that `check_filterable` only applies to Django query expressions (which inherit from `BaseExpression`) and not to model instances. Let me check if model instances should be considered filterable by looking at similar patterns in Django's codebase.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"isinstance.*BaseExpression\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'isinstance.*BaseExpression' in directory '/root/hy/projects_4/django/django'\n\nAssistant: Now I have complete understanding of the bug. The issue is in the `check_filterable` method which incorrectly assumes that any object with a `filterable` attribute that evaluates to `False` should not be allowed in filter clauses. However, this conflicts with user-defined model fields named `filterable`.\n\nLet me check what types of objects the `check_filterable` method is actually meant to validate by looking at Django's expression system:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"filterable = False\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'filterable = False' in directory (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py\nLines 1202-1208:\n1202:     # be introduced in the query as a result is not desired.\n1203:     contains_aggregate = False\n1204:     contains_over_clause = True\n1205:     filterable = False\n1206: \n1207:     def __init__(self, expression, partition_by=None, order_by=None, frame=None, output_field=None):\n1208:         self.partition_by = partition_by\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that includes:\n1.

If the user's field value is `False`, Django incorrectly treats the model instance as non-filterable and raises the error.\n\n### Technical Context Discovered\n\n1. **Django's Internal System**: Django query expressions (inheriting from `BaseExpression` in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py`) have a class attribute `filterable = True` by default, with some exceptions like Window expressions setting `filterable = False`.\n\n2. **Error Location**: The bug is triggered at line 1269 in the same file where `self.check_filterable(value)` is called during query building, with `value` being the model instance.\n\n3. **Naming Conflict**: The issue is a naming conflict between Django's internal `filterable` attribute (meant for query expressions) and user-defined model fields with the same name.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n1. **Project Structure Analysis**: Explored the Django project directory structure to understand the codebase organization\n2. **Source Code Investigation**: Examined the specific file and method mentioned in the error traceback\n3. **Context Research**: Investigated Django's expression system to understand the intended use of the `filterable` attribute\n4. **Pattern Analysis**: Searched for how `filterable` is used throughout Django's codebase\n\n## Tools Used\n\n- `explore_directory`: To understand Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: To examine specific code sections in the query.py file\n- `search_code_with_context`: To find patterns of `filterable` usage across the codebase\n\n## Current Status\n\n**Analysis Complete** - The bug has been fully identified and understood. The root cause is clear and the solution approach is determined.\n\n## Required Solution\n\nThe `check_filterable` method needs to be modified to distinguish between:\n- Django query expressions (which should be checked for the `filterable` attribute)\n- Django model instances (which should always be considered filterable regardless of user-defined fields)\n\nThe fix should ensure that only objects that are actually query expressions (likely inheriting from `BaseExpression`) are subject to the filterable check, while model instances should be allowed regardless of any user-defined `filterable` field.\n\n## Next Steps Needed\n\n1.

Since `ProductMetaDataType.filterable` is `False`, the check fails and raises `NotSupportedError`\n\nThe fix is to ensure that `check_filterable` only applies to Django query expressions (which inherit from `BaseExpression`) and not to model instances.

However, it's incorrectly being applied to ALL objects, including Django model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\n\n3. When `ProductMetaDataType` instance has `filterable = models.BooleanField(default=False)`, the `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` returns `False` from the model field, causing the method to incorrectly reject the model instance.\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `check_filterable` method should only apply to Django query expressions (objects that inherit from `BaseExpression`), not to model instances. Model instances should always be considered filterable in filter clauses.\n\n**Location to Fix:**\nLines 1125-1134 in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py` - the `check_filterable` method needs to be modified to check if the object is actually a query expression before applying the filterable check.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is in the `check_filterable` method at lines 1125-1134 in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py`. This method incorrectly applies filterable checks to Django model instances when it should only check Django query expressions (like Window expressions). The fix is to modify the method to only perform the filterable check on actual query expressions, not on model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nQueryset raises NotSupportedError when RHS has filterable=False attribute.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Nicolas Baccelli)\n\t \nI'm migrating my app to django 3.0.7 and I hit a strange behavior using a model class with a field labeled filterable\nclass ProductMetaDataType(models.Model):\n\tlabel = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True, blank=False, null=False)\n\tfilterable = models.BooleanField(default=False, verbose_name=_(\"filterable\"))\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tapp_label = \"adminpricing\"\n\t\tverbose_name = _(\"product meta data type\")\n\t\tverbose_name_plural = _(\"product meta data types\")\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.label\nclass ProductMetaData(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\tproduct = models.ForeignKey(\n\t\tProduit, null=False, blank=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE\n\t)\n\tvalue = models.TextField(null=False, blank=False)\n\tmarketplace = models.ForeignKey(\n\t\tPlateforme, null=False, blank=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE\n\t)\n\tdate_created = models.DateTimeField(null=True, default=timezone.now)\n\tmetadata_type = models.ForeignKey(\n\t\tProductMetaDataType, null=False, blank=False, on_delete=models.CASCADE\n\t)\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tapp_label = \"adminpricing\"\n\t\tverbose_name = _(\"product meta data\")\n\t\tverbose_name_plural = _(\"product meta datas\")\nError happened when filtering ProductMetaData with a metadata_type :\nProductMetaData.objects.filter(value=\"Dark Vador\", metadata_type=self.brand_metadata)\nError traceback :\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"/backoffice/backoffice/adminpricing/tests/test_pw.py\", line 481, in test_checkpolicywarning_by_fields\n\tfor p in ProductMetaData.objects.filter(\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/manager.py\", line 82, in manager_method\n\treturn getattr(self.get_queryset(), name)(*args, **kwargs)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/query.py\", line 904, in filter\n\treturn self._filter_or_exclude(False, *args, **kwargs)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/query.py\", line 923, in _filter_or_exclude\n\tclone.query.add_q(Q(*args, **kwargs))\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", line 1351, in add_q\n\tclause, _ = self._add_q(q_object, self.used_aliases)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", line 1378, in _add_q\n\tchild_clause, needed_inner = self.build_filter(\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", line 1264, in build_filter\n\tself.check_filterable(value)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", line 1131, in check_filterable\n\traise NotSupportedError(\ndjango.db.utils.NotSupportedError: ProductMetaDataType is disallowed in the filter clause.\nI changed label to filterable_test and it fixed this issue\nThis should be documented or fix.\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Bug Analysis and Repair Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nFix a bug in Django's ORM where models with a field named `filterable` cause a `NotSupportedError` when used as foreign key values in filter queries.\n\n## Bug Analysis Results\n\n### Root Cause Identified\nThe bug is located in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py` in the `check_filterable` method (lines 1125-1134):\n\n```python\ndef check_filterable(self, expression):\n    \"\"\"Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause.\"\"\"\n    if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n        raise NotSupportedError(\n            expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '\n            'clause.'\n        )\n```\n\n**The Problem**: When a Django model instance has a user-defined field named `filterable` (like `ProductMetaDataType.filterable = BooleanField()`), the `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` call returns the value of that model field instead of Django's internal `filterable` attribute. If the user's field value is `False`, Django incorrectly treats the model instance as non-filterable and raises the error.\n\n### Technical Context Discovered\n\n1. **Django's Internal System**: Django query expressions (inheriting from `BaseExpression` in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py`) have a class attribute `filterable = True` by default, with some exceptions like Window expressions setting `filterable = False`.\n\n2. **Error Location**: The bug is triggered at line 1269 in the same file where `self.check_filterable(value)` is called during query building, with `value` being the model instance.\n\n3. **Naming Conflict**: The issue is a naming conflict between Django's internal `filterable` attribute (meant for query expressions) and user-defined model fields with the same name.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n1. **Project Structure Analysis**: Explored the Django project directory structure to understand the codebase organization\n2. **Source Code Investigation**: Examined the specific file and method mentioned in the error traceback\n3. **Context Research**: Investigated Django's expression system to understand the intended use of the `filterable` attribute\n4. **Pattern Analysis**: Searched for how `filterable` is used throughout Django's codebase\n\n## Tools Used\n\n- `explore_directory`: To understand Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: To examine specific code sections in the query.py file\n- `search_code_with_context`: To find patterns of `filterable` usage across the codebase\n\n## Current Status\n\n**Analysis Complete** - The bug has been fully identified and understood. The root cause is clear and the solution approach is determined.\n\n## Required Solution\n\nThe `check_filterable` method needs to be modified to distinguish between:\n- Django query expressions (which should be checked for the `filterable` attribute)\n- Django model instances (which should always be considered filterable regardless of user-defined fields)\n\nThe fix should ensure that only objects that are actually query expressions (likely inheriting from `BaseExpression`) are subject to the filterable check, while model instances should be allowed regardless of any user-defined `filterable` field.\n\n## Next Steps Needed\n\n1. Implement the fix in the `check_filterable` method to properly distinguish between Django expressions and model instances\n2. Test the fix with the problematic scenario (model with `filterable` field)\n3. Ensure no regression in existing functionality where the filterable check is legitimately needed\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\nStart line: 1125\nEnd line: 1134\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nPerfect! Now I have all the context I need. The bug is clear:\n\n1. The `check_filterable` method in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py` at lines 1125-1134 is incorrectly checking model instances for a `filterable` attribute\n2. When a Django model has a user-defined field named `filterable` (like the `ProductMetaDataType.filterable` BooleanField), `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` returns the value of that field instead of Django's internal filterable attribute\n3. Since `ProductMetaDataType.filterable` is `False`, the check fails and raises `NotSupportedError`\n\nThe fix is to ensure that `check_filterable` only applies to Django query expressions (which inherit from `BaseExpression`) and not to model instances. Let me check if model instances should be considered filterable by looking at similar patterns in Django's codebase.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"isinstance.*BaseExpression\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'isinstance.*BaseExpression' in directory '/root/hy/projects_4/django/django'\nNow I have complete understanding of the bug. The issue is in the `check_filterable` method which incorrectly assumes that any object with a `filterable` attribute that evaluates to `False` should not be allowed in filter clauses. However, this conflicts with user-defined model fields named `filterable`.\n\nLet me check what types of objects the `check_filterable` method is actually meant to validate by looking at Django's expression system:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"filterable = False\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'filterable = False' in directory (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py\nLines 1202-1208:\n1202:     # be introduced in the query as a result is not desired.\n1203:     contains_aggregate = False\n1204:     contains_over_clause = True\n1205:     filterable = False\n1206: \n1207:     def __init__(self, expression, partition_by=None, order_by=None, frame=None, output_field=None):\n1208:         self.partition_by = partition_by\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect! Now I have a complete understanding. The issue is that Django's `check_filterable` method is designed to prevent certain query expressions (like Window expressions) from being used in WHERE clauses, but it's incorrectly being applied to model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\n\nFrom the search result, I can see that Window expressions set `filterable = False` to prevent their use in filter clauses.

If the user's field value is `False`, Django incorrectly treats the model instance as non-filterable and raises the error.\n\n### Technical Context Discovered\n\n1. **Django's Internal System**: Django query expressions (inheriting from `BaseExpression` in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py`) have a class attribute `filterable = True` by default, with some exceptions like Window expressions setting `filterable = False`.\n\n2. **Error Location**: The bug is triggered at line 1269 in the same file where `self.check_filterable(value)` is called during query building, with `value` being the model instance.\n\n3. **Naming Conflict**: The issue is a naming conflict between Django's internal `filterable` attribute (meant for query expressions) and user-defined model fields with the same name.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n1. **Project Structure Analysis**: Explored the Django project directory structure to understand the codebase organization\n2. **Source Code Investigation**: Examined the specific file and method mentioned in the error traceback\n3. **Context Research**: Investigated Django's expression system to understand the intended use of the `filterable` attribute\n4. **Pattern Analysis**: Searched for how `filterable` is used throughout Django's codebase\n\n## Tools Used\n\n- `explore_directory`: To understand Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: To examine specific code sections in the query.py file\n- `search_code_with_context`: To find patterns of `filterable` usage across the codebase\n\n## Current Status\n\n**Analysis Complete** - The bug has been fully identified and understood. The root cause is clear and the solution approach is determined.\n\n## Required Solution\n\nThe `check_filterable` method needs to be modified to distinguish between:\n- Django query expressions (which should be checked for the `filterable` attribute)\n- Django model instances (which should always be considered filterable regardless of user-defined fields)\n\nThe fix should ensure that only objects that are actually query expressions (likely inheriting from `BaseExpression`) are subject to the filterable check, while model instances should be allowed regardless of any user-defined `filterable` field.\n\n## Next Steps Needed\n\n1. Implement the fix in the `check_filterable` method to properly distinguish between Django expressions and model instances\n2. Test the fix with the problematic scenario (model with `filterable` field)\n3. Ensure no regression in existing functionality where the filterable check is legitimately needed\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\nStart line: 1125\nEnd line: 1134\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on the complete analysis of the bug, I can now provide the precise repair suggestion for the identified location:\n\n**Bug Location Analysis:**\nThe issue is in the `check_filterable` method at lines 1125-1134 in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py`. This method is designed to prevent certain Django query expressions (like Window expressions with `filterable = False`) from being used in WHERE clauses, but it incorrectly applies this check to Django model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nWhen `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` is called on a `ProductMetaDataType` model instance, it returns the value of the user's `filterable` BooleanField (which is `False`) instead of Django's internal `filterable` attribute meant for query expressions. This causes Django to incorrectly reject valid model instances from filter queries.\n\n**S**\n\n1. **Location: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py, lines 1125-1134**: \n   \n   Modify the `check_filterable` method to only apply the filterable check to Django query expressions, not to model instances. The fix should:\n   \n   ```python\n   def check_filterable(self, expression):\n       \"\"\"Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause.\"\"\"\n       # Only check filterable attribute for query expressions, not model instances\n       from django.db.models.expressions import BaseExpression\n       if isinstance(expression, BaseExpression) and not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n           raise NotSupportedError(\n               expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '\n               'clause.'\n           )\n   ```\n   \n   **Rationale**: This change ensures that:\n   - Django query expressions (like Window expressions) are still properly validated for the `filterable` attribute\n   - Django model instances are always considered filterable in WHERE clauses, regardless of any user-defined fields named `filterable`\n   - The original intent of preventing non-filterable expressions in queries is preserved\n   - No breaking changes to existing functionality since model instances were never intended to be filtered out by this check\n\nThis single change resolves the naming conflict between Django's internal `filterable` attribute system and user-defined model fields, allowing models to safely use `filterable` as a field name without breaking ORM queries.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nPerfect! Now I have all the context I need. The bug is clear:\n\n1. The `check_filterable` method in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py` at lines 1125-1134 is incorrectly checking model instances for a `filterable` attribute\n2. When a Django model has a user-defined field named `filterable` (like the `ProductMetaDataType.filterable` BooleanField), `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` returns the value of that field instead of Django's internal filterable attribute\n3. Since `ProductMetaDataType.filterable` is `False`, the check fails and raises `NotSupportedError`\n\nThe fix is to ensure that `check_filterable` only applies to Django query expressions (which inherit from `BaseExpression`) and not to model instances. Let me check if model instances should be considered filterable by looking at similar patterns in Django's codebase.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"isinstance.*BaseExpression\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'isinstance.*BaseExpression' in directory '/root/hy/projects_4/django/django'\nNow I have complete understanding of the bug. The issue is in the `check_filterable` method which incorrectly assumes that any object with a `filterable` attribute that evaluates to `False` should not be allowed in filter clauses. However, this conflicts with user-defined model fields named `filterable`.\n\nLet me check what types of objects the `check_filterable` method is actually meant to validate by looking at Django's expression system:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"filterable = False\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'filterable = False' in directory (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py\nLines 1202-1208:\n1202:     # be introduced in the query as a result is not desired.\n1203:     contains_aggregate = False\n1204:     contains_over_clause = True\n1205:     filterable = False\n1206: \n1207:     def __init__(self, expression, partition_by=None, order_by=None, frame=None, output_field=None):\n1208:         self.partition_by = partition_by\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect! Now I have a complete understanding. The issue is that Django's `check_filterable` method is designed to prevent certain query expressions (like Window expressions) from being used in WHERE clauses, but it's incorrectly being applied to model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\n\nFrom the search result, I can see that Window expressions set `filterable = False` to prevent their use in filter clauses. However, the `check_filterable` method is too broad - it checks ANY object's `filterable` attribute, including model instances.\n\nLet me examine the context where `check_filterable` is called to understand what types of objects should actually be filtered:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", \"start_line\": 1260, \"end_line\": 1275 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\nTotal lines: 2414\nShowing lines 1260-1275:\n\n1260: \n1261:         if not allow_joins and len(parts) > 1:\n1262:             raise FieldError(\"Joined field references are not permitted in this query\")\n1263: \n1264:         pre_joins = self.alias_refcount.copy()\n1265:         value = self.resolve_lookup_value(value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n1266:         used_joins = {k for k, v in self.alias_refcount.items() if v > pre_joins.get(k, 0)}\n1267: \n1268:         if check_filterable:\n1269:             self.check_filterable(value)\n1270: \n1271:         clause = self.where_class()\n1272:         if reffed_expression:\n1273:             condition = self.build_lookup(lookups, reffed_expression, value)\n1274:             clause.add(condition, AND)\n1275:             return clause, []\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have complete understanding of the bug and the fix needed:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. The `check_filterable` method at lines 1125-1134 in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py` is meant to prevent certain Django query expressions (like Window expressions with `filterable = False`) from being used in WHERE clauses.\n\n2. However, it's incorrectly being applied to ALL objects, including Django model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\n\n3. When `ProductMetaDataType` instance has `filterable = models.BooleanField(default=False)`, the `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` returns `False` from the model field, causing the method to incorrectly reject the model instance.\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `check_filterable` method should only apply to Django query expressions (objects that inherit from `BaseExpression`), not to model instances. Model instances should always be considered filterable in filter clauses.\n\n**Location to Fix:**\nLines 1125-1134 in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py` - the `check_filterable` method needs to be modified to check if the object is actually a query expression before applying the filterable check.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is in the `check_filterable` method at lines 1125-1134 in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py`. This method incorrectly applies filterable checks to Django model instances when it should only check Django query expressions (like Window expressions). The fix is to modify the method to only perform the filterable check on actual query expressions, not on model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis, I have identified the root cause of the bug. The issue is in the `check_filterable` method in Django's query building system. When a Django model has a user-defined field named `filterable` (like `ProductMetaDataType.filterable = BooleanField(default=False)`), the method incorrectly treats the model instance as non-filterable because it reads the value of that field instead of Django's internal `filterable` attribute meant for query expressions.\n\nThe bug occurs because:\n1. Django query expressions (like Window expressions) have a `filterable = False` class attribute to prevent their use in WHERE clauses\n2. The `check_filterable` method uses `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` to check this\n3. When applied to model instances with a user-defined `filterable` field, it reads the field value instead of the intended class attribute\n4. Since `ProductMetaDataType.filterable` field has `default=False`, the check fails and raises `NotSupportedError`\n\nThe fix needs to ensure that `check_filterable` only applies to Django query expressions, not to model instances.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1125,\n            \"end_line\": 1134\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the complete analysis of the bug, I can now provide the precise repair suggestion for the identified location:\n\n**Bug Location Analysis:**\nThe issue is in the `check_filterable` method at lines 1125-1134 in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py`.

Now I have all the context I need. The bug is clear:\n\n1. The `check_filterable` method in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py` at lines 1125-1134 is incorrectly checking model instances for a `filterable` attribute\n2. When a Django model has a user-defined field named `filterable` (like the `ProductMetaDataType.filterable` BooleanField), `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` returns the value of that field instead of Django's internal filterable attribute\n3. Since `ProductMetaDataType.filterable` is `False`, the check fails and raises `NotSupportedError`\n\nThe fix is to ensure that `check_filterable` only applies to Django query expressions (which inherit from `BaseExpression`) and not to model instances. Let me check if model instances should be considered filterable by looking at similar patterns in Django's codebase.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"isinstance.*BaseExpression\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'isinstance.*BaseExpression' in directory '/root/hy/projects_4/django/django'\nNow I have complete understanding of the bug. The issue is in the `check_filterable` method which incorrectly assumes that any object with a `filterable` attribute that evaluates to `False` should not be allowed in filter clauses. However, this conflicts with user-defined model fields named `filterable`.\n\nLet me check what types of objects the `check_filterable` method is actually meant to validate by looking at Django's expression system:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"filterable = False\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'filterable = False' in directory (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/expressions.py\nLines 1202-1208:\n1202:     # be introduced in the query as a result is not desired.\n1203:     contains_aggregate = False\n1204:     contains_over_clause = True\n1205:     filterable = False\n1206: \n1207:     def __init__(self, expression, partition_by=None, order_by=None, frame=None, output_field=None):\n1208:         self.partition_by = partition_by\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nPerfect! Now I have a complete understanding. The issue is that Django's `check_filterable` method is designed to prevent certain query expressions (like Window expressions) from being used in WHERE clauses, but it's incorrectly being applied to model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\n\nFrom the search result, I can see that Window expressions set `filterable = False` to prevent their use in filter clauses. However, the `check_filterable` method is too broad - it checks ANY object's `filterable` attribute, including model instances.\n\nLet me examine the context where `check_filterable` is called to understand what types of objects should actually be filtered:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", \"start_line\": 1260, \"end_line\": 1275 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\nTotal lines: 2414\nShowing lines 1260-1275:\n\n1260: \n1261:         if not allow_joins and len(parts) > 1:\n1262:             raise FieldError(\"Joined field references are not permitted in this query\")\n1263: \n1264:         pre_joins = self.alias_refcount.copy()\n1265:         value = self.resolve_lookup_value(value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n1266:         used_joins = {k for k, v in self.alias_refcount.items() if v > pre_joins.get(k, 0)}\n1267: \n1268:         if check_filterable:\n1269:             self.check_filterable(value)\n1270: \n1271:         clause = self.where_class()\n1272:         if reffed_expression:\n1273:             condition = self.build_lookup(lookups, reffed_expression, value)\n1274:             clause.add(condition, AND)\n1275:             return clause, []\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I have complete understanding of the bug and the fix needed:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. The `check_filterable` method at lines 1125-1134 in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py` is meant to prevent certain Django query expressions (like Window expressions with `filterable = False`) from being used in WHERE clauses.\n\n2. However, it's incorrectly being applied to ALL objects, including Django model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\n\n3. When `ProductMetaDataType` instance has `filterable = models.BooleanField(default=False)`, the `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` returns `False` from the model field, causing the method to incorrectly reject the model instance.\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `check_filterable` method should only apply to Django query expressions (objects that inherit from `BaseExpression`), not to model instances. Model instances should always be considered filterable in filter clauses.\n\n**Location to Fix:**\nLines 1125-1134 in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py` - the `check_filterable` method needs to be modified to check if the object is actually a query expression before applying the filterable check.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is in the `check_filterable` method at lines 1125-1134 in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py`. This method incorrectly applies filterable checks to Django model instances when it should only check Django query expressions (like Window expressions). The fix is to modify the method to only perform the filterable check on actual query expressions, not on model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis, I have identified the root cause of the bug. The issue is in the `check_filterable` method in Django's query building system. When a Django model has a user-defined field named `filterable` (like `ProductMetaDataType.filterable = BooleanField(default=False)`), the method incorrectly treats the model instance as non-filterable because it reads the value of that field instead of Django's internal `filterable` attribute meant for query expressions.\n\nThe bug occurs because:\n1. Django query expressions (like Window expressions) have a `filterable = False` class attribute to prevent their use in WHERE clauses\n2. The `check_filterable` method uses `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` to check this\n3. When applied to model instances with a user-defined `filterable` field, it reads the field value instead of the intended class attribute\n4. Since `ProductMetaDataType.filterable` field has `default=False`, the check fails and raises `NotSupportedError`\n\nThe fix needs to ensure that `check_filterable` only applies to Django query expressions, not to model instances.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1125,\n            \"end_line\": 1134\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the complete analysis of the bug, I can now provide the precise repair suggestion for the identified location:\n\n**Bug Location Analysis:**\nThe issue is in the `check_filterable` method at lines 1125-1134 in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py`.

The `check_filterable` method is calling `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` on line 1127, which will return the value of the `filterable` BooleanField from the `ProductMetaDataType` model instance (which is `False` by default). This causes the check to fail and raise the `NotSupportedError`.\n\nThe current code doesn't distinguish between:\n1. Django query expressions (like Window expressions) that should have their `filterable` class attribute checked\n2. Django model instances that should always be allowed in filter clauses regardless of any user-defined fields\n\nThe suggestion to add `isinstance(expression, BaseExpression)` check is correct - it will ensure that only actual query expressions are subject to the filterable check, while model instances will always be allowed.\n\nThe code segment shows the complete method including the recursive call to `check_filterable` for source expressions, which is good - the fix needs to preserve this functionality.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe location is ready for fixing.

This preserves the original intent of preventing non-filterable expressions (like Window expressions) from being used in WHERE clauses while allowing models to safely use `filterable` as a field name.\n\nThe recursive call to `check_filterable` for source expressions will also be preserved, maintaining the existing functionality for complex expressions.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py lines 1125-1134\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import copy\n  import difflib\n  import functools\n  import inspect\n  import sys\n  import warnings\n  from collections import Counter, namedtuple\n  from collections.abc import Iterator, Mapping\n  from itertools import chain, count, product\n  from string import ascii_uppercase\n  from django.core.exceptions import (\n  from django.db import DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS, NotSupportedError, connections\n  from django.db.models.aggregates import Count\n  from django.db.models.constants import LOOKUP_SEP\n  from django.db.models.expressions import BaseExpression, Col, F, OuterRef, Ref\n  from django.db.models.fields import Field\n  from django.db.models.fields.related_lookups import MultiColSource\n  from django.db.models.lookups import Lookup\n  from django.db.models.query_utils import (\n  from django.db.models.sql.constants import INNER, LOUTER, ORDER_DIR, SINGLE\n  from django.db.models.sql.datastructures import (\n  from django.db.models.sql.where import (\n  from django.utils.deprecation import RemovedInDjango40Warning\n  from django.utils.functional import cached_property\n  from django.utils.tree import Node\n  from django.db.models.sql.subqueries import AggregateQuery\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C] 1115:                 raise ValueError(\n[C] 1116:                     'Cannot use QuerySet for \"%s\": Use a QuerySet for \"%s\".' %\n[C] 1117:                     (value.model._meta.object_name, opts.object_name)\n[C] 1118:                 )\n[C] 1119:             elif hasattr(value, '_meta'):\n[C] 1120:                 self.check_query_object_type(value, opts, field)\n[C] 1121:             elif hasattr(value, '__iter__'):\n[C] 1122:                 for v in value:\n[C] 1123:                     self.check_query_object_type(v, opts, field)\n[C] 1124: \n[R] 1125:     def check_filterable(self, expression):\n[R] 1126:         \"\"\"Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause.\"\"\"\n[R] 1127:         if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n[R] 1128:             raise NotSupportedError(\n[R] 1129:                 expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '\n[R] 1130:                 'clause.'\n[R] 1131:             )\n[R] 1132:         if hasattr(expression, 'get_source_expressions'):\n[R] 1133:             for expr in expression.get_source_expressions():\n[R] 1134:                 self.check_filterable(expr)\n[C] 1135: \n[C] 1136:     def build_lookup(self, lookups, lhs, rhs):\n[C] 1137:         \"\"\"\n[C] 1138:         Try to extract transforms and lookup from given lhs.\n[C] 1139: \n[C] 1140:         The lhs value is something that works like SQLExpression.\n[C] 1141:         The rhs value is what the lookup is going to compare against.\n[C] 1142:         The lookups is a list of names to extract using get_lookup()\n[C] 1143:         and get_transform().\n[C] 1144:         \"\"\"\n\nYou must pay close attention to **indentation** — especially the relative indentation level between the patch and its parent scope (for example, the containing class or function).\n⚠️ **Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n⚠️ **Do not combine fixes for different locations into one block** — every location's fix should be in a **separate** ```python```code block.\n\nHere are the suggestions from the Suggester:\nS\n\nBased on the complete analysis of the bug, I can now provide the precise repair suggestion for the identified location:\n\n**Bug Location Analysis:**\nThe issue is in the `check_filterable` method at lines 1125-1134 in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py`.

This method is designed to prevent certain Django query expressions (like Window expressions with `filterable = False`) from being used in WHERE clauses, but it incorrectly applies this check to Django model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nWhen `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` is called on a `ProductMetaDataType` model instance, it returns the value of the user's `filterable` BooleanField (which is `False`) instead of Django's internal `filterable` attribute meant for query expressions. This causes Django to incorrectly reject valid model instances from filter queries.\n\n**S**\n\n1. **Location: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py, lines 1125-1134**: \n   \n   Modify the `check_filterable` method to only apply the filterable check to Django query expressions, not to model instances. The fix should:\n   \n   ```python\n   def check_filterable(self, expression):\n       \"\"\"Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause.\"\"\"\n       # Only check filterable attribute for query expressions, not model instances\n       from django.db.models.expressions import BaseExpression\n       if isinstance(expression, BaseExpression) and not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n           raise NotSupportedError(\n               expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '\n               'clause.'\n           )\n   ```\n   \n   **Rationale**: This change ensures that:\n   - Django query expressions (like Window expressions) are still properly validated for the `filterable` attribute\n   - Django model instances are always considered filterable in WHERE clauses, regardless of any user-defined fields named `filterable`\n   - The original intent of preventing non-filterable expressions in queries is preserved\n   - No breaking changes to existing functionality since model instances were never intended to be filtered out by this check\n\nThis single change resolves the naming conflict between Django's internal `filterable` attribute system and user-defined model fields, allowing models to safely use `filterable` as a field name without breaking ORM queries.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

This method is designed to prevent certain Django query expressions (like Window expressions with `filterable = False`) from being used in WHERE clauses, but it incorrectly applies this check to Django model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nWhen `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` is called on a `ProductMetaDataType` model instance, it returns the value of the user's `filterable` BooleanField (which is `False`) instead of Django's internal `filterable` attribute meant for query expressions. This causes Django to incorrectly reject valid model instances from filter queries.\n\n**S**\n\n1. **Location: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py, lines 1125-1134**: \n   \n   Modify the `check_filterable` method to only apply the filterable check to Django query expressions, not to model instances.

This method is designed to prevent certain Django query expressions (like Window expressions with `filterable = False`) from being used in WHERE clauses, but it incorrectly applies this check to Django model instances that happen to have a user-defined field named `filterable`.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nWhen `getattr(expression, 'filterable', True)` is called on a `ProductMetaDataType` model instance, it returns the value of the user's `filterable` BooleanField (which is `False`) instead of Django's internal `filterable` attribute meant for query expressions. This causes Django to incorrectly reject valid model instances from filter queries.\n\n**S**\n\n1. **Location: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/db/models/sql/query.py, lines 1125-1134**: \n   \n   Modify the `check_filterable` method to only apply the filterable check to Django query expressions, not to model instances.
