    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug clearly. The issue is in the `_multi_decorate` function in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py`. \n\nThe problem occurs at line 40 where `bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))` creates a partial object. When decorators try to access function attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc. on this partial object, they fail because partial objects don't have these attributes.\n\nThe current `_update_method_wrapper` function tries to work around this by applying the decorator to a dummy function and copying attributes, but this doesn't solve the core issue - the decorator itself receives a partial object that lacks the expected function attributes.\n\nI need to look at the exact lines where the bug occurs and understand how to fix it. The fix should ensure that when decorators are applied to the `bound_method`, they receive an object that has the necessary function attributes.\n\nLet me examine the `_multi_decorate` function more closely to identify the exact location of the bug.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py\", \"start_line\": 35, \"end_line\": 50 }",

The problem is in the `_multi_decorate` function. When a decorator tries to access `func.__name__` (or other function attributes), it fails because `bound_method` is a `partial` object, not a regular function. Let me examine the `_update_method_wrapper` function more closely:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py\", \"start_line\": 13, \"end_line\": 20 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py\nTotal lines: 179\nShowing lines 13-20:\n\n  13: def _update_method_wrapper(_wrapper, decorator):\n  14:     # _multi_decorate()'s bound_method isn't available in this scope.

The issue is in the `_multi_decorate` function in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py`. \n\nThe problem occurs at line 40 where `bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))` creates a partial object.

The problem is in the `_multi_decorate` function. When a decorator tries to access `func.__name__` (or other function attributes), it fails because `bound_method` is a `partial` object, not a regular function. Let me examine the `_update_method_wrapper` function more closely:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py\", \"start_line\": 13, \"end_line\": 20 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py\nTotal lines: 179\nShowing lines 13-20:\n\n  13: def _update_method_wrapper(_wrapper, decorator):\n  14:     # _multi_decorate()'s bound_method isn't available in this scope.

The issue is in the `_multi_decorate` function in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py`. \n\nThe problem occurs at line 40 where `bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))` creates a partial object. When decorators try to access function attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc. on this partial object, they fail because partial objects don't have these attributes.\n\nThe current `_update_method_wrapper` function tries to work around this by applying the decorator to a dummy function and copying attributes, but this doesn't solve the core issue - the decorator itself receives a partial object that lacks the expected function attributes.\n\nI need to look at the exact lines where the bug occurs and understand how to fix it.

Now I have a complete understanding of the bug. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n## Bug Analysis\n\n**Location**: `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py`, lines 40-42\n\n**Root Cause**: In the `_multi_decorate` function, at line 40:\n```python\nbound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))\n```\n\nThe `partial` object created here lacks function attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, `__doc__`, etc. When decorators (like the `logger` decorator in the problem statement) try to access `func.__name__` on line 42 during `bound_method = dec(bound_method)`, they fail because partial objects don't have these attributes.\n\n**The Problem Flow**:\n1. Line 40: Creates a `partial` object without function attributes\n2. Line 42: Applies decorators to this partial object\n3. **BUG**: Decorators expecting `__name__`, `__module__`, etc. fail on the partial object\n\n**Current Workaround Limitation**: \nLines 46-47 try to fix this by using `_update_method_wrapper`, but this only helps *after* the decorators have been applied. The decorators themselves still receive a partial object that lacks the necessary attributes.\n\n## Bug Locations\n\nBased on my analysis, here are the precise locations where the bug manifests:\n\n1. **Primary Bug Location**: Lines 40-42 in `_multi_decorate` function where the partial object is created and decorators are applied to it\n2. **Insufficient Workaround**: Lines 46-47 where `_update_method_wrapper` is called but doesn't solve the core issue\n3. **Helper Function Context**: Lines 13-20 where `_update_method_wrapper` is defined but only works post-decoration\n\nThe fix needs to ensure that when decorators are applied on line 42, they receive an object that has the necessary function attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc., instead of a bare partial object.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django `method_decorator` bug, I have identified the precise locations where the issue occurs. The root cause is that decorators receive a `partial` object instead of a proper function object with the expected attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 40,\n            \"end_line\": 42\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 13,\n            \"end_line\": 20\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 46,\n            \"end_line\": 47\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Location 1 (lines 40-42)**: The primary bug location where `partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))` creates a partial object lacking function attributes, and decorators are applied to this deficient object.\n\n**Location 2 (lines 13-20)**: The `_update_method_wrapper` helper function that attempts to work around the issue but only operates after decoration, not during the critical decoration phase.\n\n**Location 3 (lines 46-47)**: Where the insufficient workaround is applied - this fixes wrapper attributes after decoration but doesn't help decorators that need to access function attributes during the decoration process itself.\n#REFLECT\nPerfect! Now I have the complete picture. The problem statement confirms exactly what I identified in my analysis. The issue is that when a decorator like `logger` tries to access `func.__name__` during the decoration process, it receives a `functools.partial` object instead of a proper function object.\n\nThe bug occurs in the `_multi_decorate` function where:\n1. Line 40 creates `bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))`\n2. Line 42 applies decorators: `bound_method = dec(bound_method)`\n3. The decorator (`logger` in this case) tries to access `func.__name__` but fails because `func` is a partial object\n\nThe three suspicious locations I identified are interconnected:\n- Location 1 (lines 40-42): Where the partial object is created and decorators fail\n- Location 2 (lines 13-20): The helper function that tries to fix attributes but only works post-decoration\n- Location 3 (lines 46-47): Where the insufficient workaround is applied\n\nNow I need to propose coordinated fixes for all three locations that work together to solve the problem.\n\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **[Lines 40-42]**: Replace the partial object with a proper wrapper function that has the necessary function attributes before applying decorators. Create a closure function that:\n   - Has `__name__`, `__module__`, `__doc__` and other attributes copied from the original method\n   - Maintains the same signature (no `self` parameter) \n   - Still captures `self` in its closure for method calling\n   - Can be decorated normally without AttributeError\n\n2. **[Lines 13-20]**: Modify `_update_method_wrapper()` to work with the new approach. Since we'll be providing proper function objects to decorators, this function should focus on copying any additional attributes that decorators might add, rather than trying to work around the partial object limitation.\n\n3. **[Lines 46-47]**: Update this section to work with the new wrapper function approach. The `_update_method_wrapper` calls should still preserve decorator-added attributes, but they'll be working with a more robust foundation where decorators received proper function objects during application.\n\nThe key insight is that instead of trying to fix attributes after decoration fails, we need to ensure decorators receive proper function-like objects with the expected attributes from the start. This requires coordinated changes across all three locations to create a wrapper function with proper attributes before decoration, rather than relying on post-decoration attribute copying.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py lines 40-42\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))\n        for dec in decorators:\n            bound_method = dec(bound_method)\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py lines 13-20\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndef _update_method_wrapper(_wrapper, decorator):\n    # _multi_decorate()'s bound_method isn't available in this scope.

The `partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))` creates a partial object that lacks function attributes like `__name__`. When decorators are applied in the loop, they receive this partial object and fail when trying to access `func.__name__`.\n\n**Location 2 (lines 13-20)**: The `_update_method_wrapper` function is a workaround that tries to apply decorators to a dummy function and copy attributes, but this doesn't solve the core problem - decorators still receive a partial object during the actual decoration process.\n\n**Location 3 (lines 46-47)**: This applies the workaround from Location 2, but it only helps after the fact, not during the critical decoration phase where the AttributeError occurs.\n\nThe fix needs to replace the partial object with a proper function wrapper that has the necessary attributes before decorators are applied.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django`\n- **Result**: Identified Django project structure with main code in `django/` directory and tests in `tests/`\n\n### 2. Code Location Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"method_decorator\"\n- **Result**: Found `method_decorator` is implemented in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py` and widely used across Django codebase (admin, auth, etc.)\n\n### 3. Core Implementation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - `method_decorator()` function starts at line 53\n  - Uses helper function `_multi_decorate()` (lines 22-50)\n  - Uses `_update_method_wrapper()` (lines 13-20) to handle wrapper attributes\n\n### 4. Bug Root Cause Identification\n- **Critical Issue Found**: In `_multi_decorate()` at line 40:\n  ```python\n  bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))\n  ```\n- **Problem**: The `partial` object lacks function attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc. that decorators expect to access\n- **Impact**: When decorators try to access these attributes on the partial object, they fail\n\n### 5. Test Context Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` in `/root/hy/projects_4/django/tests/decorators`\n- **Found**: Comprehensive test suite in `tests/decorators/tests.py` with `MethodDecoratorTests` class\n- **Key Test Pattern**: Tests verify that `__name__`, `__doc__`, and custom attributes are preserved after decoration\n\n## Current Technical Understanding\n\n### The Bug Mechanism\n1. `method_decorator()` creates a wrapper function that uses `_multi_decorate()`\n2. `_multi_decorate()` creates a `bound_method` using `partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))`\n3. Decorators are applied to this partial object: `bound_method = dec(bound_method)`\n4. **BUG**: Decorators expecting function attributes (like `__name__`) fail because partial objects don't have them\n\n### Current Workaround Attempt\n- `_update_method_wrapper()` tries to solve this by applying decorators to a dummy function and copying attributes\n- **Limitation**: This doesn't help the decorator itself when it's being applied - it still receives a partial object\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n### Immediate Actions Needed\n1. **Create Test Case**: Write a failing test that reproduces the bug when a decorator accesses `__name__`\n2. **Implement Fix**: Modify `_multi_decorate()` to ensure decorators receive a proper function-like object with necessary attributes\n3. **Verify Fix**: Run existing tests to ensure no regressions\n\n### Proposed Solution Direction\nReplace the partial object with a proper function wrapper that:\n- Has the correct signature (no `self` parameter)\n- Preserves function attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, `__doc__`\n- Can be decorated normally\n- Still maintains the closure over `self` for method calling\n\n## Files Requiring Modification\n- **Primary**: `/root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py` (lines 35-43)\n- **Testing**: `/root/hy/projects_4/django/tests/decorators/tests.py` (add regression test)\n\n## Technical Context\n- Django version: Latest development version\n- Python features used: `functools.partial`, `functools.update_wrapper`, `functools.wraps`\n- Core issue: Mismatch between decorator expectations and partial object capabilities\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py\nStart line: 40\nEnd line: 42\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py\nStart line: 13\nEnd line: 20\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py\nStart line: 46\nEnd line: 47\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nPerfect!

The `partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))` creates a partial object that lacks function attributes like `__name__`. When decorators are applied in the loop, they receive this partial object and fail when trying to access `func.__name__`.\n\n**Location 2 (lines 13-20)**: The `_update_method_wrapper` function is a workaround that tries to apply decorators to a dummy function and copy attributes, but this doesn't solve the core problem - decorators still receive a partial object during the actual decoration process.\n\n**Location 3 (lines 46-47)**: This applies the workaround from Location 2, but it only helps after the fact, not during the critical decoration phase where the AttributeError occurs.\n\nThe fix needs to replace the partial object with a proper function wrapper that has the necessary attributes before decorators are applied. This is a clear, well-defined problem with a straightforward solution.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, these locations are ready for fixing. The problem is clearly identified:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: Line 40 creates a `partial` object that lacks function attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc.\n\n2. **Failure Point**: Line 42 applies decorators to this partial object, causing AttributeError when decorators try to access `func.__name__`\n\n3. **Insufficient Workaround**: Lines 13-20 and 46-47 attempt to fix attributes after decoration, but the decorator itself still receives a deficient partial object\n\nThe solution is straightforward: Replace the partial object with a proper function wrapper that has the necessary attributes before applying decorators. This will allow decorators like the `logger` decorator in the problem statement to access `func.__name__` without errors.\n\nThe fix involves:\n- Location 1: Create a proper function wrapper instead of using partial\n- Location 2: Simplify or remove the workaround since it won't be needed\n- Location 3: Update to work with the new approach\n\nAll three locations are interconnected and ready for a coordinated fix.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_4/django/django/utils/decorators.py lines 40-42\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  from functools import partial, update_wrapper, wraps\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   30:         # order in which they appear in the iterable.\n[C]   31:         decorators = decorators[::-1]\n[C]   32:     else:\n[C]   33:         decorators = [decorators]\n[C]   34: \n[C]   35:     def _wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n[C]   36:         # bound_method has the signature that 'decorator' expects i.e. no\n[C]   37:         # 'self' argument, but it's a closure over self so it can call\n[C]   38:         # 'func'.
