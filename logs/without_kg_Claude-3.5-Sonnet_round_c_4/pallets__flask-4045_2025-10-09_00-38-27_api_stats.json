I can see the existing validation pattern in the `add_url_rule` method (lines 364 and 367-368) that validates endpoint names and view function names to ensure they don't contain dots. The same validation logic needs to be applied to blueprint names in the `__init__` method.\n\nLooking at the code:\n1. Line 350 shows how blueprint names are used: `options.get(\"name_prefix\", \"\") + self.name + \".\"` - this confirms that dots in blueprint names would interfere with the nested blueprint functionality\n2. Lines 364 and 367-368 show the existing validation pattern using assertions\n3. Line 191 in the `__init__` method is where `self.name = name` is assigned without validation\n\nThe bug is clear: blueprint names should be validated the same way endpoint names are validated. I need to add the validation right before line 191 in the `__init__` method.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Analysis and Fix Location\n\n### Root Cause\nThe Flask codebase validates endpoint names and view function names to prevent dots (lines 364, 367-368 in `blueprints.py`), but fails to validate blueprint names themselves. Since blueprint names are prepended to endpoint names with dots (as seen in line 350: `self.name + \".\"`), allowing dots in blueprint names would create ambiguity in the nested blueprint system.\n\n### Fix Location\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py`\n**Line Range**: 191 (single line fix needed)\n\nThe validation should be added immediately before the line `self.name = name` in the `Blueprint.__init__` method:\n\n```python\n# Add validation before line 191:\nassert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\nself.name = name  # existing line 191\n```\n\nThis follows the exact same pattern used for endpoint validation at lines 364 and 367-368, ensuring consistency across the codebase.",

Since blueprint names are prepended to endpoint names with dots (as seen in line 350: `self.name + \".\"`), allowing dots in blueprint names would create ambiguity in the nested blueprint system.\n\n### Fix Location\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py`\n**Line Range**: 191 (single line fix needed)\n\nThe validation should be added immediately before the line `self.name = name` in the `Blueprint.__init__` method:\n\n```python\n# Add validation before line 191:\nassert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\nself.name = name  # existing line 191\n```\n\nThis follows the exact same pattern used for endpoint validation at lines 364 and 367-368, ensuring consistency across the codebase.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nRaise error when blueprint name contains a dot\nThis is required since every dot is now significant since blueprints can be nested.

The validation logic exists for endpoint names (added in Flask 1.0) but was missed for blueprint names.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: \n  - Located Flask project at `/root/hy/projects_4/flask`\n  - Identified Flask source code in `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/`\n  - Key files identified: `blueprints.py`, `app.py`, `scaffold.py`\n\n### 2. Blueprint Implementation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`, `search_code_with_context`\n- **Results**:\n  - Found `Blueprint` class in `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py` at line 108\n  - Located `Blueprint.__init__` method (lines 171-183)\n  - **Critical Finding**: Blueprint name assignment occurs at line 191 with no validation: `self.name = name`\n\n### 3. Validation Pattern Search\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Results**: Search for existing endpoint validation patterns (`endpoint.*dot`) returned no matches\n- **Status**: Need to continue searching for the Flask 1.0 endpoint validation logic to understand the implementation pattern\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Project structure mapped\n- Blueprint class and initialization method located\n- Identified exact location where validation should be added (line 191 in `blueprints.py`)\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Searching for existing endpoint name validation logic to understand the pattern\n- Need to find where dots are validated in endpoint names\n\n### ❌ Pending\n- Implement blueprint name validation\n- Add appropriate error message\n- Test the fix\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Key Code Location\n```python\n# File: /root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\n# Line: 191\nself.name = name  # <- Validation should be added here\n```\n\n### Blueprint Name Significance\n- Blueprint names are prepended to endpoint names (documented at line 124-125)\n- Dots in blueprint names would conflict with nested blueprint functionality\n- Similar validation already exists for endpoint names since Flask 1.0\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Find Endpoint Validation Pattern**: Search for existing dot validation in endpoint names using different search terms\n2. **Implement Validation**: Add validation logic before `self.name = name` assignment\n3. **Error Message**: Create appropriate error message explaining why dots are not allowed\n4. **Testing**: Verify the fix works and doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Search Strategy for Next Phase\n- Search for \"dot\" or \".\" validation in Flask codebase\n- Look in `scaffold.py` for shared validation logic\n- Check `app.py` for endpoint registration validation\n- Search for error messages related to invalid names\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\nStart line: 191\nEnd line: 191\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI can see the Blueprint class documentation mentions that the name parameter \"Will be prepended to each endpoint name\" (line 124-125). This is key - since dots are significant for nested blueprints, blueprint names with dots would cause confusion in endpoint naming.\n\nI need to see the actual __init__ method implementation and find where the endpoint name validation was added in Flask 1.0 to understand the pattern.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: \n  - Located Flask project at `/root/hy/projects_4/flask`\n  - Identified Flask source code in `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/`\n  - Key files identified: `blueprints.py`, `app.py`, `scaffold.py`\n\n### 2. Blueprint Implementation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`, `search_code_with_context`\n- **Results**:\n  - Found `Blueprint` class in `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py` at line 108\n  - Located `Blueprint.__init__` method (lines 171-183)\n  - **Critical Finding**: Blueprint name assignment occurs at line 191 with no validation: `self.name = name`\n\n### 3. Validation Pattern Search\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Results**: Search for existing endpoint validation patterns (`endpoint.*dot`) returned no matches\n- **Status**: Need to continue searching for the Flask 1.0 endpoint validation logic to understand the implementation pattern\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Project structure mapped\n- Blueprint class and initialization method located\n- Identified exact location where validation should be added (line 191 in `blueprints.py`)\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Searching for existing endpoint name validation logic to understand the pattern\n- Need to find where dots are validated in endpoint names\n\n### ❌ Pending\n- Implement blueprint name validation\n- Add appropriate error message\n- Test the fix\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Key Code Location\n```python\n# File: /root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\n# Line: 191\nself.name = name  # <- Validation should be added here\n```\n\n### Blueprint Name Significance\n- Blueprint names are prepended to endpoint names (documented at line 124-125)\n- Dots in blueprint names would conflict with nested blueprint functionality\n- Similar validation already exists for endpoint names since Flask 1.0\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Find Endpoint Validation Pattern**: Search for existing dot validation in endpoint names using different search terms\n2. **Implement Validation**: Add validation logic before `self.name = name` assignment\n3. **Error Message**: Create appropriate error message explaining why dots are not allowed\n4. **Testing**: Verify the fix works and doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Search Strategy for Next Phase\n- Search for \"dot\" or \".\" validation in Flask codebase\n- Look in `scaffold.py` for shared validation logic\n- Check `app.py` for endpoint registration validation\n- Search for error messages related to invalid names\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\nStart line: 191\nEnd line: 191\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nI have thoroughly analyzed the Flask blueprint name validation bug.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: \n  - Located Flask project at `/root/hy/projects_4/flask`\n  - Identified Flask source code in `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/`\n  - Key files identified: `blueprints.py`, `app.py`, `scaffold.py`\n\n### 2. Blueprint Implementation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`, `search_code_with_context`\n- **Results**:\n  - Found `Blueprint` class in `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py` at line 108\n  - Located `Blueprint.__init__` method (lines 171-183)\n  - **Critical Finding**: Blueprint name assignment occurs at line 191 with no validation: `self.name = name`\n\n### 3. Validation Pattern Search\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Results**: Search for existing endpoint validation patterns (`endpoint.*dot`) returned no matches\n- **Status**: Need to continue searching for the Flask 1.0 endpoint validation logic to understand the implementation pattern\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Project structure mapped\n- Blueprint class and initialization method located\n- Identified exact location where validation should be added (line 191 in `blueprints.py`)\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Searching for existing endpoint name validation logic to understand the pattern\n- Need to find where dots are validated in endpoint names\n\n### ❌ Pending\n- Implement blueprint name validation\n- Add appropriate error message\n- Test the fix\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Key Code Location\n```python\n# File: /root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\n# Line: 191\nself.name = name  # <- Validation should be added here\n```\n\n### Blueprint Name Significance\n- Blueprint names are prepended to endpoint names (documented at line 124-125)\n- Dots in blueprint names would conflict with nested blueprint functionality\n- Similar validation already exists for endpoint names since Flask 1.0\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Find Endpoint Validation Pattern**: Search for existing dot validation in endpoint names using different search terms\n2. **Implement Validation**: Add validation logic before `self.name = name` assignment\n3. **Error Message**: Create appropriate error message explaining why dots are not allowed\n4. **Testing**: Verify the fix works and doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Search Strategy for Next Phase\n- Search for \"dot\" or \".\" validation in Flask codebase\n- Look in `scaffold.py` for shared validation logic\n- Check `app.py` for endpoint registration validation\n- Search for error messages related to invalid names\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\nStart line: 191\nEnd line: 191\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\n#REFLECT\nI have thoroughly analyzed the Flask blueprint name validation bug.

The same validation logic needs to be applied to blueprint names in the `__init__` method.\n\nLooking at the code:\n1.

Line 191 in the `__init__` method is where `self.name = name` is assigned without validation\n\nThe bug is clear: blueprint names should be validated the same way endpoint names are validated. I need to add the validation right before line 191 in the `__init__` method.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Analysis and Fix Location\n\n### Root Cause\nThe Flask codebase validates endpoint names and view function names to prevent dots (lines 364, 367-368 in `blueprints.py`), but fails to validate blueprint names themselves. Since blueprint names are prepended to endpoint names with dots (as seen in line 350: `self.name + \".\"`), allowing dots in blueprint names would create ambiguity in the nested blueprint system.\n\n### Fix Location\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py`\n**Line Range**: 191 (single line fix needed)\n\nThe validation should be added immediately before the line `self.name = name` in the `Blueprint.__init__` method:\n\n```python\n# Add validation before line 191:\nassert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\nself.name = name  # existing line 191\n```\n\nThis follows the exact same pattern used for endpoint validation at lines 364 and 367-368, ensuring consistency across the codebase.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis, I have identified the root cause and the precise location where the bug needs to be fixed. The issue is that Flask validates endpoint names and view function names to prevent dots (since dots are significant for nested blueprints), but fails to validate blueprint names themselves in the `Blueprint.__init__` method.\n\nThe existing validation pattern is already established in the codebase at lines 364 and 367-368, and the same validation logic needs to be applied to blueprint names at the point where they are assigned.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 191,\n            \"end_line\": 191\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n#REFLECT\nI have thoroughly analyzed the Flask blueprint name validation bug.

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Flask Blueprint Name Validation Bug Fix - Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nFix a bug in Flask where blueprint names containing dots should raise an error because dots are now significant for nested blueprints. The validation logic exists for endpoint names (added in Flask 1.0) but was missed for blueprint names.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: \n  - Located Flask project at `/root/hy/projects_4/flask`\n  - Identified Flask source code in `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/`\n  - Key files identified: `blueprints.py`, `app.py`, `scaffold.py`\n\n### 2. Blueprint Implementation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`, `search_code_with_context`\n- **Results**:\n  - Found `Blueprint` class in `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py` at line 108\n  - Located `Blueprint.__init__` method (lines 171-183)\n  - **Critical Finding**: Blueprint name assignment occurs at line 191 with no validation: `self.name = name`\n\n### 3. Validation Pattern Search\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context`\n- **Results**: Search for existing endpoint validation patterns (`endpoint.*dot`) returned no matches\n- **Status**: Need to continue searching for the Flask 1.0 endpoint validation logic to understand the implementation pattern\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Project structure mapped\n- Blueprint class and initialization method located\n- Identified exact location where validation should be added (line 191 in `blueprints.py`)\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Searching for existing endpoint name validation logic to understand the pattern\n- Need to find where dots are validated in endpoint names\n\n### ❌ Pending\n- Implement blueprint name validation\n- Add appropriate error message\n- Test the fix\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Key Code Location\n```python\n# File: /root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\n# Line: 191\nself.name = name  # <- Validation should be added here\n```\n\n### Blueprint Name Significance\n- Blueprint names are prepended to endpoint names (documented at line 124-125)\n- Dots in blueprint names would conflict with nested blueprint functionality\n- Similar validation already exists for endpoint names since Flask 1.0\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Find Endpoint Validation Pattern**: Search for existing dot validation in endpoint names using different search terms\n2. **Implement Validation**: Add validation logic before `self.name = name` assignment\n3. **Error Message**: Create appropriate error message explaining why dots are not allowed\n4. **Testing**: Verify the fix works and doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Search Strategy for Next Phase\n- Search for \"dot\" or \".\" validation in Flask codebase\n- Look in `scaffold.py` for shared validation logic\n- Check `app.py` for endpoint registration validation\n- Search for error messages related to invalid names\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nI can see the Blueprint class documentation mentions that the name parameter \"Will be prepended to each endpoint name\" (line 124-125). This is key - since dots are significant for nested blueprints, blueprint names with dots would cause confusion in endpoint naming.\n\nI need to see the actual __init__ method implementation and find where the endpoint name validation was added in Flask 1.0 to understand the pattern. Let me continue reading the Blueprint __init__ method.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\", \"start_line\": 158, \"end_line\": 208 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\nTotal lines: 542\nShowing lines 158-207:\n\n 158:     .. versionadded:: 0.7\n 159:     \"\"\"\n 160: \n 161:     warn_on_modifications = False\n 162:     _got_registered_once = False\n 163: \n 164:     #: Blueprint local JSON encoder class to use.

Now I have all the context I need. I can see the existing validation pattern in the `add_url_rule` method (lines 364 and 367-368) that validates endpoint names and view function names to ensure they don't contain dots. The same validation logic needs to be applied to blueprint names in the `__init__` method.\n\nLooking at the code:\n1. Line 350 shows how blueprint names are used: `options.get(\"name_prefix\", \"\") + self.name + \".\"` - this confirms that dots in blueprint names would interfere with the nested blueprint functionality\n2. Lines 364 and 367-368 show the existing validation pattern using assertions\n3. Line 191 in the `__init__` method is where `self.name = name` is assigned without validation\n\nThe bug is clear: blueprint names should be validated the same way endpoint names are validated. I need to add the validation right before line 191 in the `__init__` method.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Analysis and Fix Location\n\n### Root Cause\nThe Flask codebase validates endpoint names and view function names to prevent dots (lines 364, 367-368 in `blueprints.py`), but fails to validate blueprint names themselves. Since blueprint names are prepended to endpoint names with dots (as seen in line 350: `self.name + \".\"`), allowing dots in blueprint names would create ambiguity in the nested blueprint system.\n\n### Fix Location\n**File**: `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py`\n**Line Range**: 191 (single line fix needed)\n\nThe validation should be added immediately before the line `self.name = name` in the `Blueprint.__init__` method:\n\n```python\n# Add validation before line 191:\nassert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\nself.name = name  # existing line 191\n```\n\nThis follows the exact same pattern used for endpoint validation at lines 364 and 367-368, ensuring consistency across the codebase.\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis, I have identified the root cause and the precise location where the bug needs to be fixed. The issue is that Flask validates endpoint names and view function names to prevent dots (since dots are significant for nested blueprints), but fails to validate blueprint names themselves in the `Blueprint.__init__` method.\n\nThe existing validation pattern is already established in the codebase at lines 364 and 367-368, and the same validation logic needs to be applied to blueprint names at the point where they are assigned.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 191,\n            \"end_line\": 191\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nI have thoroughly analyzed the Flask blueprint name validation bug. The problem is clear: blueprint names containing dots should raise an error because dots are significant for nested blueprints, but the validation logic that exists for endpoint names was not applied to blueprint names.\n\nFrom my analysis:\n1.

    "response": "# Flask Blueprint Name Validation Bug Fix - Complete Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nFix a bug in Flask where blueprint names containing dots should raise an error because dots are now significant for nested blueprints. The validation logic exists for endpoint names (added in Flask 1.0) but was missed for blueprint names.\n\n## Complete Analysis and Solution\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Results**: \n  - Located Flask project at `/root/hy/projects_4/flask`\n  - Identified Flask source code in `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/`\n  - Key files identified: `blueprints.py`, `app.py`, `scaffold.py`\n\n### 2. Blueprint Implementation Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines`, `search_code_with_context`\n- **Results**:\n  - Found `Blueprint` class in `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py` at line 108\n  - Located `Blueprint.__init__` method (lines 171-183)\n  - **Critical Finding**: Blueprint name assignment occurs at line 191 with no validation: `self.name = name`\n\n### 3. Existing Validation Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"dot\"\n- **Key Discovery**: Found existing validation logic in the same file at lines 364 and 367-368:\n  ```python\n  assert \".\" not in endpoint, \"Blueprint endpoints should not contain dots\"\n  assert \".\" not in view_func.__name__, \"Blueprint view function name should not contain dots\"\n  ```\n- **Context Analysis**: Line 350 shows how blueprint names are used: `self.name + \".\"` - confirming dots would interfere with nested blueprint functionality\n\n### 4. Root Cause Identification\n- **Problem**: Flask validates endpoint names and view function names to prevent dots, but fails to validate blueprint names themselves\n- **Impact**: Blueprint names with dots would create ambiguity in nested blueprint system where dots serve as separators\n- **Evidence**: Blueprint names are prepended to endpoint names with dots (line 350: `options.get(\"name_prefix\", \"\") + self.name + \".\"`)\n\n## Technical Implementation Details\n\n### Bug Location Confirmed\n- **File**: `/root/hy/projects_4/flask/src/flask/blueprints.py`\n- **Line**: 191\n- **Current Code**: `self.name = name` (no validation)\n- **Context**: Inside `Blueprint.__init__` method after `super().__init__()` call\n\n### Validation Pattern Established\n- **Existing Pattern**: Uses `assert` statements with descriptive error messages\n- **Consistency**: Same pattern used for endpoint validation at lines 364 and 367-368\n- **Error Message Format**: `\"Blueprint [type] should not contain dots\"`\n\n### Solution Implemented\n- **Fix Applied**: Added validation before name assignment\n- **Code Added**: `assert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"`\n- **Location**: Immediately before line 191 (`self.name = name`)\n- **Indentation**: Matched existing code context (8 spaces)\n\n## Final Status\n\n### ✅ Completed Actions\n1. **Project Structure Mapped**: Located all relevant Flask source files\n2. **Bug Location Identified**: Found exact line where validation was missing (line 191)\n3. **Existing Pattern Discovered**: Found validation logic for endpoints at lines 364, 367-368\n4. **Root Cause Analyzed**: Confirmed dots in blueprint names would interfere with nested blueprint functionality\n5. **Solution Proposed**: Added assertion validation following established pattern\n6. **Patch Generated**: Created properly indented fix matching existing code style\n\n### 🔧 Technical Solution Details\n```python\n# Before (line 191):\nself.name = name\n\n# After (fixed):\nassert \".\" not in name, \"Blueprint names should not contain dots\"\nself.name = name\n```\n\n### 📋 Implementation Characteristics\n- **No New Imports Required**: Uses built-in `assert` statement\n- **Consistent Error Handling**: Follows same pattern as existing endpoint validation\n- **Minimal Code Change**: Single line addition with no side effects\n- **Proper Indentation**: Matches surrounding code context (8 spaces)\n- **Clear Error Message**: Descriptive message explaining why dots are not allowed\n\n### 🎯 Bug Fix Validation\n- **Pattern Consistency**: Uses identical validation approach as lines 364, 367-368\n- **Functional Correctness**: Prevents dots in blueprint names before assignment\n- **Error Clarity**: Provides clear explanation of why validation failed\n- **Integration**: Seamlessly fits into existing `__init__` method flow\n\n## Next Steps for Testing\n1. **Unit Tests**: Verify blueprint creation with dots raises appropriate error\n2. **Integration Tests**: Ensure existing blueprint functionality remains unaffected\n3. **Edge Cases**: Test empty names, special characters, and valid names\n4. **Regression Testing**: Confirm no breaking changes to existing Flask applications\n\nThe bug has been successfully identified, analyzed, and fixed with a minimal, consistent solution that follows Flask's established validation patterns.",
