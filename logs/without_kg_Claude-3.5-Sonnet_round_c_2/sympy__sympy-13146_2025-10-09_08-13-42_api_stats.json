The issue is that `expr1 = S(1)/2*x**2.5` and `expr2 = S(1)*x**(S(5)/2)/2` should be mathematically equivalent (since 2.5 = 5/2), but when subtracted and simplified, the result shows `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5` instead of simplifying to 0.\n\nThis suggests the bug is in how SymPy handles:\n1. Fractional exponents (float vs rational representation)\n2. Expression simplification logic\n3. Possibly the `evalf()` method or `simplify()` function\n\nLet me explore the sympy directory to understand the structure better and locate the simplification modules.\n\n#TOOL_CALL explore_directory { \"dir_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nContents of /root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy:\n__init__.py\n__pycache__/\nabc.py\nassumptions/\nbenchmarks/\ncalculus/\ncategories/\ncodegen/\ncombinatorics/\nconcrete/\nconftest.py\ncore/\ncrypto/\ndeprecated/\ndiffgeom/\nexternal/\nfunctions/\ngalgebra.py\ngeometry/\nholonomic/\nintegrals/\ninteractive/\nliealgebras/\nlogic/\nmatrices/\nntheory/\nparsing/\nphysics/\nplotting/\npolys/\nprinting/\nrelease.py\nsandbox/\nseries/\nsets/\nsimplify/\nsolvers/\nstats/\nstrategies/\ntensor/\nunify/\nutilities/\nvector/\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nI can see that the issue is related to simplification of expressions with fractional exponents.

Simplification Module Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy/simplify`\n- **Result**: Found relevant files including:\n  - `powsimp.py` - Power simplification logic\n  - `simplify.py` - Main simplification functions\n  - `radsimp.py` - Radical simplification\n\n### 3. Core Module Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy/core`\n- **Result**: Identified `power.py` as the key file handling power expressions\n\n### 4. Power Module Code Review\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy/core/power.py`\n- **Result**: Located the `Pow` class (lines 102+) which defines how SymPy handles power expressions\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed\n- ✅ Identified the root cause: Float vs rational exponent representation inconsistency\n- ✅ Located relevant source files (`power.py`, `powsimp.py`)\n- ✅ Found the `Pow` class definition that handles power expressions\n\n### In Progress\n- 🔄 Analyzing the `Pow` class constructor and exponent normalization logic\n- 🔄 Understanding how SymPy compares and simplifies power expressions\n\n### Next Steps Needed\n1. **Examine Pow class constructor**: Review how the `Pow` class handles different exponent types during initialization\n2. **Analyze exponent normalization**: Check if there's logic to convert float exponents to rational form\n3. **Review simplification logic**: Understand how `powsimp()` and related functions handle exponent comparison\n4. **Identify fix location**: Determine where to implement the normalization fix\n5. **Create test case**: Develop a test to verify the fix works correctly\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n- `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy/core/power.py` - Contains `Pow` class definition\n- `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` - Power simplification functions\n- `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy/simplify/simplify.py` - Main simplification entry points\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe issue stems from SymPy's internal representation where:\n- `x**2.5` creates a `Pow` object with a float exponent\n- `x**(S(5)/2)` creates a `Pow` object with a rational exponent\n- These are treated as distinct expressions despite mathematical equivalence\n\n### Potential Solution Approach\nThe fix likely involves normalizing float exponents to their rational equivalents during `Pow` object creation or during simplification, ensuring that `2.5` is automatically converted to `S(5)/2` for consistent internal representation.\n\n## Issues Encountered\n- None so far - investigation is proceeding smoothly with clear identification of the problem area\n\nThis investigation has successfully identified the core issue and located the relevant source code areas. The next phase should focus on examining the `Pow` class implementation details to determine the exact fix needed.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI can see the issue now.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Summary: SymPy Bug Investigation - Fractional Exponent Simplification Issue\n\n## Main Objective\nInvestigating and repairing a bug in SymPy where expressions with fractional exponents are not being properly simplified. Specifically, mathematically equivalent expressions like `x**2.5` and `x**(S(5)/2)` are not being recognized as equal during simplification.\n\n## Problem Description\n- **Issue**: `expr1 = S(1)/2*x**2.5` and `expr2 = S(1)*x**(S(5)/2)/2` should be mathematically equivalent (since 2.5 = 5/2)\n- **Expected**: When subtracted and simplified, the result should be 0\n- **Actual**: The result shows `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5` instead of simplifying to 0\n- **Root Cause**: SymPy treats float exponents (2.5) and rational exponents (S(5)/2) as different expressions\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy`\n- **Result**: Identified main SymPy directory structure with key modules including `sympy/simplify/` and `sympy/core/`\n\n### 2. Simplification Module Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy/simplify`\n- **Result**: Found relevant files including:\n  - `powsimp.py` - Power simplification logic\n  - `simplify.py` - Main simplification functions\n  - `radsimp.py` - Radical simplification\n\n### 3. Core Module Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy/core`\n- **Result**: Identified `power.py` as the key file handling power expressions\n\n### 4. Power Module Code Review\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` and `search_code_with_context`\n- **Target**: `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy/core/power.py`\n- **Result**: Located the `Pow` class (lines 102+) which defines how SymPy handles power expressions\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed\n- ✅ Identified the root cause: Float vs rational exponent representation inconsistency\n- ✅ Located relevant source files (`power.py`, `powsimp.py`)\n- ✅ Found the `Pow` class definition that handles power expressions\n\n### In Progress\n- 🔄 Analyzing the `Pow` class constructor and exponent normalization logic\n- 🔄 Understanding how SymPy compares and simplifies power expressions\n\n### Next Steps Needed\n1. **Examine Pow class constructor**: Review how the `Pow` class handles different exponent types during initialization\n2. **Analyze exponent normalization**: Check if there's logic to convert float exponents to rational form\n3. **Review simplification logic**: Understand how `powsimp()` and related functions handle exponent comparison\n4. **Identify fix location**: Determine where to implement the normalization fix\n5. **Create test case**: Develop a test to verify the fix works correctly\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Key Files Identified\n- `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy/core/power.py` - Contains `Pow` class definition\n- `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` - Power simplification functions\n- `/root/hy/projects_2/sympy/sympy/simplify/simplify.py` - Main simplification entry points\n\n### Problem Analysis\nThe issue stems from SymPy's internal representation where:\n- `x**2.5` creates a `Pow` object with a float exponent\n- `x**(S(5)/2)` creates a `Pow` object with a rational exponent\n- These are treated as distinct expressions despite mathematical equivalence\n\n### Potential Solution Approach\nThe fix likely involves normalizing float exponents to their rational equivalents during `Pow` object creation or during simplification, ensuring that `2.5` is automatically converted to `S(5)/2` for consistent internal representation.\n\n## Issues Encountered\n- None so far - investigation is proceeding smoothly with clear identification of the problem area\n\nThis investigation has successfully identified the core issue and located the relevant source code areas. The next phase should focus on examining the `Pow` class implementation details to determine the exact fix needed.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nI can see the issue now.
