Looking at the `_estimate_mi` function in `/root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`, I can see the issue clearly:\n\nAt line 250, there's the comparison `if discrete_features == 'auto':` which is problematic because:\n\n1. `discrete_features` can be a string ('auto'), a boolean, or an array (indices or boolean mask)\n2. When `discrete_features` is an array, the comparison `discrete_features == 'auto'` will try to compare an array to a string\n3. This creates a numpy array of boolean values, which in future numpy versions will raise a FutureWarning or error when used in an `if` statement\n\nThe bug is specifically at line 250 where the comparison should use a proper method to check if `discrete_features` is the string 'auto' rather than using `==` which doesn't work properly with arrays.\n\nLet me examine if there are any tests for this function to understand the scope better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context {\"keyword\": \"test.*_estimate_mi\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn\"}\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'test.*_estimate_mi' in directory '/root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn'\nLet me search for tests related to mutual information functions to understand the testing coverage.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context {\"keyword\": \"mutual_info\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/tests\"}\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'mutual_info' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_feature_select.py\nLines 23-29:\n  23: from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import (make_classification,\n  24:                                                 make_regression)\n  25: from sklearn.feature_selection import (\n  26:     chi2, f_classif, f_oneway, f_regression, mutual_info_classif,\n  27:     mutual_info_regression, SelectPercentile, SelectKBest, SelectFpr,\n  28:     SelectFdr, SelectFwe, GenericUnivariateSelect)\n  29: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_feature_select.py\nLines 24-30:\n  24:                                                 make_regression)\n  25: from sklearn.feature_selection import (\n  26:     chi2, f_classif, f_oneway, f_regression, mutual_info_classif,\n  27:     mutual_info_regression, SelectPercentile, SelectKBest, SelectFpr,\n  28:     SelectFdr, SelectFwe, GenericUnivariateSelect)\n  29: \n  30: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_feature_select.py\nLines 611-617:\n 611:         assert_equal(X_selected.shape, (40, 0))\n 612: \n 613: \n 614: def test_mutual_info_classif():\n 615:     X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=5,\n 616:                                n_informative=1, n_redundant=1,\n 617:                                n_repeated=0, n_classes=2,\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_feature_select.py\nLines 619-625:\n 619:                                class_sep=10, shuffle=False, random_state=0)\n 620: \n 621:     #

Looking at the `_estimate_mi` function in `/root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`, I can see the issue clearly:\n\nAt line 250, there's the comparison `if discrete_features == 'auto':` which is problematic because:\n\n1. `discrete_features` can be a string ('auto'), a boolean, or an array (indices or boolean mask)\n2. When `discrete_features` is an array, the comparison `discrete_features == 'auto'` will try to compare an array to a string\n3. This creates a numpy array of boolean values, which in future numpy versions will raise a FutureWarning or error when used in an `if` statement\n\nThe bug is specifically at line 250 where the comparison should use a proper method to check if `discrete_features` is the string 'auto' rather than using `==` which doesn't work properly with arrays.\n\nLet me examine if there are any tests for this function to understand the scope better.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context {\"keyword\": \"test.*_estimate_mi\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn\"}\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'test.*_estimate_mi' in directory '/root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn'\n\nAssistant: Let me search for tests related to mutual information functions to understand the testing coverage.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context {\"keyword\": \"mutual_info\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/tests\"}\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'mutual_info' in directory (showing first 15 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_feature_select.py\nLines 23-29:\n  23: from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import (make_classification,\n  24:                                                 make_regression)\n  25: from sklearn.feature_selection import (\n  26:     chi2, f_classif, f_oneway, f_regression, mutual_info_classif,\n  27:     mutual_info_regression, SelectPercentile, SelectKBest, SelectFpr,\n  28:     SelectFdr, SelectFwe, GenericUnivariateSelect)\n  29: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_feature_select.py\nLines 24-30:\n  24:                                                 make_regression)\n  25: from sklearn.feature_selection import (\n  26:     chi2, f_classif, f_oneway, f_regression, mutual_info_classif,\n  27:     mutual_info_regression, SelectPercentile, SelectKBest, SelectFpr,\n  28:     SelectFdr, SelectFwe, GenericUnivariateSelect)\n  29: \n  30: \n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_feature_select.py\nLines 611-617:\n 611:         assert_equal(X_selected.shape, (40, 0))\n 612: \n 613: \n 614: def test_mutual_info_classif():\n 615:     X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=5,\n 616:                                n_informative=1, n_redundant=1,\n 617:                                n_repeated=0, n_classes=2,\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_feature_select.py\nLines 619-625:\n 619:                                class_sep=10, shuffle=False, random_state=0)\n 620: \n 621:     #

This comparison is problematic because:\n\n1. **Parameter Type Flexibility**: The `discrete_features` parameter can be:\n   - A string (`'auto'`)\n   - A boolean (`True`/`False`)\n   - An array (either boolean mask or indices of discrete features)\n\n2. **Array Comparison Issue**: When `discrete_features` is an array, the expression `discrete_features == 'auto'` attempts to compare an array to a string, which:\n   - Creates a numpy array of boolean values\n   - In future numpy versions, using this array in an `if` statement will raise a FutureWarning or error\n   - The current behavior is undefined and unreliable\n\n### Evidence from Testing\nThe test suite includes cases that trigger this bug:\n- **Test file**: `/root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_mutual_info.py`\n- **Specific case**: Lines 161-162 and 165-166 use `discrete_features=[2]` (array format)\n- This confirms the bug affects real usage scenarios\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Current Code Structure (Lines 248-262)\n```python\nn_samples, n_features = X.shape\n\nif discrete_features == 'auto':  # ← BUG: Problematic comparison\n    discrete_features = issparse(X)\n\nif isinstance(discrete_features, bool):\n    discrete_mask = np.empty(n_features, dtype=bool)\n    discrete_mask.fill(discrete_features)\nelse:\n    discrete_features = np.asarray(discrete_features)\n    if discrete_features.dtype != 'bool':\n        discrete_mask = np.zeros(n_features, dtype=bool)\n        discrete_mask[discrete_features] = True\n    else:\n        discrete_mask = discrete_features\n```\n\n### Required Fix\nReplace the problematic comparison with a proper string check that works safely with arrays:\n\n```python\n# Instead of: if discrete_features == 'auto':\n# Use: if discrete_features is 'auto' or discrete_features == 'auto':\n# Or better: if isinstance(discrete_features, str) and discrete_features == 'auto':\n```\n\n## Tools Used and Results\n\n1. **search_code_with_context**: Successfully located the `_estimate_mi` function and related test cases\n2. **read_file_lines**: Examined the specific implementation details and identified the exact problematic line\n3. **Code analysis**: Confirmed the bug affects both `mutual_info_classif` and `mutual_info_regression` functions since they both call `_estimate_mi`\n\n## Current Status\n- ✅ **Bug Located**: Identified exact location and cause\n- ✅ **Impact Assessed**: Affects array-based `discrete_features` parameter usage\n- ✅ **Test Cases Found**: Located existing tests that trigger the bug\n- 🔄 **Fix Needed**: Ready to implement the repair\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1.

Comparing an array to a string produces a numpy array of boolean values, which will cause warnings/errors in future numpy versions when used in an `if` statement.\n\n**Repair Suggestion:**\n\n1. **Line 250**: Replace the problematic comparison `if discrete_features == 'auto':` with a type-safe check that properly handles when `discrete_features` is an array, boolean, or string.\n\n**Recommended Fix:**\n```python\n# Replace line 250:\n# if discrete_features == 'auto':\n\n# With:\nif isinstance(discrete_features, str) and discrete_features == 'auto':\n```\n\n**Why this fix works:**\n- First checks if `discrete_features` is a string type before doing the string comparison\n- Avoids the problematic array-to-string comparison entirely\n- Maintains the same logical behavior for all valid input types\n- Is forward-compatible with future numpy versions\n- Preserves existing functionality while fixing the type safety issue\n\nThis single-line change resolves the bug by ensuring the comparison only happens when `discrete_features` is actually a string, preventing the array comparison issue that causes the numpy warning/error.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py lines 250-250\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    if discrete_features == 'auto':\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, the location is ready for fixing. The code segment at line 250 contains the exact problematic comparison identified in the bug report:\n\n```python\nif discrete_features == 'auto':\n```\n\nThis line needs to be replaced with the type-safe comparison I suggested:\n\n```python\nif isinstance(discrete_features, str) and discrete_features == 'auto':\n```\n\nThe location is clearly identified, the root cause is understood, and the fix is straightforward and low-risk. This single-line change will resolve the numpy compatibility issue while preserving all existing functionality.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/scikit-learn/sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py lines 250-250\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import numpy as np\n  from scipy.sparse import issparse\n  from scipy.special import digamma\n  from ..metrics.cluster.supervised import mutual_info_score\n  from ..neighbors import NearestNeighbors\n  from ..preprocessing import scale\n  from ..utils import check_random_state\n  from ..utils.fixes import _astype_copy_false\n  from ..utils.validation import check_X_y\n  from ..utils.multiclass import check_classification_targets\n  from k-nearest neighbors distances as described in [2]_ and [3]_.
