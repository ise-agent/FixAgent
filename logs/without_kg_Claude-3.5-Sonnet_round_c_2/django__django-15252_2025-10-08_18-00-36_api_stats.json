What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1. What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

[输出被截断，原始长度: 5788 字符，显示前 5000 字符]\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1. What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality that may be related to the bug\n\n### Pending Investigation:\n1. 🔍 **Need to examine the complete `test_migrate_record_replaced` test** to understand the expected behavior\n2. 🔍 **Need to investigate database routing integration** with MigrationRecorder\n3. 🔍 **Need to identify the specific bug** - likely related to how `ensure_schema()` or `record_applied()` interacts with database routers\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n\n### Database Routing Context:\n- Multiple router classes found that implement `allow_migrate()` method\n- Routers can return `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n- The bug likely involves how MigrationRecorder respects router decisions\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Read the complete failing test** to understand the expected behavior\n2. **Examine how database routers should interact** with MigrationRecorder methods\n3. **Identify the specific bug** - likely in `ensure_schema()` or `record_applied()` not respecting router `allow_migrate()` decisions\n4. **Implement the fix** to ensure MigrationRecorder respects database routing rules\n5. **Verify the fix** by running the failing test\n\nThe investigation suggests the bug is related to MigrationRecorder not properly checking database router `allow_migrate()` permissions before creating tables or recording migrations.",

We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection.

Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I have a much clearer understanding of the bug. Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\n**The Bug**: MigrationRecorder does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules when creating the django_migrations table.\n\n**Current Behavior**: \n- When `record_applied()` is called, it first calls `ensure_schema()`\n- `ensure_schema()` creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist\n- This happens regardless of what the database router's `allow_migrate()` method returns\n- So even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n- MigrationRecorder should check the router's `allow_migrate()` method before creating tables\n- If `allow_migrate()` returns False for a database, no migration table should be created there\n\n**Key Methods to Examine**:\n1. `ensure_schema()` - likely needs to check `allow_migrate()` before creating table\n2. `record_applied()` - calls `ensure_schema()`, may need router checks\n3. `record_unapplied()` - probably has similar issues\n4. `applied_migrations()` - may also need router checks\n\nLet me examine the MigrationRecorder's `ensure_schema()` method more closely to see how it currently works and where the router check should be added.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 40, \"end_line\": 80 }",

Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\n**The Bug**: MigrationRecorder does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules when creating the django_migrations table.\n\n**Current Behavior**: \n- When `record_applied()` is called, it first calls `ensure_schema()`\n- `ensure_schema()` creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist\n- This happens regardless of what the database router's `allow_migrate()` method returns\n- So even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n- MigrationRecorder should check the router's `allow_migrate()` method before creating tables\n- If `allow_migrate()` returns False for a database, no migration table should be created there\n\n**Key Methods to Examine**:\n1. `ensure_schema()` - likely needs to check `allow_migrate()` before creating table\n2. `record_applied()` - calls `ensure_schema()`, may need router checks\n3. `record_unapplied()` - probably has similar issues\n4. `applied_migrations()` - may also need router checks\n\nLet me examine the MigrationRecorder's `ensure_schema()` method more closely to see how it currently works and where the router check should be added.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 40, \"end_line\": 80 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 40-80:\n\n  40:                 def __str__(self):\n  41:                     return 'Migration %s for %s' % (self.name, self.app)\n  42: \n  43:             cls._migration_class = Migration\n  44:         return cls._migration_class\n  45: \n  46:     def __init__(self, connection):\n  47:         self.connection = connection\n  48: \n  49:     @property\n  50:     def migration_qs(self):\n  51:         return self.Migration.objects.using(self.connection.alias)\n  52: \n  53:     def has_table(self):\n  54:         \"\"\"Return True if the django_migrations table exists.\"\"\"\n  55:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n  56:             tables = self.connection.introspection.table_names(cursor)\n  57:         return self.Migration._meta.db_table in tables\n  58: \n  59:     def ensure_schema(self):\n  60:         \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n  61:         # If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema\n  62:         # in the codebase.\n  63:         if self.has_table():\n  64:             return\n  65:         # Make the table\n  66:         try:\n  67:             with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n  68:                 editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n  69:         except DatabaseError as exc:\n  70:             raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n  71: \n  72:     def applied_migrations(self):\n  73:         \"\"\"\n  74:         Return a dict mapping (app_name, migration_name) to Migration instances\n  75:         for all applied migrations.\n  76:         \"\"\"\n  77:         if self.has_table():\n  78:             return {(migration.app, migration.name): migration for migration in self.migration_qs}\n  79:         else:\n  80:             # If the django_migrations table doesn't exist, then no migrations\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1. What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in a Django project related to the MigrationRecorder class and database routing functionality.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality that may be related to the bug\n\n### Pending Investigation:\n1. 🔍 **Need to examine the complete `test_migrate_record_replaced` test** to understand the expected behavior\n2. 🔍 **Need to investigate database routing integration** with MigrationRecorder\n3. 🔍 **Need to identify the specific bug** - likely related to how `ensure_schema()` or `record_applied()` interacts with database routers\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n\n### Database Routing Context:\n- Multiple router classes found that implement `allow_migrate()` method\n- Routers can return `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n- The bug likely involves how MigrationRecorder respects router decisions\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Read the complete failing test** to understand the expected behavior\n2. **Examine how database routers should interact** with MigrationRecorder methods\n3. **Identify the specific bug** - likely in `ensure_schema()` or `record_applied()` not respecting router `allow_migrate()` decisions\n4. **Implement the fix** to ensure MigrationRecorder respects database routing rules\n5. **Verify the fix** by running the failing test\n\nThe investigation suggests the bug is related to MigrationRecorder not properly checking database router `allow_migrate()` permissions before creating tables or recording migrations.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me look at the specific test that's failing to understand the expected behavior better:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"allow_migrate\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'allow_migrate' in directory (showing first 11 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py\nLines 1152-1158:\n1152:                 #

Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\n**The Bug**: MigrationRecorder does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules when creating the django_migrations table.\n\n**Current Behavior**: \n- When `record_applied()` is called, it first calls `ensure_schema()`\n- `ensure_schema()` creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist\n- This happens regardless of what the database router's `allow_migrate()` method returns\n- So even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n- MigrationRecorder should check the router's `allow_migrate()` method before creating tables\n- If `allow_migrate()` returns False for a database, no migration table should be created there\n\n**Key Methods to Examine**:\n1. `ensure_schema()` - likely needs to check `allow_migrate()` before creating table\n2. `record_applied()` - calls `ensure_schema()`, may need router checks\n3. `record_unapplied()` - probably has similar issues\n4. `applied_migrations()` - may also need router checks\n\nLet me examine the MigrationRecorder's `ensure_schema()` method more closely to see how it currently works and where the router check should be added.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 40, \"end_line\": 80 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 40-80:\n\n  40:                 def __str__(self):\n  41:                     return 'Migration %s for %s' % (self.name, self.app)\n  42: \n  43:             cls._migration_class = Migration\n  44:         return cls._migration_class\n  45: \n  46:     def __init__(self, connection):\n  47:         self.connection = connection\n  48: \n  49:     @property\n  50:     def migration_qs(self):\n  51:         return self.Migration.objects.using(self.connection.alias)\n  52: \n  53:     def has_table(self):\n  54:         \"\"\"Return True if the django_migrations table exists.\"\"\"\n  55:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n  56:             tables = self.connection.introspection.table_names(cursor)\n  57:         return self.Migration._meta.db_table in tables\n  58: \n  59:     def ensure_schema(self):\n  60:         \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n  61:         #

What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality that may be related to the bug\n\n### Pending Investigation:\n1. 🔍 **Need to examine the complete `test_migrate_record_replaced` test** to understand the expected behavior\n2. 🔍 **Need to investigate database routing integration** with MigrationRecorder\n3. 🔍 **Need to identify the specific bug** - likely related to how `ensure_schema()` or `record_applied()` interacts with database routers\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n\n### Database Routing Context:\n- Multiple router classes found that implement `allow_migrate()` method\n- Routers can return `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n- The bug likely involves how MigrationRecorder respects router decisions\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Read the complete failing test** to understand the expected behavior\n2. **Examine how database routers should interact** with MigrationRecorder methods\n3. **Identify the specific bug** - likely in `ensure_schema()` or `record_applied()` not respecting router `allow_migrate()` decisions\n4. **Implement the fix** to ensure MigrationRecorder respects database routing rules\n5. **Verify the fix** by running the failing test\n\nThe investigation suggests the bug is related to MigrationRecorder not properly checking database router `allow_migrate()` permissions before creating tables or recording migrations.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me look at the specific test that's failing to understand the expected behavior better:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"allow_migrate\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'allow_migrate' in directory (showing first 11 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py\nLines 1152-1158:\n1152:                 #

Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\n**The Bug**: MigrationRecorder does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules when creating the django_migrations table.\n\n**Current Behavior**: \n- When `record_applied()` is called, it first calls `ensure_schema()`\n- `ensure_schema()` creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist\n- This happens regardless of what the database router's `allow_migrate()` method returns\n- So even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n- MigrationRecorder should check the router's `allow_migrate()` method before creating tables\n- If `allow_migrate()` returns False for a database, no migration table should be created there\n\n**Key Methods to Examine**:\n1. `ensure_schema()` - likely needs to check `allow_migrate()` before creating table\n2. `record_applied()` - calls `ensure_schema()`, may need router checks\n3. `record_unapplied()` - probably has similar issues\n4. `applied_migrations()` - may also need router checks\n\nLet me examine the MigrationRecorder's `ensure_schema()` method more closely to see how it currently works and where the router check should be added.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 40, \"end_line\": 80 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 40-80:\n\n  40:                 def __str__(self):\n  41:                     return 'Migration %s for %s' % (self.name, self.app)\n  42: \n  43:             cls._migration_class = Migration\n  44:         return cls._migration_class\n  45: \n  46:     def __init__(self, connection):\n  47:         self.connection = connection\n  48: \n  49:     @property\n  50:     def migration_qs(self):\n  51:         return self.Migration.objects.using(self.connection.alias)\n  52: \n  53:     def has_table(self):\n  54:         \"\"\"Return True if the django_migrations table exists.\"\"\"\n  55:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n  56:             tables = self.connection.introspection.table_names(cursor)\n  57:         return self.Migration._meta.db_table in tables\n  58: \n  59:     def ensure_schema(self):\n  60:         \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n  61:         #

What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in a Django project related to the MigrationRecorder class and database routing functionality.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality that may be related to the bug\n\n### Pending Investigation:\n1. 🔍 **Need to examine the complete `test_migrate_record_replaced` test** to understand the expected behavior\n2. 🔍 **Need to investigate database routing integration** with MigrationRecorder\n3. 🔍 **Need to identify the specific bug** - likely related to how `ensure_schema()` or `record_applied()` interacts with database routers\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n\n### Database Routing Context:\n- Multiple router classes found that implement `allow_migrate()` method\n- Routers can return `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n- The bug likely involves how MigrationRecorder respects router decisions\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Read the complete failing test** to understand the expected behavior\n2. **Examine how database routers should interact** with MigrationRecorder methods\n3. **Identify the specific bug** - likely in `ensure_schema()` or `record_applied()` not respecting router `allow_migrate()` decisions\n4. **Implement the fix** to ensure MigrationRecorder respects database routing rules\n5. **Verify the fix** by running the failing test\n\nThe investigation suggests the bug is related to MigrationRecorder not properly checking database router `allow_migrate()` permissions before creating tables or recording migrations.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me look at the specific test that's failing to understand the expected behavior better:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"allow_migrate\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'allow_migrate' in directory (showing first 11 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py\nLines 1152-1158:\n1152:                 #

Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\n**The Bug**: MigrationRecorder does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules when creating the django_migrations table.\n\n**Current Behavior**: \n- When `record_applied()` is called, it first calls `ensure_schema()`\n- `ensure_schema()` creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist\n- This happens regardless of what the database router's `allow_migrate()` method returns\n- So even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n- MigrationRecorder should check the router's `allow_migrate()` method before creating tables\n- If `allow_migrate()` returns False for a database, no migration table should be created there\n\n**Key Methods to Examine**:\n1. `ensure_schema()` - likely needs to check `allow_migrate()` before creating table\n2. `record_applied()` - calls `ensure_schema()`, may need router checks\n3. `record_unapplied()` - probably has similar issues\n4. `applied_migrations()` - may also need router checks\n\nLet me examine the MigrationRecorder's `ensure_schema()` method more closely to see how it currently works and where the router check should be added.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 40, \"end_line\": 80 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 40-80:\n\n  40:                 def __str__(self):\n  41:                     return 'Migration %s for %s' % (self.name, self.app)\n  42: \n  43:             cls._migration_class = Migration\n  44:         return cls._migration_class\n  45: \n  46:     def __init__(self, connection):\n  47:         self.connection = connection\n  48: \n  49:     @property\n  50:     def migration_qs(self):\n  51:         return self.Migration.objects.using(self.connection.alias)\n  52: \n  53:     def has_table(self):\n  54:         \"\"\"Return True if the django_migrations table exists.\"\"\"\n  55:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n  56:             tables = self.connection.introspection.table_names(cursor)\n  57:         return self.Migration._meta.db_table in tables\n  58: \n  59:     def ensure_schema(self):\n  60:         \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n  61:         #

We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality that may be related to the bug\n\n### Pending Investigation:\n1. 🔍 **Need to examine the complete `test_migrate_record_replaced` test** to understand the expected behavior\n2. 🔍 **Need to investigate database routing integration** with MigrationRecorder\n3. 🔍 **Need to identify the specific bug** - likely related to how `ensure_schema()` or `record_applied()` interacts with database routers\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n\n### Database Routing Context:\n- Multiple router classes found that implement `allow_migrate()` method\n- Routers can return `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n- The bug likely involves how MigrationRecorder respects router decisions\n\n## Next Steps Required\n\n1. **Read the complete failing test** to understand the expected behavior\n2. **Examine how database routers should interact** with MigrationRecorder methods\n3. **Identify the specific bug** - likely in `ensure_schema()` or `record_applied()` not respecting router `allow_migrate()` decisions\n4. **Implement the fix** to ensure MigrationRecorder respects database routing rules\n5. **Verify the fix** by running the failing test\n\nThe investigation suggests the bug is related to MigrationRecorder not properly checking database router `allow_migrate()` permissions before creating tables or recording migrations.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: Now let me look at the specific test that's failing to understand the expected behavior better:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"allow_migrate\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'allow_migrate' in directory (showing first 11 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py\nLines 1152-1158:\n1152:                 #

Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\n**The Bug**: MigrationRecorder does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules when creating the django_migrations table.\n\n**Current Behavior**: \n- When `record_applied()` is called, it first calls `ensure_schema()`\n- `ensure_schema()` creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist\n- This happens regardless of what the database router's `allow_migrate()` method returns\n- So even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n- MigrationRecorder should check the router's `allow_migrate()` method before creating tables\n- If `allow_migrate()` returns False for a database, no migration table should be created there\n\n**Key Methods to Examine**:\n1. `ensure_schema()` - likely needs to check `allow_migrate()` before creating table\n2. `record_applied()` - calls `ensure_schema()`, may need router checks\n3. `record_unapplied()` - probably has similar issues\n4. `applied_migrations()` - may also need router checks\n\nLet me examine the MigrationRecorder's `ensure_schema()` method more closely to see how it currently works and where the router check should be added.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 40, \"end_line\": 80 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nTotal lines: 96\nShowing lines 40-80:\n\n  40:                 def __str__(self):\n  41:                     return 'Migration %s for %s' % (self.name, self.app)\n  42: \n  43:             cls._migration_class = Migration\n  44:         return cls._migration_class\n  45: \n  46:     def __init__(self, connection):\n  47:         self.connection = connection\n  48: \n  49:     @property\n  50:     def migration_qs(self):\n  51:         return self.Migration.objects.using(self.connection.alias)\n  52: \n  53:     def has_table(self):\n  54:         \"\"\"Return True if the django_migrations table exists.\"\"\"\n  55:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n  56:             tables = self.connection.introspection.table_names(cursor)\n  57:         return self.Migration._meta.db_table in tables\n  58: \n  59:     def ensure_schema(self):\n  60:         \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n  61:         #

    "response": "# Django Migration Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in a Django project related to the MigrationRecorder class and database routing functionality.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n### 5. Database Router Pattern Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: Multiple searches for \"allow_migrate\" patterns across Django codebase\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Database routers implement `allow_migrate(db, app_label, **hints)` method\n  - Returns `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n  - Standard pattern: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found routers in `/tests/migrations/test_multidb.py`:\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `None` (no opinion)\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `False` (don't migrate)\n    - `AlwaysMigrateRouter`: returns `True` (always migrate)\n    - `HintMigrateRouter`: returns based on hints\n\n### 6. Failing Test Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on test `test_migrate_record_replaced` (lines 903-924)\n- **Test Purpose**: Verifies that running a squashed migration records all original replaced migrations as run\n- **Test Flow**:\n  1. Creates MigrationRecorder instance\n  2. Calls `migrate` command\n  3. Verifies applied migrations are recorded correctly\n  4. Checks that both original and squashed migrations are marked as applied\n\n### 7. MigrationRecorder Implementation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `ensure_schema()` method (lines 59-70)\n- **Current Implementation**:\n  ```python\n  def ensure_schema(self):\n      \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n      if self.has_table():\n          return\n      # Make the table\n      try:\n          with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n              editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n      except DatabaseError as exc:\n          raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n  ```\n\n### 8. Router Usage Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for router import and usage patterns\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Standard import: `from django.db import router`\n  - Typical usage: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found examples in migration operations showing proper router checking before database operations\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### **Root Cause**: \nThe `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method **does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules** when creating the `django_migrations` table.\n\n### **Current Problematic Behavior**:\n1. `record_applied()` calls `ensure_schema()`\n2. `ensure_schema()` creates the `django_migrations` table without checking routers\n3. This happens regardless of what `router.allow_migrate()` returns\n4. Even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n### **Expected Behavior**:\n1. Before creating the `django_migrations` table, check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. If router returns `False`, skip table creation\n3. Respect router decisions for all MigrationRecorder operations\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist (**BUG HERE**)\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n- `applied_migrations()`: Returns applied migrations (may also need router checks)\n\n### Router Integration Pattern:\n- Import: `from django.db import router`\n- Check: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n- For MigrationRecorder, app_label should likely be the app being migrated\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality and usage patterns\n5. ✅ **Identified the specific bug**: `ensure_schema()` doesn't check `router.allow_migrate()`\n6. ✅ Analyzed router usage patterns across Django codebase\n7. ✅ Understood the expected behavior from test analysis\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. 🔧 **Implement the fix** in `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` to check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. 🔧 **Review other MigrationRecorder methods** (`record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, `applied_migrations`) for similar issues\n3. 🧪 **Test the fix** by running the failing test\n4. 🧪 **Verify no regressions** by running related migration tests\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe fix should modify `ensure_schema()` to:\n1. Import router: `from django.db import router`\n2. Check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label)` before creating table\n3. Skip table creation if router returns `False`\n4. Need to determine appropriate `app_label` parameter (likely from migration context)\n\nThe investigation is now complete and ready for implementation of the fix.",

Database Router Pattern Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: Multiple searches for \"allow_migrate\" patterns across Django codebase\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Database routers implement `allow_migrate(db, app_label, **hints)` method\n  - Returns `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n  - Standard pattern: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found routers in `/tests/migrations/test_multidb.py`:\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `None` (no opinion)\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `False` (don't migrate)\n    - `AlwaysMigrateRouter`: returns `True` (always migrate)\n    - `HintMigrateRouter`: returns based on hints\n\n### 6. Failing Test Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on test `test_migrate_record_replaced` (lines 903-924)\n- **Test Purpose**: Verifies that running a squashed migration records all original replaced migrations as run\n- **Test Flow**:\n  1. Creates MigrationRecorder instance\n  2. Calls `migrate` command\n  3. Verifies applied migrations are recorded correctly\n  4. Checks that both original and squashed migrations are marked as applied\n\n### 7. MigrationRecorder Implementation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `ensure_schema()` method (lines 59-70)\n- **Current Implementation**:\n  ```python\n  def ensure_schema(self):\n      \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n      if self.has_table():\n          return\n      # Make the table\n      try:\n          with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n              editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n      except DatabaseError as exc:\n          raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n  ```\n\n### 8. Router Usage Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for router import and usage patterns\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Standard import: `from django.db import router`\n  - Typical usage: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found examples in migration operations showing proper router checking before database operations\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### **Root Cause**: \nThe `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method **does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules** when creating the `django_migrations` table.\n\n### **Current Problematic Behavior**:\n1. `record_applied()` calls `ensure_schema()`\n2. `ensure_schema()` creates the `django_migrations` table without checking routers\n3. This happens regardless of what `router.allow_migrate()` returns\n4. Even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n### **Expected Behavior**:\n1. Before creating the `django_migrations` table, check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. If router returns `False`, skip table creation\n3. Respect router decisions for all MigrationRecorder operations\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist (**BUG HERE**)\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n- `applied_migrations()`: Returns applied migrations (may also need router checks)\n\n### Router Integration Pattern:\n- Import: `from django.db import router`\n- Check: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n- For MigrationRecorder, app_label should likely be the app being migrated\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality and usage patterns\n5. ✅ **Identified the specific bug**: `ensure_schema()` doesn't check `router.allow_migrate()`\n6. ✅ Analyzed router usage patterns across Django codebase\n7. ✅ Understood the expected behavior from test analysis\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. 🔧 **Implement the fix** in `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` to check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. 🔧 **Review other MigrationRecorder methods** (`record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, `applied_migrations`) for similar issues\n3. 🧪 **Test the fix** by running the failing test\n4. 🧪 **Verify no regressions** by running related migration tests\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe fix should modify `ensure_schema()` to:\n1. Import router: `from django.db import router`\n2. Check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label)` before creating table\n3. Skip table creation if router returns `False`\n4. Need to determine appropriate `app_label` parameter (likely from migration context)\n\nThe investigation is now complete and ready for implementation of the fix.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine how the router's `allow_migrate` method should be called by looking at existing patterns in Django:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 30 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\nTotal lines: 140\nShowing lines 1-30:\n\n   1: from django.db import router\n   2: \n   3: \n   4: class Operation:\n   5:     \"\"\"\n   6:     Base class for migration operations.\n   7: \n   8:     It's responsible for both mutating the in-memory model state\n   9:     (see db/migrations/state.py) to represent what it performs, as well\n  10:     as actually performing it against a live database.\n  11: \n  12:     Note that some operations won't modify memory state at all (e.g. data\n  13:     copying operations), and some will need their modifications to be\n  14:     optionally specified by the user (e.g. custom Python code snippets)\n  15: \n  16:     Due to the way this class deals with deconstruction, it should be\n  17:     considered immutable.\n  18:     \"\"\"\n  19: \n  20:     # If this migration can be run in reverse.\n  21:     # Some operations are impossible to reverse, like deleting data.\n  22:     reversible = True\n  23: \n  24:     # Can this migration be represented as SQL?

What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nBased on the search results, I can see the pattern for how `router.allow_migrate` is called throughout Django's migration system:\n\n1. **Standard pattern**: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n2. **Key parameters**:\n   - `connection.alias` - the database alias (e.g., 'default', 'other_db')\n   - `app_label` - the Django app label \n   - `**hints` - optional hints like model_name\n\nFrom the problem description, I now understand the exact issue:\n\n**The Bug**: `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` creates the `django_migrations` table without checking if the database router allows migrations on that database connection. This violates the router's `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n**Expected Behavior**: Before creating the `django_migrations` table, MigrationRecorder should check `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label)` and only create the table if the router allows it.\n\nNow I need to examine the current `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method to understand exactly what needs to be fixed, and then look at how to determine the appropriate `app_label` to pass to the router.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"start_line\": 59, \"end_line\": 75 }",

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4.

What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in a Django project related to the MigrationRecorder class and database routing functionality.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n### 5. Database Router Pattern Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: Multiple searches for \"allow_migrate\" patterns across Django codebase\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Database routers implement `allow_migrate(db, app_label, **hints)` method\n  - Returns `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n  - Standard pattern: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found routers in `/tests/migrations/test_multidb.py`:\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `None` (no opinion)\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `False` (don't migrate)\n    - `AlwaysMigrateRouter`: returns `True` (always migrate)\n    - `HintMigrateRouter`: returns based on hints\n\n### 6. Failing Test Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on test `test_migrate_record_replaced` (lines 903-924)\n- **Test Purpose**: Verifies that running a squashed migration records all original replaced migrations as run\n- **Test Flow**:\n  1. Creates MigrationRecorder instance\n  2. Calls `migrate` command\n  3. Verifies applied migrations are recorded correctly\n  4. Checks that both original and squashed migrations are marked as applied\n\n### 7. MigrationRecorder Implementation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `ensure_schema()` method (lines 59-70)\n- **Current Implementation**:\n  ```python\n  def ensure_schema(self):\n      \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n      if self.has_table():\n          return\n      # Make the table\n      try:\n          with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n              editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n      except DatabaseError as exc:\n          raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n  ```\n\n### 8. Router Usage Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for router import and usage patterns\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Standard import: `from django.db import router`\n  - Typical usage: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found examples in migration operations showing proper router checking before database operations\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### **Root Cause**: \nThe `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method **does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules** when creating the `django_migrations` table.\n\n### **Current Problematic Behavior**:\n1. `record_applied()` calls `ensure_schema()`\n2. `ensure_schema()` creates the `django_migrations` table without checking routers\n3. This happens regardless of what `router.allow_migrate()` returns\n4. Even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n### **Expected Behavior**:\n1. Before creating the `django_migrations` table, check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. If router returns `False`, skip table creation\n3. Respect router decisions for all MigrationRecorder operations\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist (**BUG HERE**)\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n- `applied_migrations()`: Returns applied migrations (may also need router checks)\n\n### Router Integration Pattern:\n- Import: `from django.db import router`\n- Check: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n- For MigrationRecorder, app_label should likely be the app being migrated\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality and usage patterns\n5. ✅ **Identified the specific bug**: `ensure_schema()` doesn't check `router.allow_migrate()`\n6. ✅ Analyzed router usage patterns across Django codebase\n7. ✅ Understood the expected behavior from test analysis\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. 🔧 **Implement the fix** in `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` to check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. 🔧 **Review other MigrationRecorder methods** (`record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, `applied_migrations`) for similar issues\n3. 🧪 **Test the fix** by running the failing test\n4. 🧪 **Verify no regressions** by running related migration tests\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe fix should modify `ensure_schema()` to:\n1. Import router: `from django.db import router`\n2. Check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label)` before creating table\n3. Skip table creation if router returns `False`\n4. Need to determine appropriate `app_label` parameter (likely from migration context)\n\nThe investigation is now complete and ready for implementation of the fix.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine how the router's `allow_migrate` method should be called by looking at existing patterns in Django:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 30 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\nTotal lines: 140\nShowing lines 1-30:\n\n   1: from django.db import router\n   2: \n   3: \n   4: class Operation:\n   5:     \"\"\"\n   6:     Base class for migration operations.\n   7: \n   8:     It's responsible for both mutating the in-memory model state\n   9:     (see db/migrations/state.py) to represent what it performs, as well\n  10:     as actually performing it against a live database.\n  11: \n  12:     Note that some operations won't modify memory state at all (e.g. data\n  13:     copying operations), and some will need their modifications to be\n  14:     optionally specified by the user (e.g. custom Python code snippets)\n  15: \n  16:     Due to the way this class deals with deconstruction, it should be\n  17:     considered immutable.\n  18:     \"\"\"\n  19: \n  20:     # If this migration can be run in reverse.\n  21:     # Some operations are impossible to reverse, like deleting data.\n  22:     reversible = True\n  23: \n  24:     # Can this migration be represented as SQL?

What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in a Django project related to the MigrationRecorder class and database routing functionality.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n### 5. Database Router Pattern Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: Multiple searches for \"allow_migrate\" patterns across Django codebase\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Database routers implement `allow_migrate(db, app_label, **hints)` method\n  - Returns `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n  - Standard pattern: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found routers in `/tests/migrations/test_multidb.py`:\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `None` (no opinion)\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `False` (don't migrate)\n    - `AlwaysMigrateRouter`: returns `True` (always migrate)\n    - `HintMigrateRouter`: returns based on hints\n\n### 6. Failing Test Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on test `test_migrate_record_replaced` (lines 903-924)\n- **Test Purpose**: Verifies that running a squashed migration records all original replaced migrations as run\n- **Test Flow**:\n  1. Creates MigrationRecorder instance\n  2. Calls `migrate` command\n  3. Verifies applied migrations are recorded correctly\n  4. Checks that both original and squashed migrations are marked as applied\n\n### 7. MigrationRecorder Implementation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `ensure_schema()` method (lines 59-70)\n- **Current Implementation**:\n  ```python\n  def ensure_schema(self):\n      \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n      if self.has_table():\n          return\n      # Make the table\n      try:\n          with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n              editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n      except DatabaseError as exc:\n          raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n  ```\n\n### 8. Router Usage Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for router import and usage patterns\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Standard import: `from django.db import router`\n  - Typical usage: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found examples in migration operations showing proper router checking before database operations\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### **Root Cause**: \nThe `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method **does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules** when creating the `django_migrations` table.\n\n### **Current Problematic Behavior**:\n1. `record_applied()` calls `ensure_schema()`\n2. `ensure_schema()` creates the `django_migrations` table without checking routers\n3. This happens regardless of what `router.allow_migrate()` returns\n4. Even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n### **Expected Behavior**:\n1. Before creating the `django_migrations` table, check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. If router returns `False`, skip table creation\n3. Respect router decisions for all MigrationRecorder operations\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist (**BUG HERE**)\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n- `applied_migrations()`: Returns applied migrations (may also need router checks)\n\n### Router Integration Pattern:\n- Import: `from django.db import router`\n- Check: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n- For MigrationRecorder, app_label should likely be the app being migrated\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality and usage patterns\n5. ✅ **Identified the specific bug**: `ensure_schema()` doesn't check `router.allow_migrate()`\n6. ✅ Analyzed router usage patterns across Django codebase\n7. ✅ Understood the expected behavior from test analysis\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. 🔧 **Implement the fix** in `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` to check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. 🔧 **Review other MigrationRecorder methods** (`record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, `applied_migrations`) for similar issues\n3. 🧪 **Test the fix** by running the failing test\n4. 🧪 **Verify no regressions** by running related migration tests\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe fix should modify `ensure_schema()` to:\n1. Import router: `from django.db import router`\n2. Check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label)` before creating table\n3. Skip table creation if router returns `False`\n4. Need to determine appropriate `app_label` parameter (likely from migration context)\n\nThe investigation is now complete and ready for implementation of the fix.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine how the router's `allow_migrate` method should be called by looking at existing patterns in Django:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 30 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\nTotal lines: 140\nShowing lines 1-30:\n\n   1: from django.db import router\n   2: \n   3: \n   4: class Operation:\n   5:     \"\"\"\n   6:     Base class for migration operations.\n   7: \n   8:     It's responsible for both mutating the in-memory model state\n   9:     (see db/migrations/state.py) to represent what it performs, as well\n  10:     as actually performing it against a live database.\n  11: \n  12:     Note that some operations won't modify memory state at all (e.g. data\n  13:     copying operations), and some will need their modifications to be\n  14:     optionally specified by the user (e.g. custom Python code snippets)\n  15: \n  16:     Due to the way this class deals with deconstruction, it should be\n  17:     considered immutable.\n  18:     \"\"\"\n  19: \n  20:     # If this migration can be run in reverse.\n  21:     # Some operations are impossible to reverse, like deleting data.\n  22:     reversible = True\n  23: \n  24:     # Can this migration be represented as SQL?

What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in a Django project related to the MigrationRecorder class and database routing functionality.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n### 5. Database Router Pattern Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: Multiple searches for \"allow_migrate\" patterns across Django codebase\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Database routers implement `allow_migrate(db, app_label, **hints)` method\n  - Returns `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n  - Standard pattern: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found routers in `/tests/migrations/test_multidb.py`:\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `None` (no opinion)\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `False` (don't migrate)\n    - `AlwaysMigrateRouter`: returns `True` (always migrate)\n    - `HintMigrateRouter`: returns based on hints\n\n### 6. Failing Test Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on test `test_migrate_record_replaced` (lines 903-924)\n- **Test Purpose**: Verifies that running a squashed migration records all original replaced migrations as run\n- **Test Flow**:\n  1. Creates MigrationRecorder instance\n  2. Calls `migrate` command\n  3. Verifies applied migrations are recorded correctly\n  4. Checks that both original and squashed migrations are marked as applied\n\n### 7. MigrationRecorder Implementation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `ensure_schema()` method (lines 59-70)\n- **Current Implementation**:\n  ```python\n  def ensure_schema(self):\n      \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n      if self.has_table():\n          return\n      # Make the table\n      try:\n          with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n              editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n      except DatabaseError as exc:\n          raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n  ```\n\n### 8. Router Usage Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for router import and usage patterns\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Standard import: `from django.db import router`\n  - Typical usage: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found examples in migration operations showing proper router checking before database operations\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### **Root Cause**: \nThe `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method **does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules** when creating the `django_migrations` table.\n\n### **Current Problematic Behavior**:\n1. `record_applied()` calls `ensure_schema()`\n2. `ensure_schema()` creates the `django_migrations` table without checking routers\n3. This happens regardless of what `router.allow_migrate()` returns\n4. Even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n### **Expected Behavior**:\n1. Before creating the `django_migrations` table, check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. If router returns `False`, skip table creation\n3. Respect router decisions for all MigrationRecorder operations\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist (**BUG HERE**)\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n- `applied_migrations()`: Returns applied migrations (may also need router checks)\n\n### Router Integration Pattern:\n- Import: `from django.db import router`\n- Check: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n- For MigrationRecorder, app_label should likely be the app being migrated\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality and usage patterns\n5. ✅ **Identified the specific bug**: `ensure_schema()` doesn't check `router.allow_migrate()`\n6. ✅ Analyzed router usage patterns across Django codebase\n7. ✅ Understood the expected behavior from test analysis\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. 🔧 **Implement the fix** in `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` to check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. 🔧 **Review other MigrationRecorder methods** (`record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, `applied_migrations`) for similar issues\n3. 🧪 **Test the fix** by running the failing test\n4. 🧪 **Verify no regressions** by running related migration tests\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe fix should modify `ensure_schema()` to:\n1. Import router: `from django.db import router`\n2. Check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label)` before creating table\n3. Skip table creation if router returns `False`\n4. Need to determine appropriate `app_label` parameter (likely from migration context)\n\nThe investigation is now complete and ready for implementation of the fix.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine how the router's `allow_migrate` method should be called by looking at existing patterns in Django:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 30 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\nTotal lines: 140\nShowing lines 1-30:\n\n   1: from django.db import router\n   2: \n   3: \n   4: class Operation:\n   5:     \"\"\"\n   6:     Base class for migration operations.\n   7: \n   8:     It's responsible for both mutating the in-memory model state\n   9:     (see db/migrations/state.py) to represent what it performs, as well\n  10:     as actually performing it against a live database.\n  11: \n  12:     Note that some operations won't modify memory state at all (e.g. data\n  13:     copying operations), and some will need their modifications to be\n  14:     optionally specified by the user (e.g. custom Python code snippets)\n  15: \n  16:     Due to the way this class deals with deconstruction, it should be\n  17:     considered immutable.\n  18:     \"\"\"\n  19: \n  20:     # If this migration can be run in reverse.\n  21:     # Some operations are impossible to reverse, like deleting data.\n  22:     reversible = True\n  23: \n  24:     # Can this migration be represented as SQL?

What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and the exact locations that need to be fixed. Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**The Bug**: The `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method creates the `django_migrations` table without checking database router rules via `router.allow_migrate()`. This violates multi-database setups where certain databases should not have Django tables created on them.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis**:\n1. When `record_applied(app, name)` is called (lines 84-87), it calls `ensure_schema()` first\n2. `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70) creates the `django_migrations` table without any router checks\n3. The same issue exists in `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92) which also calls `ensure_schema()`\n4. From the search results, I can see that `record_applied()` is called with `app_label` parameter from the migration executor\n\n**Key Locations to Fix**:\n\n1. **Primary Location**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` lines 59-70 (`ensure_schema` method)\n   - This is where the table creation happens without router checks\n   - Need to add `router.allow_migrate()` check before creating the table\n\n2. **Secondary Locations**: Lines 84-87 (`record_applied`) and lines 89-92 (`record_unapplied`)\n   - These methods call `ensure_schema()` and should also respect router rules\n   - May need additional router checks here as well\n\n3. **Import Location**: Lines 1-6 (imports section)\n   - Need to add `from django.db import router` import\n\n**The Fix Strategy**:\n- Import `router` from `django.db`\n- Modify `ensure_schema()` to check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label)` before creating table\n- The `app_label` parameter needs to be passed to `ensure_schema()` from the calling methods\n- If router returns `False`, skip table creation entirely\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nI have identified the precise locations where the bug exists:\n\n1. **Lines 59-70**: `ensure_schema()` method - primary bug location where table creation ignores router rules\n2. **Lines 84-87**: `record_applied()` method - calls ensure_schema without router context  \n3. **Lines 89-92**: `record_unapplied()` method - calls ensure_schema without router context\n4. **Lines 1-6**: Import section - needs router import added\n5. **Lines 72-82**: `applied_migrations()` method - may also need router checks for consistency",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in a Django project related to the MigrationRecorder class and database routing functionality.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n### 5. Database Router Pattern Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: Multiple searches for \"allow_migrate\" patterns across Django codebase\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Database routers implement `allow_migrate(db, app_label, **hints)` method\n  - Returns `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n  - Standard pattern: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found routers in `/tests/migrations/test_multidb.py`:\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `None` (no opinion)\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `False` (don't migrate)\n    - `AlwaysMigrateRouter`: returns `True` (always migrate)\n    - `HintMigrateRouter`: returns based on hints\n\n### 6. Failing Test Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on test `test_migrate_record_replaced` (lines 903-924)\n- **Test Purpose**: Verifies that running a squashed migration records all original replaced migrations as run\n- **Test Flow**:\n  1. Creates MigrationRecorder instance\n  2. Calls `migrate` command\n  3. Verifies applied migrations are recorded correctly\n  4. Checks that both original and squashed migrations are marked as applied\n\n### 7. MigrationRecorder Implementation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `ensure_schema()` method (lines 59-70)\n- **Current Implementation**:\n  ```python\n  def ensure_schema(self):\n      \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n      if self.has_table():\n          return\n      # Make the table\n      try:\n          with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n              editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n      except DatabaseError as exc:\n          raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n  ```\n\n### 8. Router Usage Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for router import and usage patterns\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Standard import: `from django.db import router`\n  - Typical usage: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found examples in migration operations showing proper router checking before database operations\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### **Root Cause**: \nThe `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method **does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules** when creating the `django_migrations` table.\n\n### **Current Problematic Behavior**:\n1. `record_applied()` calls `ensure_schema()`\n2. `ensure_schema()` creates the `django_migrations` table without checking routers\n3. This happens regardless of what `router.allow_migrate()` returns\n4. Even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n### **Expected Behavior**:\n1. Before creating the `django_migrations` table, check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. If router returns `False`, skip table creation\n3. Respect router decisions for all MigrationRecorder operations\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist (**BUG HERE**)\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n- `applied_migrations()`: Returns applied migrations (may also need router checks)\n\n### Router Integration Pattern:\n- Import: `from django.db import router`\n- Check: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n- For MigrationRecorder, app_label should likely be the app being migrated\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality and usage patterns\n5. ✅ **Identified the specific bug**: `ensure_schema()` doesn't check `router.allow_migrate()`\n6. ✅ Analyzed router usage patterns across Django codebase\n7. ✅ Understood the expected behavior from test analysis\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. 🔧 **Implement the fix** in `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` to check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. 🔧 **Review other MigrationRecorder methods** (`record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, `applied_migrations`) for similar issues\n3. 🧪 **Test the fix** by running the failing test\n4. 🧪 **Verify no regressions** by running related migration tests\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe fix should modify `ensure_schema()` to:\n1. Import router: `from django.db import router`\n2. Check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label)` before creating table\n3. Skip table creation if router returns `False`\n4. Need to determine appropriate `app_label` parameter (likely from migration context)\n\nThe investigation is now complete and ready for implementation of the fix.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine how the router's `allow_migrate` method should be called by looking at existing patterns in Django:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 30 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\nTotal lines: 140\nShowing lines 1-30:\n\n   1: from django.db import router\n   2: \n   3: \n   4: class Operation:\n   5:     \"\"\"\n   6:     Base class for migration operations.\n   7: \n   8:     It's responsible for both mutating the in-memory model state\n   9:     (see db/migrations/state.py) to represent what it performs, as well\n  10:     as actually performing it against a live database.\n  11: \n  12:     Note that some operations won't modify memory state at all (e.g. data\n  13:     copying operations), and some will need their modifications to be\n  14:     optionally specified by the user (e.g. custom Python code snippets)\n  15: \n  16:     Due to the way this class deals with deconstruction, it should be\n  17:     considered immutable.\n  18:     \"\"\"\n  19: \n  20:     # If this migration can be run in reverse.\n  21:     # Some operations are impossible to reverse, like deleting data.\n  22:     reversible = True\n  23: \n  24:     # Can this migration be represented as SQL?

Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**The Bug**: The `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method creates the `django_migrations` table without checking database router rules via `router.allow_migrate()`. This violates multi-database setups where certain databases should not have Django tables created on them.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis**:\n1. When `record_applied(app, name)` is called (lines 84-87), it calls `ensure_schema()` first\n2. `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70) creates the `django_migrations` table without any router checks\n3. The same issue exists in `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92) which also calls `ensure_schema()`\n4. From the search results, I can see that `record_applied()` is called with `app_label` parameter from the migration executor\n\n**Key Locations to Fix**:\n\n1. **Primary Location**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` lines 59-70 (`ensure_schema` method)\n   - This is where the table creation happens without router checks\n   - Need to add `router.allow_migrate()` check before creating the table\n\n2. **Secondary Locations**: Lines 84-87 (`record_applied`) and lines 89-92 (`record_unapplied`)\n   - These methods call `ensure_schema()` and should also respect router rules\n   - May need additional router checks here as well\n\n3. **Import Location**: Lines 1-6 (imports section)\n   - Need to add `from django.db import router` import\n\n**The Fix Strategy**:\n- Import `router` from `django.db`\n- Modify `ensure_schema()` to check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label)` before creating table\n- The `app_label` parameter needs to be passed to `ensure_schema()` from the calling methods\n- If router returns `False`, skip table creation entirely\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nI have identified the precise locations where the bug exists:\n\n1. **Lines 59-70**: `ensure_schema()` method - primary bug location where table creation ignores router rules\n2. **Lines 84-87**: `record_applied()` method - calls ensure_schema without router context  \n3. **Lines 89-92**: `record_unapplied()` method - calls ensure_schema without router context\n4. **Lines 1-6**: Import section - needs router import added\n5. **Lines 72-82**: `applied_migrations()` method - may also need router checks for consistency\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list. It must follow the following structure:  example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/viewcode.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 181,\n            \"end_line\": 276\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/viewcode.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 160,\n            \"end_line\": 178\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n                ",
    "response": "PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the problem description and codebase investigation, I have identified the root cause and specific locations where the MigrationRecorder violates database router `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n**Root Cause**: The `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method creates the `django_migrations` table without checking if the database router allows migrations on that database connection. This causes Django to create tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids it (returning `False` from `allow_migrate`).\n\n**Key Issue**: When `record_applied()` is called, it immediately calls `ensure_schema()` which creates the table regardless of router rules. The same pattern exists in `record_unapplied()`.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 59,\n            \"end_line\": 70\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 84,\n            \"end_line\": 87\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 89,\n            \"end_line\": 92\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1,\n            \"end_line\": 6\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 72,\n            \"end_line\": 82\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in a Django project related to the MigrationRecorder class and database routing functionality.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n### 5. Database Router Pattern Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: Multiple searches for \"allow_migrate\" patterns across Django codebase\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Database routers implement `allow_migrate(db, app_label, **hints)` method\n  - Returns `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n  - Standard pattern: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found routers in `/tests/migrations/test_multidb.py`:\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `None` (no opinion)\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `False` (don't migrate)\n    - `AlwaysMigrateRouter`: returns `True` (always migrate)\n    - `HintMigrateRouter`: returns based on hints\n\n### 6. Failing Test Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on test `test_migrate_record_replaced` (lines 903-924)\n- **Test Purpose**: Verifies that running a squashed migration records all original replaced migrations as run\n- **Test Flow**:\n  1. Creates MigrationRecorder instance\n  2. Calls `migrate` command\n  3. Verifies applied migrations are recorded correctly\n  4. Checks that both original and squashed migrations are marked as applied\n\n### 7. MigrationRecorder Implementation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `ensure_schema()` method (lines 59-70)\n- **Current Implementation**:\n  ```python\n  def ensure_schema(self):\n      \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n      if self.has_table():\n          return\n      # Make the table\n      try:\n          with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n              editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n      except DatabaseError as exc:\n          raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n  ```\n\n### 8. Router Usage Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for router import and usage patterns\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Standard import: `from django.db import router`\n  - Typical usage: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found examples in migration operations showing proper router checking before database operations\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### **Root Cause**: \nThe `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method **does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules** when creating the `django_migrations` table.\n\n### **Current Problematic Behavior**:\n1. `record_applied()` calls `ensure_schema()`\n2. `ensure_schema()` creates the `django_migrations` table without checking routers\n3. This happens regardless of what `router.allow_migrate()` returns\n4. Even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n### **Expected Behavior**:\n1. Before creating the `django_migrations` table, check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. If router returns `False`, skip table creation\n3. Respect router decisions for all MigrationRecorder operations\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist (**BUG HERE**)\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n- `applied_migrations()`: Returns applied migrations (may also need router checks)\n\n### Router Integration Pattern:\n- Import: `from django.db import router`\n- Check: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n- For MigrationRecorder, app_label should likely be the app being migrated\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality and usage patterns\n5. ✅ **Identified the specific bug**: `ensure_schema()` doesn't check `router.allow_migrate()`\n6. ✅ Analyzed router usage patterns across Django codebase\n7. ✅ Understood the expected behavior from test analysis\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. 🔧 **Implement the fix** in `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` to check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. 🔧 **Review other MigrationRecorder methods** (`record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, `applied_migrations`) for similar issues\n3. 🧪 **Test the fix** by running the failing test\n4. 🧪 **Verify no regressions** by running related migration tests\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe fix should modify `ensure_schema()` to:\n1. Import router: `from django.db import router`\n2. Check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label)` before creating table\n3. Skip table creation if router returns `False`\n4. Need to determine appropriate `app_label` parameter (likely from migration context)\n\nThe investigation is now complete and ready for implementation of the fix.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 59\nEnd line: 70\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 84\nEnd line: 87\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 89\nEnd line: 92\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 1\nEnd line: 6\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\nStart line: 72\nEnd line: 82\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me examine how the router's `allow_migrate` method should be called by looking at existing patterns in Django:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 30 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\nTotal lines: 140\nShowing lines 1-30:\n\n   1: from django.db import router\n   2: \n   3: \n   4: class Operation:\n   5:     \"\"\"\n   6:     Base class for migration operations.\n   7: \n   8:     It's responsible for both mutating the in-memory model state\n   9:     (see db/migrations/state.py) to represent what it performs, as well\n  10:     as actually performing it against a live database.\n  11: \n  12:     Note that some operations won't modify memory state at all (e.g. data\n  13:     copying operations), and some will need their modifications to be\n  14:     optionally specified by the user (e.g. custom Python code snippets)\n  15: \n  16:     Due to the way this class deals with deconstruction, it should be\n  17:     considered immutable.\n  18:     \"\"\"\n  19: \n  20:     # If this migration can be run in reverse.\n  21:     # Some operations are impossible to reverse, like deleting data.\n  22:     reversible = True\n  23: \n  24:     # Can this migration be represented as SQL?

Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**The Bug**: The `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method creates the `django_migrations` table without checking database router rules via `router.allow_migrate()`. This violates multi-database setups where certain databases should not have Django tables created on them.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis**:\n1. When `record_applied(app, name)` is called (lines 84-87), it calls `ensure_schema()` first\n2. `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70) creates the `django_migrations` table without any router checks\n3. The same issue exists in `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92) which also calls `ensure_schema()`\n4. From the search results, I can see that `record_applied()` is called with `app_label` parameter from the migration executor\n\n**Key Locations to Fix**:\n\n1. **Primary Location**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` lines 59-70 (`ensure_schema` method)\n   - This is where the table creation happens without router checks\n   - Need to add `router.allow_migrate()` check before creating the table\n\n2. **Secondary Locations**: Lines 84-87 (`record_applied`) and lines 89-92 (`record_unapplied`)\n   - These methods call `ensure_schema()` and should also respect router rules\n   - May need additional router checks here as well\n\n3. **Import Location**: Lines 1-6 (imports section)\n   - Need to add `from django.db import router` import\n\n**The Fix Strategy**:\n- Import `router` from `django.db`\n- Modify `ensure_schema()` to check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label)` before creating table\n- The `app_label` parameter needs to be passed to `ensure_schema()` from the calling methods\n- If router returns `False`, skip table creation entirely\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nI have identified the precise locations where the bug exists:\n\n1. **Lines 59-70**: `ensure_schema()` method - primary bug location where table creation ignores router rules\n2. **Lines 84-87**: `record_applied()` method - calls ensure_schema without router context  \n3. **Lines 89-92**: `record_unapplied()` method - calls ensure_schema without router context\n4. **Lines 1-6**: Import section - needs router import added\n5. **Lines 72-82**: `applied_migrations()` method - may also need router checks for consistency\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the problem description and codebase investigation, I have identified the root cause and specific locations where the MigrationRecorder violates database router `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n**Root Cause**: The `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method creates the `django_migrations` table without checking if the database router allows migrations on that database connection. This causes Django to create tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids it (returning `False` from `allow_migrate`).\n\n**Key Issue**: When `record_applied()` is called, it immediately calls `ensure_schema()` which creates the table regardless of router rules. The same pattern exists in `record_unapplied()`.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 59,\n            \"end_line\": 70\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 84,\n            \"end_line\": 87\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 89,\n            \"end_line\": 92\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1,\n            \"end_line\": 6\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 72,\n            \"end_line\": 82\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",
    "response": "PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the interconnected bug locations, here are my coordinated repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Lines 1-6 - Import section]**: Add router import to enable database routing checks\n   - Add `from django.db import router` to the existing imports\n   - This provides the foundation for all other fixes to work\n\n2. **[Lines 59-70 - ensure_schema() method]**: Modify to respect router allow_migrate rules before table creation\n   - Add `app_label` parameter to method signature: `def ensure_schema(self, app_label=None):`\n   - Before creating the table, check: `if app_label and not router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label): return`\n   - This is the core fix that prevents unauthorized table creation on restricted databases\n\n3. **[Lines 84-87 - record_applied() method]**: Pass app_label context to ensure_schema()\n   - Modify call to: `self.ensure_schema(app)`\n   - This provides the necessary app context for router decision-making and coordinates with fix #2\n\n4. **[Lines 89-92 - record_unapplied() method]**: Pass app_label context to ensure_schema()\n   - Modify call to: `self.ensure_schema(app)`\n   - Maintains consistency with record_applied() and ensures both methods respect router rules\n\n5. **[Lines 72-82 - applied_migrations() method]**: Add router check for consistency\n   - Before returning migration data, verify router allows access to this database\n   - Add early return if router forbids migration operations on this connection\n   - This prevents reading migration data from databases where migrations shouldn't exist\n\nThese fixes work together as a coordinated solution: the import (#1) enables router functionality, the core logic (#2) implements the router check, the calling methods (#3, #4) provide necessary context, and the query method (#5) maintains consistency across all MigrationRecorder operations. This ensures the entire MigrationRecorder class respects the database router's allow_migrate rules.",

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Django Migration Bug Investigation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in a Django project related to the MigrationRecorder class and database routing functionality.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n### 5. Database Router Pattern Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: Multiple searches for \"allow_migrate\" patterns across Django codebase\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Database routers implement `allow_migrate(db, app_label, **hints)` method\n  - Returns `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n  - Standard pattern: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found routers in `/tests/migrations/test_multidb.py`:\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `None` (no opinion)\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `False` (don't migrate)\n    - `AlwaysMigrateRouter`: returns `True` (always migrate)\n    - `HintMigrateRouter`: returns based on hints\n\n### 6. Failing Test Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on test `test_migrate_record_replaced` (lines 903-924)\n- **Test Purpose**: Verifies that running a squashed migration records all original replaced migrations as run\n- **Test Flow**:\n  1. Creates MigrationRecorder instance\n  2. Calls `migrate` command\n  3. Verifies applied migrations are recorded correctly\n  4. Checks that both original and squashed migrations are marked as applied\n\n### 7. MigrationRecorder Implementation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `ensure_schema()` method (lines 59-70)\n- **Current Implementation**:\n  ```python\n  def ensure_schema(self):\n      \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n      if self.has_table():\n          return\n      # Make the table\n      try:\n          with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n              editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n      except DatabaseError as exc:\n          raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n  ```\n\n### 8. Router Usage Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for router import and usage patterns\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Standard import: `from django.db import router`\n  - Typical usage: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found examples in migration operations showing proper router checking before database operations\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### **Root Cause**: \nThe `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method **does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules** when creating the `django_migrations` table.\n\n### **Current Problematic Behavior**:\n1. `record_applied()` calls `ensure_schema()`\n2. `ensure_schema()` creates the `django_migrations` table without checking routers\n3. This happens regardless of what `router.allow_migrate()` returns\n4. Even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n\n### **Expected Behavior**:\n1. Before creating the `django_migrations` table, check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. If router returns `False`, skip table creation\n3. Respect router decisions for all MigrationRecorder operations\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist (**BUG HERE**)\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n- `applied_migrations()`: Returns applied migrations (may also need router checks)\n\n### Router Integration Pattern:\n- Import: `from django.db import router`\n- Check: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n- For MigrationRecorder, app_label should likely be the app being migrated\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality and usage patterns\n5. ✅ **Identified the specific bug**: `ensure_schema()` doesn't check `router.allow_migrate()`\n6. ✅ Analyzed router usage patterns across Django codebase\n7. ✅ Understood the expected behavior from test analysis\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. 🔧 **Implement the fix** in `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` to check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. 🔧 **Review other MigrationRecorder methods** (`record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, `applied_migrations`) for similar issues\n3. 🧪 **Test the fix** by running the failing test\n4. 🧪 **Verify no regressions** by running related migration tests\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nThe fix should modify `ensure_schema()` to:\n1. Import router: `from django.db import router`\n2. Check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label)` before creating table\n3. Skip table creation if router returns `False`\n4. Need to determine appropriate `app_label` parameter (likely from migration context)\n\nThe investigation is now complete and ready for implementation of the fix.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: Now let me examine how the router's `allow_migrate` method should be called by looking at existing patterns in Django:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\", \"start_line\": 1, \"end_line\": 30 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\nTotal lines: 140\nShowing lines 1-30:\n\n   1: from django.db import router\n   2: \n   3: \n   4: class Operation:\n   5:     \"\"\"\n   6:     Base class for migration operations.\n   7: \n   8:     It's responsible for both mutating the in-memory model state\n   9:     (see db/migrations/state.py) to represent what it performs, as well\n  10:     as actually performing it against a live database.\n  11: \n  12:     Note that some operations won't modify memory state at all (e.g. data\n  13:     copying operations), and some will need their modifications to be\n  14:     optionally specified by the user (e.g. custom Python code snippets)\n  15: \n  16:     Due to the way this class deals with deconstruction, it should be\n  17:     considered immutable.\n  18:     \"\"\"\n  19: \n  20:     # If this migration can be run in reverse.\n  21:     # Some operations are impossible to reverse, like deleting data.\n  22:     reversible = True\n  23: \n  24:     # Can this migration be represented as SQL?

Let me analyze what I've discovered:\n\n**The Bug**: The `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method creates the `django_migrations` table without checking database router rules via `router.allow_migrate()`. This violates multi-database setups where certain databases should not have Django tables created on them.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis**:\n1. When `record_applied(app, name)` is called (lines 84-87), it calls `ensure_schema()` first\n2. `ensure_schema()` (lines 59-70) creates the `django_migrations` table without any router checks\n3. The same issue exists in `record_unapplied()` (lines 89-92) which also calls `ensure_schema()`\n4. From the search results, I can see that `record_applied()` is called with `app_label` parameter from the migration executor\n\n**Key Locations to Fix**:\n\n1. **Primary Location**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py` lines 59-70 (`ensure_schema` method)\n   - This is where the table creation happens without router checks\n   - Need to add `router.allow_migrate()` check before creating the table\n\n2. **Secondary Locations**: Lines 84-87 (`record_applied`) and lines 89-92 (`record_unapplied`)\n   - These methods call `ensure_schema()` and should also respect router rules\n   - May need additional router checks here as well\n\n3. **Import Location**: Lines 1-6 (imports section)\n   - Need to add `from django.db import router` import\n\n**The Fix Strategy**:\n- Import `router` from `django.db`\n- Modify `ensure_schema()` to check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label)` before creating table\n- The `app_label` parameter needs to be passed to `ensure_schema()` from the calling methods\n- If router returns `False`, skip table creation entirely\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nI have identified the precise locations where the bug exists:\n\n1. **Lines 59-70**: `ensure_schema()` method - primary bug location where table creation ignores router rules\n2. **Lines 84-87**: `record_applied()` method - calls ensure_schema without router context  \n3. **Lines 89-92**: `record_unapplied()` method - calls ensure_schema without router context\n4. **Lines 1-6**: Import section - needs router import added\n5. **Lines 72-82**: `applied_migrations()` method - may also need router checks for consistency\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the problem description and codebase investigation, I have identified the root cause and specific locations where the MigrationRecorder violates database router `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n**Root Cause**: The `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method creates the `django_migrations` table without checking if the database router allows migrations on that database connection. This causes Django to create tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids it (returning `False` from `allow_migrate`).\n\n**Key Issue**: When `record_applied()` is called, it immediately calls `ensure_schema()` which creates the table regardless of router rules. The same pattern exists in `record_unapplied()`.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 59,\n            \"end_line\": 70\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 84,\n            \"end_line\": 87\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 89,\n            \"end_line\": 92\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1,\n            \"end_line\": 6\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 72,\n            \"end_line\": 82\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nAssistant: PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the interconnected bug locations, here are my coordinated repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Lines 1-6 - Import section]**: Add router import to enable database routing checks\n   - Add `from django.db import router` to the existing imports\n   - This provides the foundation for all other fixes to work\n\n2. **[Lines 59-70 - ensure_schema() method]**: Modify to respect router allow_migrate rules before table creation\n   - Add `app_label` parameter to method signature: `def ensure_schema(self, app_label=None):`\n   - Before creating the table, check: `if app_label and not router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label): return`\n   - This is the core fix that prevents unauthorized table creation on restricted databases\n\n3. **[Lines 84-87 - record_applied() method]**: Pass app_label context to ensure_schema()\n   - Modify call to: `self.ensure_schema(app)`\n   - This provides the necessary app context for router decision-making and coordinates with fix #2\n\n4. **[Lines 89-92 - record_unapplied() method]**: Pass app_label context to ensure_schema()\n   - Modify call to: `self.ensure_schema(app)`\n   - Maintains consistency with record_applied() and ensures both methods respect router rules\n\n5. **[Lines 72-82 - applied_migrations() method]**: Add router check for consistency\n   - Before returning migration data, verify router allows access to this database\n   - Add early return if router forbids migration operations on this connection\n   - This prevents reading migration data from databases where migrations shouldn't exist\n\nThese fixes work together as a coordinated solution: the import (#1) enables router functionality, the core logic (#2) implements the router check, the calling methods (#3, #4) provide necessary context, and the query method (#5) maintains consistency across all MigrationRecorder operations. This ensures the entire MigrationRecorder class respects the database router's allow_migrate rules.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 59-70\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def ensure_schema(self):\n        \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n        # If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema\n        # in the codebase.\n        if self.has_table():\n            return\n        # Make the table\n        try:\n            with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n                editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n        except DatabaseError as exc:\n            raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 84-87\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def record_applied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was applied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 89-92\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def record_unapplied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was unapplied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 1-6\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfrom django.apps.registry import Apps\nfrom django.db import DatabaseError, models\nfrom django.utils.functional import classproperty\nfrom django.utils.timezone import now\n\nfrom .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n\n\n[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 72-82\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def applied_migrations(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return a dict mapping (app_name, migration_name) to Migration instances\n        for all applied migrations.\n        \"\"\"\n        if self.has_table():\n            return {(migration.app, migration.name): migration for migration in self.migration_qs}\n        else:\n            # If the django_migrations table doesn't exist, then no migrations\n            # are applied.\n            return {}\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that:\n1.

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n### 5. Database Router Pattern Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: Multiple searches for \"allow_migrate\" patterns across Django codebase\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Database routers implement `allow_migrate(db, app_label, **hints)` method\n  - Returns `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n  - Standard pattern: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found routers in `/tests/migrations/test_multidb.py`:\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `None` (no opinion)\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `False` (don't migrate)\n    - `AlwaysMigrateRouter`: returns `True` (always migrate)\n    - `HintMigrateRouter`: returns based on hints\n\n### 6. Failing Test Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on test `test_migrate_record_replaced` (lines 903-924)\n- **Test Purpose**: Verifies that running a squashed migration records all original replaced migrations as run\n- **Test Flow**:\n  1.

Router Usage Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for router import and usage patterns\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Standard import: `from django.db import router`\n  - Typical usage: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found examples in migration operations showing proper router checking before database operations\n\n### 9. Detailed Router Call Pattern Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"router.allow_migrate(\" in migrations directory\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Standard pattern: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Used in `/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py` for RunSQL and RunPython operations\n  - Used in `/django/db/migrations/executor.py` for model operations\n  - Consistent pattern across all migration operations\n\n### 10. MigrationRecorder Method Call Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"record_applied(\" calls\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Called from `/django/db/migrations/executor.py` with `app_label` parameter\n  - Pattern: `self.recorder.record_applied(migration.app_label, migration.name)`\n  - Also called with replacement migrations: `self.recorder.record_applied(app_label, name)`\n  - The `app` parameter in `record_applied(app, name)` is actually the `app_label`\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### **Root Cause**: \nThe `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method **does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules** when creating the `django_migrations` table.\n\n### **Current Problematic Behavior**:\n1. `record_applied()` calls `ensure_schema()`\n2. `ensure_schema()` creates the `django_migrations` table without checking routers\n3.

This causes Django to create tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids it (returning `False` from `allow_migrate`).\n\n**Key Issue**: When `record_applied()` is called, it immediately calls `ensure_schema()` which creates the table regardless of router rules. The same pattern exists in `record_unapplied()`.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 59,\n            \"end_line\": 70\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 84,\n            \"end_line\": 87\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 89,\n            \"end_line\": 92\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1,\n            \"end_line\": 6\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 72,\n            \"end_line\": 82\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the interconnected bug locations, here are my coordinated repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Lines 1-6 - Import section]**: Add router import to enable database routing checks\n   - Add `from django.db import router` to the existing imports\n   - This provides the foundation for all other fixes to work\n\n2. **[Lines 59-70 - ensure_schema() method]**: Modify to respect router allow_migrate rules before table creation\n   - Add `app_label` parameter to method signature: `def ensure_schema(self, app_label=None):`\n   - Before creating the table, check: `if app_label and not router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label): return`\n   - This is the core fix that prevents unauthorized table creation on restricted databases\n\n3. **[Lines 84-87 - record_applied() method]**: Pass app_label context to ensure_schema()\n   - Modify call to: `self.ensure_schema(app)`\n   - This provides the necessary app context for router decision-making and coordinates with fix #2\n\n4. **[Lines 89-92 - record_unapplied() method]**: Pass app_label context to ensure_schema()\n   - Modify call to: `self.ensure_schema(app)`\n   - Maintains consistency with record_applied() and ensures both methods respect router rules\n\n5. **[Lines 72-82 - applied_migrations() method]**: Add router check for consistency\n   - Before returning migration data, verify router allows access to this database\n   - Add early return if router forbids migration operations on this connection\n   - This prevents reading migration data from databases where migrations shouldn't exist\n\nThese fixes work together as a coordinated solution: the import (#1) enables router functionality, the core logic (#2) implements the router check, the calling methods (#3, #4) provide necessary context, and the query method (#5) maintains consistency across all MigrationRecorder operations.

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\n\nLooking at the provided code segments and comparing them to my earlier suggestions, I can see all the key locations that need to be modified:\n\n1. **Location 4 (lines 1-6)**: Import section - needs `from django.db import router` added\n2. **Location 1 (lines 59-70)**: `ensure_schema()` method - needs to accept `app_label` parameter and check router before creating table\n3. **Location 2 (lines 84-87)**: `record_applied()` method - needs to pass `app` parameter to `ensure_schema()`\n4. **Location 3 (lines 89-92)**: `record_unapplied()` method - needs to pass `app` parameter to `ensure_schema()`\n5. **Location 5 (lines 72-82)**: `applied_migrations()` method - needs router check for consistency\n\nThe problem is clear: MigrationRecorder creates the `django_migrations` table on all database connections without respecting the router's `allow_migrate` rules. The router in the problem statement returns `False` for non-default databases, but MigrationRecorder ignores this and creates tables anyway.\n\nAll locations are present and the fixes are straightforward to implement based on my analysis.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, these locations are ready for fixing. I have all the necessary code segments to implement the coordinated fix:\n\n1. **Import addition**: Add router import to enable database routing functionality\n2. **Core logic fix**: Modify `ensure_schema()` to accept app_label and check router before table creation  \n3. **Method coordination**: Update `record_applied()` and `record_unapplied()` to pass app context\n4. **Consistency fix**: Add router check to `applied_migrations()` for complete compliance\n\nThe fix will ensure MigrationRecorder respects the database router's `allow_migrate` rules by preventing table creation on restricted database connections, which directly addresses the reported issue where tables were being created on non-default databases despite the router returning `False`.",

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Migration Bug Investigation and Fix Preparation Summary\n\n## Main Objective\nThe task is to find and repair a bug in a Django project related to the MigrationRecorder class and database routing functionality.\n\n## Key Investigation Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django`\n- **Result**: Confirmed this is a Django codebase with standard structure including `django/`, `tests/`, and configuration files\n\n### 2. MigrationRecorder Class Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - The `MigrationRecorder` class manages migration records in the database\n  - Contains methods: `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, `record_unapplied()`, `applied_migrations()`\n  - Uses a lazy-loaded `Migration` model with fields: `app`, `name`, `applied`\n  - The `record_applied()` method calls `ensure_schema()` before creating migration records\n\n### 3. Test Structure Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory` on `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations`\n- **Result**: Found extensive test suite with multiple test files including `test_commands.py`, `test_multidb.py`, etc.\n\n### 4. Bug Context Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"MigrationRecorder\" and \"allow_migrate\"\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Found test `test_migrate_record_replaced` in `test_commands.py` (lines 904-907)\n  - Discovered database routing functionality with `allow_migrate` methods\n  - Found multiple router classes: `NoMigrateRouter`, `AlwaysMigrateRouter`, `HintMigrateRouter`\n\n### 5. Database Router Pattern Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: Multiple searches for \"allow_migrate\" patterns across Django codebase\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Database routers implement `allow_migrate(db, app_label, **hints)` method\n  - Returns `True`, `False`, or `None` to control migration behavior\n  - Standard pattern: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found routers in `/tests/migrations/test_multidb.py`:\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `None` (no opinion)\n    - `NoMigrateRouter`: returns `False` (don't migrate)\n    - `AlwaysMigrateRouter`: returns `True` (always migrate)\n    - `HintMigrateRouter`: returns based on hints\n\n### 6. Failing Test Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on test `test_migrate_record_replaced` (lines 903-924)\n- **Test Purpose**: Verifies that running a squashed migration records all original replaced migrations as run\n- **Test Flow**:\n  1. Creates MigrationRecorder instance\n  2. Calls `migrate` command\n  3. Verifies applied migrations are recorded correctly\n  4. Checks that both original and squashed migrations are marked as applied\n\n### 7. MigrationRecorder Implementation Deep Dive\n- **Tool Used**: `read_file_lines` on `ensure_schema()` method (lines 59-70)\n- **Current Implementation**:\n  ```python\n  def ensure_schema(self):\n      \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n      if self.has_table():\n          return\n      # Make the table\n      try:\n          with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n              editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n      except DatabaseError as exc:\n          raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n  ```\n\n### 8. Router Usage Pattern Discovery\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for router import and usage patterns\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Standard import: `from django.db import router`\n  - Typical usage: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Found examples in migration operations showing proper router checking before database operations\n\n### 9. Detailed Router Call Pattern Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"router.allow_migrate(\" in migrations directory\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Standard pattern: `router.allow_migrate(schema_editor.connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n  - Used in `/django/db/migrations/operations/special.py` for RunSQL and RunPython operations\n  - Used in `/django/db/migrations/executor.py` for model operations\n  - Consistent pattern across all migration operations\n\n### 10. MigrationRecorder Method Call Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` for \"record_applied(\" calls\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Called from `/django/db/migrations/executor.py` with `app_label` parameter\n  - Pattern: `self.recorder.record_applied(migration.app_label, migration.name)`\n  - Also called with replacement migrations: `self.recorder.record_applied(app_label, name)`\n  - The `app` parameter in `record_applied(app, name)` is actually the `app_label`\n\n## Bug Identification\n\n### **Root Cause**: \nThe `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method **does not respect database router `allow_migrate` rules** when creating the `django_migrations` table.\n\n### **Current Problematic Behavior**:\n1. `record_applied()` calls `ensure_schema()`\n2. `ensure_schema()` creates the `django_migrations` table without checking routers\n3. This happens regardless of what `router.allow_migrate()` returns\n4. Even if a router says \"don't migrate on this database\", MigrationRecorder still creates its table\n5. Same issue exists in `record_unapplied()` method\n\n### **Expected Behavior**:\n1. Before creating the `django_migrations` table, check `router.allow_migrate()`\n2. If router returns `False`, skip table creation\n3. Respect router decisions for all MigrationRecorder operations\n\n## Technical Details Discovered\n\n### MigrationRecorder Key Methods:\n- `ensure_schema()`: Creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist (**BUG HERE**)\n- `record_applied(app, name)`: Records a migration as applied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `record_unapplied(app, name)`: Records a migration as unapplied, calls `ensure_schema()` first\n- `has_table()`: Checks if the django_migrations table exists\n- `applied_migrations()`: Returns applied migrations (may also need router checks)\n\n### Router Integration Pattern:\n- Import: `from django.db import router`\n- Check: `router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, app_label, **hints)`\n- For MigrationRecorder, app_label should be passed from the calling methods\n\n## Fix Strategy Development\n\n### **Coordinated Fix Approach**:\nBased on analysis of all affected locations, the fix requires coordinated changes across multiple methods:\n\n1. **Import Addition**: Add `from django.db import router` to imports\n2. **Core Logic Fix**: Modify `ensure_schema()` to accept `app_label` parameter and check router\n3. **Calling Method Updates**: Update `record_applied()` and `record_unapplied()` to pass app_label\n4. **Consistency Fix**: Update `applied_migrations()` for consistent router behavior\n\n### **Specific Locations Identified for Fix**:\n\n1. **[Lines 1-6]** - Import section: Add router import\n2. **[Lines 59-70]** - `ensure_schema()` method: Add router check before table creation\n3. **[Lines 84-87]** - `record_applied()` method: Pass app parameter to ensure_schema\n4. **[Lines 89-92]** - `record_unapplied()` method: Pass app parameter to ensure_schema  \n5. **[Lines 72-82]** - `applied_migrations()` method: Add router check for consistency\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### Completed:\n1. ✅ Located and examined the MigrationRecorder class implementation\n2. ✅ Identified the test structure and relevant test files\n3. ✅ Found references to the failing test `test_migrate_record_replaced`\n4. ✅ Discovered database routing functionality and usage patterns\n5. ✅ **Identified the specific bug**: `ensure_schema()` doesn't check `router.allow_migrate()`\n6. ✅ Analyzed router usage patterns across Django codebase\n7. ✅ Understood the expected behavior from test analysis\n8. ✅ **Analyzed all affected code locations in detail**\n9. ✅ **Developed comprehensive fix strategy**\n10. ✅ **Confirmed all 5 locations are ready for coordinated fixes**\n\n### **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**:\nAll code locations have been thoroughly analyzed and are ready for fixing:\n\n- **Location 1** [Lines 1-6]: Import section - needs `router` import added\n- **Location 2** [Lines 59-70]: `ensure_schema()` - needs router check and app_label parameter\n- **Location 3** [Lines 84-87]: `record_applied()` - needs to pass app to ensure_schema()\n- **Location 4** [Lines 89-92]: `record_unapplied()` - needs to pass app to ensure_schema()\n- **Location 5** [Lines 72-82]: `applied_migrations()` - needs router check for consistency\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThe investigation is complete and all locations are ready for implementation.

This ensures the entire MigrationRecorder class respects the database router's allow_migrate rules.\nNote that the Patch provided should be a direct substitution of the location code by the Locator.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the problem description and codebase investigation, I have identified the root cause and specific locations where the MigrationRecorder violates database router `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n**Root Cause**: The `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema()` method creates the `django_migrations` table without checking if the database router allows migrations on that database connection. This causes Django to create tables on databases where the router explicitly forbids it (returning `False` from `allow_migrate`).\n\n**Key Issue**: When `record_applied()` is called, it immediately calls `ensure_schema()` which creates the table regardless of router rules. The same pattern exists in `record_unapplied()`.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 59,\n            \"end_line\": 70\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 84,\n            \"end_line\": 87\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 89,\n            \"end_line\": 92\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1,\n            \"end_line\": 6\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 72,\n            \"end_line\": 82\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the interconnected bug locations, here are my coordinated repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Lines 1-6 - Import section]**: Add router import to enable database routing checks\n   - Add `from django.db import router` to the existing imports\n   - This provides the foundation for all other fixes to work\n\n2. **[Lines 59-70 - ensure_schema() method]**: Modify to respect router allow_migrate rules before table creation\n   - Add `app_label` parameter to method signature: `def ensure_schema(self, app_label=None):`\n   - Before creating the table, check: `if app_label and not router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label): return`\n   - This is the core fix that prevents unauthorized table creation on restricted databases\n\n3. **[Lines 84-87 - record_applied() method]**: Pass app_label context to ensure_schema()\n   - Modify call to: `self.ensure_schema(app)`\n   - This provides the necessary app context for router decision-making and coordinates with fix #2\n\n4. **[Lines 89-92 - record_unapplied() method]**: Pass app_label context to ensure_schema()\n   - Modify call to: `self.ensure_schema(app)`\n   - Maintains consistency with record_applied() and ensures both methods respect router rules\n\n5. **[Lines 72-82 - applied_migrations() method]**: Add router check for consistency\n   - Before returning migration data, verify router allows access to this database\n   - Add early return if router forbids migration operations on this connection\n   - This prevents reading migration data from databases where migrations shouldn't exist\n\nThese fixes work together as a coordinated solution: the import (#1) enables router functionality, the core logic (#2) implements the router check, the calling methods (#3, #4) provide necessary context, and the query method (#5) maintains consistency across all MigrationRecorder operations.

This ensures the entire MigrationRecorder class respects the database router's allow_migrate rules.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 59-70\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def ensure_schema(self):\n        \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n        # If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema\n        # in the codebase.\n        if self.has_table():\n            return\n        # Make the table\n        try:\n            with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n                editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n        except DatabaseError as exc:\n            raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc)\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 84-87\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def record_applied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was applied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 89-92\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def record_unapplied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was unapplied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 1-6\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfrom django.apps.registry import Apps\nfrom django.db import DatabaseError, models\nfrom django.utils.functional import classproperty\nfrom django.utils.timezone import now\n\nfrom .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing\n\n\n\nBug Locations\n:[Location 5] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations/recorder.py lines 72-82\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def applied_migrations(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return a dict mapping (app_name, migration_name) to Migration instances\n        for all applied migrations.\n        \"\"\"\n        if self.has_table():\n            return {(migration.app, migration.name): migration for migration in self.migration_qs}\n        else:\n            # If the django_migrations table doesn't exist, then no migrations\n            # are applied.\n            return {}\n\n\n\n**Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n",
