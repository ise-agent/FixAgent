Gets all constraint names for the given columns\n2. Excludes meta constraints and indexes \n3. Expects exactly 1 constraint to be found\n4. Fails with ValueError when it finds 2 (unique + index on same fields)\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Line 380: `self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'unique': True}, self.sql_delete_unique)` - called for unique_together deletion\n- Line 396: `self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)` - called for index_together deletion\n\nWhen both unique_together and index_together exist on the same fields, and we try to delete just the index_together, the method finds both constraints and crashes.\n\nLet me examine the `_constraint_names` method to understand how it filters constraints.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"def _constraint_names\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'def _constraint_names' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nLines 1139-1145:\n1139:             name=self.quote_name(name),\n1140:         )\n1141: \n1142:     def _constraint_names(self, model, column_names=None, unique=None,\n1143:                           primary_key=None, index=None, foreign_key=None,\n1144:                           check=None, type_=None, exclude=None):\n1145:         \"\"\"Return all constraint names matching the columns and conditions.\"\"\"\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nNow let me see the complete `_constraint_names` method to understand how it works:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 1142, \"end_line\": 1170 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 1142-1170:\n\n1142:     def _constraint_names(self, model, column_names=None, unique=None,\n1143:                           primary_key=None, index=None, foreign_key=None,\n1144:                           check=None, type_=None, exclude=None):\n1145:         \"\"\"Return all constraint names matching the columns and conditions.\"\"\"\n1146:         if column_names is not None:\n1147:             column_names = [\n1148:                 self.connection.introspection.identifier_converter(name)\n1149:                 for name in column_names\n1150:             ]\n1151:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n1152:             constraints = self.connection.introspection.get_constraints(cursor, model._meta.db_table)\n1153:         result = []\n1154:         for name, infodict in constraints.items():\n1155:             if column_names is None or column_names == infodict['columns']:\n1156:                 if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:\n1157:                     continue\n1158:                 if primary_key is not None and infodict['primary_key'] != primary_key:\n1159:                     continue\n1160:                 if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n1161:                     continue\n1162:                 if check is not None and infodict['check'] != check:\n1163:                     continue\n1164:                 if foreign_key is not None and not infodict['foreign_key']:\n1165:                     continue\n1166:                 if type_ is not None and infodict['type'] != type_:\n1167:                     continue\n1168:                 if not exclude or name not in exclude:\n1169:                     result.append(name)\n1170:         return result\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1.

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n",

Gets all constraint names for the given columns\n2. Excludes meta constraints and indexes \n3. Expects exactly 1 constraint to be found\n4. Fails with ValueError when it finds 2 (unique + index on same fields)\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Line 380: `self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'unique': True}, self.sql_delete_unique)` - called for unique_together deletion\n- Line 396: `self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)` - called for index_together deletion\n\nWhen both unique_together and index_together exist on the same fields, and we try to delete just the index_together, the method finds both constraints and crashes.\n\nLet me examine the `_constraint_names` method to understand how it filters constraints.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"def _constraint_names\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'def _constraint_names' in file (showing first 1 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nLines 1139-1145:\n1139:             name=self.quote_name(name),\n1140:         )\n1141: \n1142:     def _constraint_names(self, model, column_names=None, unique=None,\n1143:                           primary_key=None, index=None, foreign_key=None,\n1144:                           check=None, type_=None, exclude=None):\n1145:         \"\"\"Return all constraint names matching the columns and conditions.\"\"\"\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\nAssistant: Now let me see the complete `_constraint_names` method to understand how it works:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 1142, \"end_line\": 1170 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 1142-1170:\n\n1142:     def _constraint_names(self, model, column_names=None, unique=None,\n1143:                           primary_key=None, index=None, foreign_key=None,\n1144:                           check=None, type_=None, exclude=None):\n1145:         \"\"\"Return all constraint names matching the columns and conditions.\"\"\"\n1146:         if column_names is not None:\n1147:             column_names = [\n1148:                 self.connection.introspection.identifier_converter(name)\n1149:                 for name in column_names\n1150:             ]\n1151:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n1152:             constraints = self.connection.introspection.get_constraints(cursor, model._meta.db_table)\n1153:         result = []\n1154:         for name, infodict in constraints.items():\n1155:             if column_names is None or column_names == infodict['columns']:\n1156:                 if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:\n1157:                     continue\n1158:                 if primary_key is not None and infodict['primary_key'] != primary_key:\n1159:                     continue\n1160:                 if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n1161:                     continue\n1162:                 if check is not None and infodict['check'] != check:\n1163:                     continue\n1164:                 if foreign_key is not None and not infodict['foreign_key']:\n1165:                     continue\n1166:                 if type_ is not None and infodict['type'] != type_:\n1167:                     continue\n1168:                 if not exclude or name not in exclude:\n1169:                     result.append(name)\n1170:         return result\n\n\nAssistant: Now I have a complete understanding of the bug.

[输出被截断，原始长度: 6490 字符，显示前 5000 字符]\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1. What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields\nDescription\n\t\nHappens with Django 1.11.10\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together\n2) Delete index_together -> Fail\nIt will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nBased on the complete understanding of the bug, let me summarize what I know:\n\n**Bug Location and Root Cause:**\n- The bug is in `_delete_composed_index()` method at lines 402-416 in `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n- When both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields, deleting just the `index_together` fails\n- The method calls `_constraint_names()` which returns both constraints (unique and index), but the method expects exactly 1 constraint\n- This causes a `ValueError: \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\"`\n\n**The Technical Flow:**\n1. `alter_index_together()` (line 396) calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n2. `_delete_composed_index()` calls `_constraint_names()` to find matching constraints\n3. `_constraint_names()` filters constraints but the filtering isn't specific enough when both unique and index constraints exist on same columns\n4. The method fails at line 410 because `len(constraint_names) != 1`\n\n**The Fix Strategy:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method has parameters for filtering by constraint type (`unique`, `index`, etc.) but the `_delete_composed_index()` method isn't using them properly. Looking at line 160 in `_constraint_names()`, it does check `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index`, so the filtering mechanism exists.\n\nThe issue is that `_delete_composed_index()` passes `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}` but needs to also specify that it doesn't want unique constraints when deleting index constraints.\n\nNow I need to identify the specific locations that need fixing to provide the precise line ranges for repair.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 402, \"end_line\": 416 }",

[输出被截断，原始长度: 6490 字符，显示前 5000 字符]\n#REFLECT\nBased on the complete understanding of the bug, let me summarize what I know:\n\n**Bug Location and Root Cause:**\n- The bug is in `_delete_composed_index()` method at lines 402-416 in `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n- When both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields, deleting just the `index_together` fails\n- The method calls `_constraint_names()` which returns both constraints (unique and index), but the method expects exactly 1 constraint\n- This causes a `ValueError: \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\"`\n\n**The Technical Flow:**\n1. `alter_index_together()` (line 396) calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n2. `_delete_composed_index()` calls `_constraint_names()` to find matching constraints\n3. `_constraint_names()` filters constraints but the filtering isn't specific enough when both unique and index constraints exist on same columns\n4. The method fails at line 410 because `len(constraint_names) != 1`\n\n**The Fix Strategy:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method has parameters for filtering by constraint type (`unique`, `index`, etc.) but the `_delete_composed_index()` method isn't using them properly. Looking at line 160 in `_constraint_names()`, it does check `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index`, so the filtering mechanism exists.\n\nThe issue is that `_delete_composed_index()` passes `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}` but needs to also specify that it doesn't want unique constraints when deleting index constraints.\n\nNow I need to identify the specific locations that need fixing to provide the precise line ranges for repair.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 402, \"end_line\": 416 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 402-416:\n\n 402:     def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):\n 403:         meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}\n 404:         meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}\n 405:         columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]\n 406:         constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n 407:             model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n 408:             **constraint_kwargs\n 409:         )\n 410:         if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n 411:             raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n 412:                 len(constraint_names),\n 413:                 model._meta.db_table,\n 414:                 \", \".join(columns),\n 415:             ))\n 416:         self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1. What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields\nDescription\n\t\nHappens with Django 1.11.10\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together\n2) Delete index_together -> Fail\nIt will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n",

[输出被截断，原始长度: 6490 字符，显示前 5000 字符]\n#REFLECT\nBased on the complete understanding of the bug, let me summarize what I know:\n\n**Bug Location and Root Cause:**\n- The bug is in `_delete_composed_index()` method at lines 402-416 in `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n- When both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields, deleting just the `index_together` fails\n- The method calls `_constraint_names()` which returns both constraints (unique and index), but the method expects exactly 1 constraint\n- This causes a `ValueError: \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\"`\n\n**The Technical Flow:**\n1. `alter_index_together()` (line 396) calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n2. `_delete_composed_index()` calls `_constraint_names()` to find matching constraints\n3. `_constraint_names()` filters constraints but the filtering isn't specific enough when both unique and index constraints exist on same columns\n4. The method fails at line 410 because `len(constraint_names) != 1`\n\n**The Fix Strategy:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method has parameters for filtering by constraint type (`unique`, `index`, etc.) but the `_delete_composed_index()` method isn't using them properly. Looking at line 160 in `_constraint_names()`, it does check `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index`, so the filtering mechanism exists.\n\nThe issue is that `_delete_composed_index()` passes `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}` but needs to also specify that it doesn't want unique constraints when deleting index constraints.\n\nNow I need to identify the specific locations that need fixing to provide the precise line ranges for repair.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 402, \"end_line\": 416 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 402-416:\n\n 402:     def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):\n 403:         meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}\n 404:         meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}\n 405:         columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]\n 406:         constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n 407:             model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n 408:             **constraint_kwargs\n 409:         )\n 410:         if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n 411:             raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n 412:                 len(constraint_names),\n 413:                 model._meta.db_table,\n 414:                 \", \".join(columns),\n 415:             ))\n 416:         self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))\n\nNow let me look at the specific calls to `_delete_composed_index()` to understand how the constraint_kwargs are passed:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 390, \"end_line\": 400 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 390-400:\n\n 390:         [\"foo\", \"bar\"] format.\n 391:         \"\"\"\n 392:         olds = {tuple(fields) for fields in old_index_together}\n 393:         news = {tuple(fields) for fields in new_index_together}\n 394:         # Deleted indexes\n 395:         for fields in olds.difference(news):\n 396:             self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n 397:         # Created indexes\n 398:         for field_names in news.difference(olds):\n 399:             fields = [model._meta.get_field(field) for field in field_names]\n 400:             self.execute(self._create_index_sql(model, fields, suffix=\"_idx\"))\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1. What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields\nDescription\n\t\nHappens with Django 1.11.10\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together\n2) Delete index_together -> Fail\nIt will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n",

[输出被截断，原始长度: 6490 字符，显示前 5000 字符]\n#REFLECT\nBased on the complete understanding of the bug, let me summarize what I know:\n\n**Bug Location and Root Cause:**\n- The bug is in `_delete_composed_index()` method at lines 402-416 in `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n- When both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields, deleting just the `index_together` fails\n- The method calls `_constraint_names()` which returns both constraints (unique and index), but the method expects exactly 1 constraint\n- This causes a `ValueError: \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\"`\n\n**The Technical Flow:**\n1. `alter_index_together()` (line 396) calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n2. `_delete_composed_index()` calls `_constraint_names()` to find matching constraints\n3. `_constraint_names()` filters constraints but the filtering isn't specific enough when both unique and index constraints exist on same columns\n4. The method fails at line 410 because `len(constraint_names) != 1`\n\n**The Fix Strategy:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method has parameters for filtering by constraint type (`unique`, `index`, etc.) but the `_delete_composed_index()` method isn't using them properly. Looking at line 160 in `_constraint_names()`, it does check `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index`, so the filtering mechanism exists.\n\nThe issue is that `_delete_composed_index()` passes `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}` but needs to also specify that it doesn't want unique constraints when deleting index constraints.\n\nNow I need to identify the specific locations that need fixing to provide the precise line ranges for repair.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 402, \"end_line\": 416 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 402-416:\n\n 402:     def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):\n 403:         meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}\n 404:         meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}\n 405:         columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]\n 406:         constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n 407:             model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n 408:             **constraint_kwargs\n 409:         )\n 410:         if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n 411:             raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n 412:                 len(constraint_names),\n 413:                 model._meta.db_table,\n 414:                 \", \".join(columns),\n 415:             ))\n 416:         self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))\n\nNow let me look at the specific calls to `_delete_composed_index()` to understand how the constraint_kwargs are passed:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 390, \"end_line\": 400 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 390-400:\n\n 390:         [\"foo\", \"bar\"] format.\n 391:         \"\"\"\n 392:         olds = {tuple(fields) for fields in old_index_together}\n 393:         news = {tuple(fields) for fields in new_index_together}\n 394:         # Deleted indexes\n 395:         for fields in olds.difference(news):\n 396:             self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n 397:         # Created indexes\n 398:         for field_names in news.difference(olds):\n 399:             fields = [model._meta.get_field(field) for field in field_names]\n 400:             self.execute(self._create_index_sql(model, fields, suffix=\"_idx\"))\n\nNow let me check the `alter_unique_together` method to see how it handles the same situation:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 370, \"end_line\": 390 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 370-390:\n\n 370:     def alter_unique_together(self, model, old_unique_together, new_unique_together):\n 371:         \"\"\"\n 372:         Deal with a model changing its unique_together.

What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields\nDescription\n\t\nHappens with Django 1.11.10\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together\n2) Delete index_together -> Fail\nIt will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n",
    "response": "Perfect! Now I have all the information needed to identify the precise bug locations. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the `_delete_composed_index()` method. When both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields:\n\n1. **Line 396**: `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'index': True}`\n2. **Line 380**: `alter_unique_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'unique': True}`\n3. **Lines 406-408**: `_delete_composed_index()` calls `_constraint_names()` with the constraint_kwargs\n4. **Line 410**: The method fails because it finds 2 constraints instead of 1\n\n**The Problem:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method at lines 1154-1170 filters constraints, but when both unique and index constraints exist on the same columns, passing `{'index': True}` doesn't exclude unique constraints that also happen to be indexes.\n\nLooking at the `_constraint_names()` filtering logic:\n- Line 1160: `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:` - this checks if the constraint is an index\n- Line 1156: `if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:` - this checks if the constraint is unique\n\nThe issue is that a unique constraint can also be an index (unique constraints are typically implemented as unique indexes in databases), so when we pass `{'index': True}`, both the unique constraint and the regular index constraint match.\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `_delete_composed_index()` method needs to be more specific about which type of constraint to delete. When deleting an index_together, it should exclude unique constraints, and when deleting unique_together, it should exclude regular index constraints.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified:\n\n1. **Lines 406-408**: The `_constraint_names()` call in `_delete_composed_index()` needs to be more specific about filtering constraint types to avoid conflicts between unique and index constraints on the same fields.\n\n2. **Line 410**: The validation logic that expects exactly 1 constraint needs to be updated to handle the case where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields.\n\n3. **Line 396**: The call from `alter_index_together()` needs to pass additional parameters to exclude unique constraints when deleting index constraints.\n\n4. **Line 380**: The call from `alter_unique_together()` needs to pass additional parameters to exclude index constraints when deleting unique constraints.\n\n5. **Lines 1156-1160**: The filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` method needs to be enhanced to properly distinguish between different constraint types when both exist on the same columns.",

[输出被截断，原始长度: 6490 字符，显示前 5000 字符]\n#REFLECT\nBased on the complete understanding of the bug, let me summarize what I know:\n\n**Bug Location and Root Cause:**\n- The bug is in `_delete_composed_index()` method at lines 402-416 in `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n- When both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields, deleting just the `index_together` fails\n- The method calls `_constraint_names()` which returns both constraints (unique and index), but the method expects exactly 1 constraint\n- This causes a `ValueError: \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\"`\n\n**The Technical Flow:**\n1. `alter_index_together()` (line 396) calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n2. `_delete_composed_index()` calls `_constraint_names()` to find matching constraints\n3. `_constraint_names()` filters constraints but the filtering isn't specific enough when both unique and index constraints exist on same columns\n4. The method fails at line 410 because `len(constraint_names) != 1`\n\n**The Fix Strategy:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method has parameters for filtering by constraint type (`unique`, `index`, etc.) but the `_delete_composed_index()` method isn't using them properly. Looking at line 160 in `_constraint_names()`, it does check `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index`, so the filtering mechanism exists.\n\nThe issue is that `_delete_composed_index()` passes `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}` but needs to also specify that it doesn't want unique constraints when deleting index constraints.\n\nNow I need to identify the specific locations that need fixing to provide the precise line ranges for repair.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 402, \"end_line\": 416 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 402-416:\n\n 402:     def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):\n 403:         meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}\n 404:         meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}\n 405:         columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]\n 406:         constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n 407:             model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n 408:             **constraint_kwargs\n 409:         )\n 410:         if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n 411:             raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n 412:                 len(constraint_names),\n 413:                 model._meta.db_table,\n 414:                 \", \".join(columns),\n 415:             ))\n 416:         self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))\n\nNow let me look at the specific calls to `_delete_composed_index()` to understand how the constraint_kwargs are passed:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 390, \"end_line\": 400 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 390-400:\n\n 390:         [\"foo\", \"bar\"] format.\n 391:         \"\"\"\n 392:         olds = {tuple(fields) for fields in old_index_together}\n 393:         news = {tuple(fields) for fields in new_index_together}\n 394:         # Deleted indexes\n 395:         for fields in olds.difference(news):\n 396:             self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n 397:         # Created indexes\n 398:         for field_names in news.difference(olds):\n 399:             fields = [model._meta.get_field(field) for field in field_names]\n 400:             self.execute(self._create_index_sql(model, fields, suffix=\"_idx\"))\n\nNow let me check the `alter_unique_together` method to see how it handles the same situation:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 370, \"end_line\": 390 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 370-390:\n\n 370:     def alter_unique_together(self, model, old_unique_together, new_unique_together):\n 371:         \"\"\"\n 372:         Deal with a model changing its unique_together.

Now I have all the information needed to identify the precise bug locations. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the `_delete_composed_index()` method. When both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields:\n\n1. **Line 396**: `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'index': True}`\n2. **Line 380**: `alter_unique_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'unique': True}`\n3. **Lines 406-408**: `_delete_composed_index()` calls `_constraint_names()` with the constraint_kwargs\n4. **Line 410**: The method fails because it finds 2 constraints instead of 1\n\n**The Problem:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method at lines 1154-1170 filters constraints, but when both unique and index constraints exist on the same columns, passing `{'index': True}` doesn't exclude unique constraints that also happen to be indexes.\n\nLooking at the `_constraint_names()` filtering logic:\n- Line 1160: `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:` - this checks if the constraint is an index\n- Line 1156: `if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:` - this checks if the constraint is unique\n\nThe issue is that a unique constraint can also be an index (unique constraints are typically implemented as unique indexes in databases), so when we pass `{'index': True}`, both the unique constraint and the regular index constraint match.\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `_delete_composed_index()` method needs to be more specific about which type of constraint to delete. When deleting an index_together, it should exclude unique constraints, and when deleting unique_together, it should exclude regular index constraints.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified:\n\n1. **Lines 406-408**: The `_constraint_names()` call in `_delete_composed_index()` needs to be more specific about filtering constraint types to avoid conflicts between unique and index constraints on the same fields.\n\n2. **Line 410**: The validation logic that expects exactly 1 constraint needs to be updated to handle the case where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields.\n\n3. **Line 396**: The call from `alter_index_together()` needs to pass additional parameters to exclude unique constraints when deleting index constraints.\n\n4. **Line 380**: The call from `alter_unique_together()` needs to pass additional parameters to exclude index constraints when deleting unique constraints.\n\n5. **Lines 1156-1160**: The filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` method needs to be enhanced to properly distinguish between different constraint types when both exist on the same columns.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields\nDescription\n\t\nHappens with Django 1.11.10\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together\n2) Delete index_together -> Fail\nIt will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list.

`alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` at line 396\n   - `_delete_composed_index()` uses `_constraint_names()` to find matching constraints\n   - `_constraint_names()` queries the database introspection to get all constraints matching the columns\n   - When both unique and index constraints exist on same fields, it returns both constraint names\n   - The method fails because `len(constraint_names) != 1` (line 410)\n\n2. **Key Code Locations:**\n   - Bug location: Lines 402-416 in `schema.py`\n   - Called from: Line 396 (`alter_index_together`) and Line 380 (`alter_unique_together`)\n   - Constraint discovery: `_constraint_names()` method at lines 1142-1170\n\n3. **Current Logic Flaw:**\n   -

The method fails at line 410 because `len(constraint_names) != 1`\n\n**The Fix Strategy:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method has parameters for filtering by constraint type (`unique`, `index`, etc.) but the `_delete_composed_index()` method isn't using them properly. Looking at line 160 in `_constraint_names()`, it does check `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index`, so the filtering mechanism exists.\n\nThe issue is that `_delete_composed_index()` passes `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}` but needs to also specify that it doesn't want unique constraints when deleting index constraints.\n\nNow I need to identify the specific locations that need fixing to provide the precise line ranges for repair.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 402, \"end_line\": 416 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 402-416:\n\n 402:     def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):\n 403:         meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}\n 404:         meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}\n 405:         columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]\n 406:         constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n 407:             model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n 408:             **constraint_kwargs\n 409:         )\n 410:         if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n 411:             raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n 412:                 len(constraint_names),\n 413:                 model._meta.db_table,\n 414:                 \", \".join(columns),\n 415:             ))\n 416:         self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))\n\nNow let me look at the specific calls to `_delete_composed_index()` to understand how the constraint_kwargs are passed:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 390, \"end_line\": 400 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 390-400:\n\n 390:         [\"foo\", \"bar\"] format.\n 391:         \"\"\"\n 392:         olds = {tuple(fields) for fields in old_index_together}\n 393:         news = {tuple(fields) for fields in new_index_together}\n 394:         # Deleted indexes\n 395:         for fields in olds.difference(news):\n 396:             self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n 397:         # Created indexes\n 398:         for field_names in news.difference(olds):\n 399:             fields = [model._meta.get_field(field) for field in field_names]\n 400:             self.execute(self._create_index_sql(model, fields, suffix=\"_idx\"))\n\nNow let me check the `alter_unique_together` method to see how it handles the same situation:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 370, \"end_line\": 390 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 370-390:\n\n 370:     def alter_unique_together(self, model, old_unique_together, new_unique_together):\n 371:         \"\"\"\n 372:         Deal with a model changing its unique_together.

Now I have all the information needed to identify the precise bug locations. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the `_delete_composed_index()` method. When both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields:\n\n1. **Line 396**: `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'index': True}`\n2. **Line 380**: `alter_unique_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'unique': True}`\n3. **Lines 406-408**: `_delete_composed_index()` calls `_constraint_names()` with the constraint_kwargs\n4. **Line 410**: The method fails because it finds 2 constraints instead of 1\n\n**The Problem:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method at lines 1154-1170 filters constraints, but when both unique and index constraints exist on the same columns, passing `{'index': True}` doesn't exclude unique constraints that also happen to be indexes.\n\nLooking at the `_constraint_names()` filtering logic:\n- Line 1160: `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:` - this checks if the constraint is an index\n- Line 1156: `if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:` - this checks if the constraint is unique\n\nThe issue is that a unique constraint can also be an index (unique constraints are typically implemented as unique indexes in databases), so when we pass `{'index': True}`, both the unique constraint and the regular index constraint match.\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `_delete_composed_index()` method needs to be more specific about which type of constraint to delete. When deleting an index_together, it should exclude unique constraints, and when deleting unique_together, it should exclude regular index constraints.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified:\n\n1. **Lines 406-408**: The `_constraint_names()` call in `_delete_composed_index()` needs to be more specific about filtering constraint types to avoid conflicts between unique and index constraints on the same fields.\n\n2. **Line 410**: The validation logic that expects exactly 1 constraint needs to be updated to handle the case where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields.\n\n3. **Line 396**: The call from `alter_index_together()` needs to pass additional parameters to exclude unique constraints when deleting index constraints.\n\n4. **Line 380**: The call from `alter_unique_together()` needs to pass additional parameters to exclude index constraints when deleting unique constraints.\n\n5. **Lines 1156-1160**: The filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` method needs to be enhanced to properly distinguish between different constraint types when both exist on the same columns.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n#REFLECT\nBased on my complete analysis of the Django migration bug, I have identified the exact root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed.

The main bug location in `_delete_composed_index()` method where the constraint filtering and validation occurs\n2.

    "response": "PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django migration bug where deleting an `index_together` constraint fails when it shares the same fields as a `unique_together` constraint, here are my coordinated repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Lines 402-416] `_delete_composed_index()` method**: Modify the constraint filtering logic to be more specific about constraint types. Instead of just passing `constraint_kwargs`, add explicit filtering to exclude conflicting constraint types. When deleting an index constraint, exclude unique constraints, and vice versa. This requires updating the `_constraint_names()` call to pass additional parameters like `unique=False` when `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`.\n\n2. **[Lines 394-396] `alter_index_together()` call**: Update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass more specific constraint filtering parameters. Change from `{'index': True}` to `{'index': True, 'unique': False}` to explicitly exclude unique constraints when deleting index_together constraints. This works in coordination with suggestion 1 to ensure only the intended constraint type is found.\n\n3. **[Lines 378-380] `alter_unique_together()` call**: Similarly, update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass `{'unique': True, 'index': False}` instead of just `{'unique': True}` to explicitly exclude regular index constraints when deleting unique_together constraints.

Instead of just passing `constraint_kwargs`, add explicit filtering to exclude conflicting constraint types. When deleting an index constraint, exclude unique constraints, and vice versa. This requires updating the `_constraint_names()` call to pass additional parameters like `unique=False` when `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`.\n\n2. **[Lines 394-396] `alter_index_together()` call**: Update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass more specific constraint filtering parameters. Change from `{'index': True}` to `{'index': True, 'unique': False}` to explicitly exclude unique constraints when deleting index_together constraints. This works in coordination with suggestion 1 to ensure only the intended constraint type is found.\n\n3. **[Lines 378-380] `alter_unique_together()` call**: Similarly, update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass `{'unique': True, 'index': False}` instead of just `{'unique': True}` to explicitly exclude regular index constraints when deleting unique_together constraints. This mirrors the fix in suggestion 2 and ensures symmetrical behavior.\n\n4. **[Lines 1154-1170] `_constraint_names()` filtering logic**: Enhance the constraint filtering to properly handle the case where both `unique` and `index` parameters are specified. The current logic at lines 1156 and 1160 handles them independently, but when both are specified (as suggested in fixes 1-3), ensure the filtering works correctly to exclude constraints that don't match both criteria.\n\nThese suggestions work together to solve the core issue: the `_delete_composed_index()` method currently finds multiple constraints because it doesn't properly distinguish between unique and index constraint types when they exist on the same fields. By making the constraint filtering more explicit and specific, we ensure that only the intended constraint type is found and deleted, resolving the \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\" error.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me see the complete `_constraint_names` method to understand how it works:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 1142, \"end_line\": 1170 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 1142-1170:\n\n1142:     def _constraint_names(self, model, column_names=None, unique=None,\n1143:                           primary_key=None, index=None, foreign_key=None,\n1144:                           check=None, type_=None, exclude=None):\n1145:         \"\"\"Return all constraint names matching the columns and conditions.\"\"\"\n1146:         if column_names is not None:\n1147:             column_names = [\n1148:                 self.connection.introspection.identifier_converter(name)\n1149:                 for name in column_names\n1150:             ]\n1151:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n1152:             constraints = self.connection.introspection.get_constraints(cursor, model._meta.db_table)\n1153:         result = []\n1154:         for name, infodict in constraints.items():\n1155:             if column_names is None or column_names == infodict['columns']:\n1156:                 if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:\n1157:                     continue\n1158:                 if primary_key is not None and infodict['primary_key'] != primary_key:\n1159:                     continue\n1160:                 if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n1161:                     continue\n1162:                 if check is not None and infodict['check'] != check:\n1163:                     continue\n1164:                 if foreign_key is not None and not infodict['foreign_key']:\n1165:                     continue\n1166:                 if type_ is not None and infodict['type'] != type_:\n1167:                     continue\n1168:                 if not exclude or name not in exclude:\n1169:                     result.append(name)\n1170:         return result\n\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug.

[输出被截断，原始长度: 6490 字符，显示前 5000 字符]\n#REFLECT\nBased on the complete understanding of the bug, let me summarize what I know:\n\n**Bug Location and Root Cause:**\n- The bug is in `_delete_composed_index()` method at lines 402-416 in `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n- When both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields, deleting just the `index_together` fails\n- The method calls `_constraint_names()` which returns both constraints (unique and index), but the method expects exactly 1 constraint\n- This causes a `ValueError: \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\"`\n\n**The Technical Flow:**\n1. `alter_index_together()` (line 396) calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`\n2. `_delete_composed_index()` calls `_constraint_names()` to find matching constraints\n3. `_constraint_names()` filters constraints but the filtering isn't specific enough when both unique and index constraints exist on same columns\n4. The method fails at line 410 because `len(constraint_names) != 1`\n\n**The Fix Strategy:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method has parameters for filtering by constraint type (`unique`, `index`, etc.) but the `_delete_composed_index()` method isn't using them properly. Looking at line 160 in `_constraint_names()`, it does check `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index`, so the filtering mechanism exists.\n\nThe issue is that `_delete_composed_index()` passes `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}` but needs to also specify that it doesn't want unique constraints when deleting index constraints.\n\nNow I need to identify the specific locations that need fixing to provide the precise line ranges for repair.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 402, \"end_line\": 416 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 402-416:\n\n 402:     def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):\n 403:         meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}\n 404:         meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}\n 405:         columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]\n 406:         constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n 407:             model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n 408:             **constraint_kwargs\n 409:         )\n 410:         if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n 411:             raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n 412:                 len(constraint_names),\n 413:                 model._meta.db_table,\n 414:                 \", \".join(columns),\n 415:             ))\n 416:         self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))\n\nNow let me look at the specific calls to `_delete_composed_index()` to understand how the constraint_kwargs are passed:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 390, \"end_line\": 400 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 390-400:\n\n 390:         [\"foo\", \"bar\"] format.\n 391:         \"\"\"\n 392:         olds = {tuple(fields) for fields in old_index_together}\n 393:         news = {tuple(fields) for fields in new_index_together}\n 394:         # Deleted indexes\n 395:         for fields in olds.difference(news):\n 396:             self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n 397:         # Created indexes\n 398:         for field_names in news.difference(olds):\n 399:             fields = [model._meta.get_field(field) for field in field_names]\n 400:             self.execute(self._create_index_sql(model, fields, suffix=\"_idx\"))\n\nNow let me check the `alter_unique_together` method to see how it handles the same situation:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 370, \"end_line\": 390 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 370-390:\n\n 370:     def alter_unique_together(self, model, old_unique_together, new_unique_together):\n 371:         \"\"\"\n 372:         Deal with a model changing its unique_together.

Now I have all the information needed to identify the precise bug locations. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the `_delete_composed_index()` method. When both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields:\n\n1. **Line 396**: `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'index': True}`\n2. **Line 380**: `alter_unique_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'unique': True}`\n3. **Lines 406-408**: `_delete_composed_index()` calls `_constraint_names()` with the constraint_kwargs\n4. **Line 410**: The method fails because it finds 2 constraints instead of 1\n\n**The Problem:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method at lines 1154-1170 filters constraints, but when both unique and index constraints exist on the same columns, passing `{'index': True}` doesn't exclude unique constraints that also happen to be indexes.\n\nLooking at the `_constraint_names()` filtering logic:\n- Line 1160: `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:` - this checks if the constraint is an index\n- Line 1156: `if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:` - this checks if the constraint is unique\n\nThe issue is that a unique constraint can also be an index (unique constraints are typically implemented as unique indexes in databases), so when we pass `{'index': True}`, both the unique constraint and the regular index constraint match.\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `_delete_composed_index()` method needs to be more specific about which type of constraint to delete.

The bug occurs when deleting an `index_together` constraint that shares the same fields as a `unique_together` constraint. The `_delete_composed_index()` method finds both constraints and fails because it expects exactly one.\n\nThe key locations that need fixing are:\n\n1. The main bug location in `_delete_composed_index()` method where the constraint filtering and validation occurs\n2. The calls from `alter_index_together()` and `alter_unique_together()` that don't properly distinguish constraint types\n3. The constraint filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` method\n\nLet me provide the precise locations for repair.\n\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 402,\n            \"end_line\": 416\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 394,\n            \"end_line\": 396\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 378,\n            \"end_line\": 380\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1154,\n            \"end_line\": 1170\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django migration bug where deleting an `index_together` constraint fails when it shares the same fields as a `unique_together` constraint, here are my coordinated repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Lines 402-416] `_delete_composed_index()` method**: Modify the constraint filtering logic to be more specific about constraint types. Instead of just passing `constraint_kwargs`, add explicit filtering to exclude conflicting constraint types. When deleting an index constraint, exclude unique constraints, and vice versa. This requires updating the `_constraint_names()` call to pass additional parameters like `unique=False` when `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`.\n\n2. **[Lines 394-396] `alter_index_together()` call**: Update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass more specific constraint filtering parameters. Change from `{'index': True}` to `{'index': True, 'unique': False}` to explicitly exclude unique constraints when deleting index_together constraints. This works in coordination with suggestion 1 to ensure only the intended constraint type is found.\n\n3. **[Lines 378-380] `alter_unique_together()` call**: Similarly, update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass `{'unique': True, 'index': False}` instead of just `{'unique': True}` to explicitly exclude regular index constraints when deleting unique_together constraints. This mirrors the fix in suggestion 2 and ensures symmetrical behavior.\n\n4. **[Lines 1154-1170] `_constraint_names()` filtering logic**: Enhance the constraint filtering to properly handle the case where both `unique` and `index` parameters are specified. The current logic at lines 1156 and 1160 handles them independently, but when both are specified (as suggested in fixes 1-3), ensure the filtering works correctly to exclude constraints that don't match both criteria.\n\nThese suggestions work together to solve the core issue: the `_delete_composed_index()` method currently finds multiple constraints because it doesn't properly distinguish between unique and index constraint types when they exist on the same fields. By making the constraint filtering more explicit and specific, we ensure that only the intended constraint type is found and deleted, resolving the \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\" error.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 402-416\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):\n        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}\n        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}\n        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]\n        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n            **constraint_kwargs\n        )\n        if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n            raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n                len(constraint_names),\n                model._meta.db_table,\n                \", \".join(columns),\n            ))\n        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 394-396\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        # Deleted indexes\n        for fields in olds.difference(news):\n            self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 378-380\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        # Deleted uniques\n        for fields in olds.difference(news):\n            self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'unique': True}, self.sql_delete_unique)\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 1154-1170\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        for name, infodict in constraints.items():\n            if column_names is None or column_names == infodict['columns']:\n                if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:\n                    continue\n                if primary_key is not None and infodict['primary_key'] != primary_key:\n                    continue\n                if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n                    continue\n                if check is not None and infodict['check'] != check:\n                    continue\n                if foreign_key is not None and not infodict['foreign_key']:\n                    continue\n                if type_ is not None and infodict['type'] != type_:\n                    continue\n                if not exclude or name not in exclude:\n                    result.append(name)\n        return result\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nMigration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields\nDescription\n\t\nHappens with Django 1.11.10\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together\n2) Delete index_together -> Fail\nIt will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one.

    "response": "Looking at the provided code segments and my earlier suggestions, I can see that these locations are exactly where the bug manifests and where fixes need to be implemented.\n\n**Analysis of the locations:**\n\n1. **Location 1 (lines 402-416)**: This is the core method `_delete_composed_index()` where the bug occurs. The method calls `_constraint_names()` with `constraint_kwargs` but doesn't properly filter out conflicting constraint types. This is where the \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\" error is raised.\n\n2. **Location 2 (lines 394-396)**: This is where `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with only `{'index': True}`, which doesn't exclude unique constraints that may exist on the same fields.\n\n3. **Location 3 (lines 378-380)**: This is where `alter_unique_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with only `{'unique': True}`, which could similarly have conflicts with regular index constraints.\n\n4. **Location 4 (lines 1154-1170)**: This is the filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` that needs to properly handle the case where both `unique=False` and `index=True` (or vice versa) are specified to exclude conflicting constraint types.\n\n**The fix strategy is clear:**\n- Modify locations 2 and 3 to pass more specific constraint filtering parameters\n- Location 1 will then receive these improved parameters and pass them to `_constraint_names()`\n- Location 4's existing logic should already handle the improved filtering correctly\n\n**Verification that the fix will work:**\nThe current `_constraint_names()` method already has the capability to filter by both `unique` and `index` parameters independently (lines 1156 and 1160). By passing `{'index': True, 'unique': False}` from location 2 and `{'unique': True, 'index': False}` from location 3, the method will properly exclude conflicting constraint types.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThese locations are ready for fixing. The bug is well-understood, the root cause is clear, and the fix strategy will resolve the core issue by making constraint filtering more specific to avoid conflicts between unique_together and index_together constraints on the same fields.",

`alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` at line 396\n   - `_delete_composed_index()` uses `_constraint_names()` to find matching constraints\n   - `_constraint_names()` queries the database introspection to get all constraints matching the columns\n   - When both unique and index constraints exist on same fields, it returns both constraint names\n   - The method fails because `len(constraint_names) != 1` (line 410)\n\n2. **Key Code Locations:**\n   - Bug location: Lines 402-416 in `schema.py`\n   - Called from: Line 396 (`alter_index_together`) and Line 380 (`alter_unique_together`)\n   - Constraint discovery: `_constraint_names()` method at lines 1142-1170\n\n3. **Current Logic Flaw:**\n   - The method doesn't properly filter constraints by type when multiple constraint types exist on the same columns\n   - It passes `{'index': True}` as `constraint_kwargs` but the filtering isn't specific enough\n\n## Tools Used and Results\n\n1. **explore_directory**: Mapped Django project structure\n2. **read_file_lines**: Examined the buggy `_delete_composed_index()` method and related code\n3. **search_code_with_context**: Located all references to the problematic method and related constraint handling code\n\n## Current Status\n- ✅ Bug location identified and understood\n- ✅ Root cause analysis completed  \n- ✅ Code flow and logic flaw documented\n- 🔄 **Next Steps Needed**: \n  - Create a test case to reproduce the bug\n  - Implement the fix to properly filter constraints by type\n  - Test the fix to ensure it doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Proposed Fix Strategy\nThe fix should modify `_delete_composed_index()` to be more specific about which type of constraint to delete, ensuring it only finds and deletes the intended constraint type (unique vs index) even when both exist on the same columns.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: Now let me see the complete `_constraint_names` method to understand how it works:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 1142, \"end_line\": 1170 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 1142-1170:\n\n1142:     def _constraint_names(self, model, column_names=None, unique=None,\n1143:                           primary_key=None, index=None, foreign_key=None,\n1144:                           check=None, type_=None, exclude=None):\n1145:         \"\"\"Return all constraint names matching the columns and conditions.\"\"\"\n1146:         if column_names is not None:\n1147:             column_names = [\n1148:                 self.connection.introspection.identifier_converter(name)\n1149:                 for name in column_names\n1150:             ]\n1151:         with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:\n1152:             constraints = self.connection.introspection.get_constraints(cursor, model._meta.db_table)\n1153:         result = []\n1154:         for name, infodict in constraints.items():\n1155:             if column_names is None or column_names == infodict['columns']:\n1156:                 if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:\n1157:                     continue\n1158:                 if primary_key is not None and infodict['primary_key'] != primary_key:\n1159:                     continue\n1160:                 if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n1161:                     continue\n1162:                 if check is not None and infodict['check'] != check:\n1163:                     continue\n1164:                 if foreign_key is not None and not infodict['foreign_key']:\n1165:                     continue\n1166:                 if type_ is not None and infodict['type'] != type_:\n1167:                     continue\n1168:                 if not exclude or name not in exclude:\n1169:                     result.append(name)\n1170:         return result\n\n\nAssistant: Now I have a complete understanding of the bug.

The method fails at line 410 because `len(constraint_names) != 1`\n\n**The Fix Strategy:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method has parameters for filtering by constraint type (`unique`, `index`, etc.) but the `_delete_composed_index()` method isn't using them properly. Looking at line 160 in `_constraint_names()`, it does check `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index`, so the filtering mechanism exists.\n\nThe issue is that `_delete_composed_index()` passes `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}` but needs to also specify that it doesn't want unique constraints when deleting index constraints.\n\nNow I need to identify the specific locations that need fixing to provide the precise line ranges for repair.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 402, \"end_line\": 416 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 402-416:\n\n 402:     def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):\n 403:         meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}\n 404:         meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}\n 405:         columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]\n 406:         constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n 407:             model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n 408:             **constraint_kwargs\n 409:         )\n 410:         if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n 411:             raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n 412:                 len(constraint_names),\n 413:                 model._meta.db_table,\n 414:                 \", \".join(columns),\n 415:             ))\n 416:         self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))\n\n\nAssistant: Now let me look at the specific calls to `_delete_composed_index()` to understand how the constraint_kwargs are passed:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 390, \"end_line\": 400 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 390-400:\n\n 390:         [\"foo\", \"bar\"] format.\n 391:         \"\"\"\n 392:         olds = {tuple(fields) for fields in old_index_together}\n 393:         news = {tuple(fields) for fields in new_index_together}\n 394:         # Deleted indexes\n 395:         for fields in olds.difference(news):\n 396:             self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n 397:         # Created indexes\n 398:         for field_names in news.difference(olds):\n 399:             fields = [model._meta.get_field(field) for field in field_names]\n 400:             self.execute(self._create_index_sql(model, fields, suffix=\"_idx\"))\n\n\nAssistant: Now let me check the `alter_unique_together` method to see how it handles the same situation:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\", \"start_line\": 370, \"end_line\": 390 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\nTotal lines: 1200\nShowing lines 370-390:\n\n 370:     def alter_unique_together(self, model, old_unique_together, new_unique_together):\n 371:         \"\"\"\n 372:         Deal with a model changing its unique_together.

Now I have all the information needed to identify the precise bug locations. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in the `_delete_composed_index()` method. When both `unique_together` and `index_together` exist on the same fields:\n\n1. **Line 396**: `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'index': True}`\n2. **Line 380**: `alter_unique_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with `{'unique': True}`\n3. **Lines 406-408**: `_delete_composed_index()` calls `_constraint_names()` with the constraint_kwargs\n4. **Line 410**: The method fails because it finds 2 constraints instead of 1\n\n**The Problem:**\nThe `_constraint_names()` method at lines 1154-1170 filters constraints, but when both unique and index constraints exist on the same columns, passing `{'index': True}` doesn't exclude unique constraints that also happen to be indexes.\n\nLooking at the `_constraint_names()` filtering logic:\n- Line 1160: `if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:` - this checks if the constraint is an index\n- Line 1156: `if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:` - this checks if the constraint is unique\n\nThe issue is that a unique constraint can also be an index (unique constraints are typically implemented as unique indexes in databases), so when we pass `{'index': True}`, both the unique constraint and the regular index constraint match.\n\n**The Fix:**\nThe `_delete_composed_index()` method needs to be more specific about which type of constraint to delete. When deleting an index_together, it should exclude unique constraints, and when deleting unique_together, it should exclude regular index constraints.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified:\n\n1. **Lines 406-408**: The `_constraint_names()` call in `_delete_composed_index()` needs to be more specific about filtering constraint types to avoid conflicts between unique and index constraints on the same fields.\n\n2. **Line 410**: The validation logic that expects exactly 1 constraint needs to be updated to handle the case where multiple constraint types exist on the same fields.\n\n3. **Line 396**: The call from `alter_index_together()` needs to pass additional parameters to exclude unique constraints when deleting index constraints.\n\n4. **Line 380**: The call from `alter_unique_together()` needs to pass additional parameters to exclude index constraints when deleting unique constraints.\n\n5. **Lines 1156-1160**: The filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` method needs to be enhanced to properly distinguish between different constraint types when both exist on the same columns.\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nBased on my complete analysis of the Django migration bug, I have identified the exact root cause and the specific locations that need to be fixed. The bug occurs when deleting an `index_together` constraint that shares the same fields as a `unique_together` constraint. The `_delete_composed_index()` method finds both constraints and fails because it expects exactly one.\n\nThe key locations that need fixing are:\n\n1. The main bug location in `_delete_composed_index()` method where the constraint filtering and validation occurs\n2. The calls from `alter_index_together()` and `alter_unique_together()` that don't properly distinguish constraint types\n3. The constraint filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` method\n\nLet me provide the precise locations for repair.\n\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 402,\n            \"end_line\": 416\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 394,\n            \"end_line\": 396\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 378,\n            \"end_line\": 380\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 1154,\n            \"end_line\": 1170\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nAssistant: PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django migration bug where deleting an `index_together` constraint fails when it shares the same fields as a `unique_together` constraint, here are my coordinated repair suggestions:\n\n1. **[Lines 402-416] `_delete_composed_index()` method**: Modify the constraint filtering logic to be more specific about constraint types. Instead of just passing `constraint_kwargs`, add explicit filtering to exclude conflicting constraint types. When deleting an index constraint, exclude unique constraints, and vice versa. This requires updating the `_constraint_names()` call to pass additional parameters like `unique=False` when `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`.\n\n2. **[Lines 394-396] `alter_index_together()` call**: Update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass more specific constraint filtering parameters. Change from `{'index': True}` to `{'index': True, 'unique': False}` to explicitly exclude unique constraints when deleting index_together constraints. This works in coordination with suggestion 1 to ensure only the intended constraint type is found.\n\n3. **[Lines 378-380] `alter_unique_together()` call**: Similarly, update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass `{'unique': True, 'index': False}` instead of just `{'unique': True}` to explicitly exclude regular index constraints when deleting unique_together constraints. This mirrors the fix in suggestion 2 and ensures symmetrical behavior.\n\n4. **[Lines 1154-1170] `_constraint_names()` filtering logic**: Enhance the constraint filtering to properly handle the case where both `unique` and `index` parameters are specified. The current logic at lines 1156 and 1160 handles them independently, but when both are specified (as suggested in fixes 1-3), ensure the filtering works correctly to exclude constraints that don't match both criteria.\n\nThese suggestions work together to solve the core issue: the `_delete_composed_index()` method currently finds multiple constraints because it doesn't properly distinguish between unique and index constraint types when they exist on the same fields. By making the constraint filtering more explicit and specific, we ensure that only the intended constraint type is found and deleted, resolving the \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\" error.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 402-416\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):\n        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}\n        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}\n        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]\n        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n            **constraint_kwargs\n        )\n        if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n            raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n                len(constraint_names),\n                model._meta.db_table,\n                \", \".join(columns),\n            ))\n        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 394-396\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        # Deleted indexes\n        for fields in olds.difference(news):\n            self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n\n\n[Location 3] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 378-380\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        # Deleted uniques\n        for fields in olds.difference(news):\n            self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'unique': True}, self.sql_delete_unique)\n\n\n[Location 4] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 1154-1170\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        for name, infodict in constraints.items():\n            if column_names is None or column_names == infodict['columns']:\n                if unique is not None and infodict['unique'] != unique:\n                    continue\n                if primary_key is not None and infodict['primary_key'] != primary_key:\n                    continue\n                if index is not None and infodict['index'] != index:\n                    continue\n                if check is not None and infodict['check'] != check:\n                    continue\n                if foreign_key is not None and not infodict['foreign_key']:\n                    continue\n                if type_ is not None and infodict['type'] != type_:\n                    continue\n                if not exclude or name not in exclude:\n                    result.append(name)\n        return result\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\nAssistant: Looking at the provided code segments and my earlier suggestions, I can see that these locations are exactly where the bug manifests and where fixes need to be implemented.\n\n**Analysis of the locations:**\n\n1. **Location 1 (lines 402-416)**: This is the core method `_delete_composed_index()` where the bug occurs. The method calls `_constraint_names()` with `constraint_kwargs` but doesn't properly filter out conflicting constraint types. This is where the \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\" error is raised.\n\n2. **Location 2 (lines 394-396)**: This is where `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with only `{'index': True}`, which doesn't exclude unique constraints that may exist on the same fields.\n\n3. **Location 3 (lines 378-380)**: This is where `alter_unique_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with only `{'unique': True}`, which could similarly have conflicts with regular index constraints.\n\n4. **Location 4 (lines 1154-1170)**: This is the filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` that needs to properly handle the case where both `unique=False` and `index=True` (or vice versa) are specified to exclude conflicting constraint types.\n\n**The fix strategy is clear:**\n- Modify locations 2 and 3 to pass more specific constraint filtering parameters\n- Location 1 will then receive these improved parameters and pass them to `_constraint_names()`\n- Location 4's existing logic should already handle the improved filtering correctly\n\n**Verification that the fix will work:**\nThe current `_constraint_names()` method already has the capability to filter by both `unique` and `index` parameters independently (lines 1156 and 1160).

Instead of just passing `constraint_kwargs`, add explicit filtering to exclude conflicting constraint types. When deleting an index constraint, exclude unique constraints, and vice versa. This requires updating the `_constraint_names()` call to pass additional parameters like `unique=False` when `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`.\n\n2. **[Lines 394-396] `alter_index_together()` call**: Update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass more specific constraint filtering parameters. Change from `{'index': True}` to `{'index': True, 'unique': False}` to explicitly exclude unique constraints when deleting index_together constraints. This works in coordination with suggestion 1 to ensure only the intended constraint type is found.\n\n3. **[Lines 378-380] `alter_unique_together()` call**: Similarly, update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass `{'unique': True, 'index': False}` instead of just `{'unique': True}` to explicitly exclude regular index constraints when deleting unique_together constraints. This mirrors the fix in suggestion 2 and ensures symmetrical behavior.\n\n4. **[Lines 1154-1170] `_constraint_names()` filtering logic**: Enhance the constraint filtering to properly handle the case where both `unique` and `index` parameters are specified. The current logic at lines 1156 and 1160 handles them independently, but when both are specified (as suggested in fixes 1-3), ensure the filtering works correctly to exclude constraints that don't match both criteria.\n\nThese suggestions work together to solve the core issue: the `_delete_composed_index()` method currently finds multiple constraints because it doesn't properly distinguish between unique and index constraint types when they exist on the same fields. By making the constraint filtering more explicit and specific, we ensure that only the intended constraint type is found and deleted, resolving the \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\" error.\n\nYou may search or reference other code if necessary.\n\n**When you're ready, start your reply with '#PROPOSE PATCH' and then include all  code blocks.**\n#PROPOSE PATCH\n```python\n<patch_1>\n```\n```python\n<patch_2>\n```\n...\n\n\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that:\n1.

The method calls `_constraint_names()` with `constraint_kwargs` but doesn't properly filter out conflicting constraint types. This is where the \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\" error is raised.\n\n2. **Location 2 (lines 394-396)**: This is where `alter_index_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with only `{'index': True}`, which doesn't exclude unique constraints that may exist on the same fields.\n\n3. **Location 3 (lines 378-380)**: This is where `alter_unique_together()` calls `_delete_composed_index()` with only `{'unique': True}`, which could similarly have conflicts with regular index constraints.\n\n4. **Location 4 (lines 1154-1170)**: This is the filtering logic in `_constraint_names()` that needs to properly handle the case where both `unique=False` and `index=True` (or vice versa) are specified to exclude conflicting constraint types.\n\n**The fix strategy is clear:**\n- Modify locations 2 and 3 to pass more specific constraint filtering parameters\n- Location 1 will then receive these improved parameters and pass them to `_constraint_names()`\n- Location 4's existing logic should already handle the improved filtering correctly\n\n**Verification that the fix will work:**\nThe current `_constraint_names()` method already has the capability to filter by both `unique` and `index` parameters independently (lines 1156 and 1160). By passing `{'index': True, 'unique': False}` from location 2 and `{'unique': True, 'index': False}` from location 3, the method will properly exclude conflicting constraint types.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nThese locations are ready for fixing. The bug is well-understood, the root cause is clear, and the fix strategy will resolve the core issue by making constraint filtering more specific to avoid conflicts between unique_together and index_together constraints on the same fields.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 402-416\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import logging\n  from datetime import datetime\n  from django.db.backends.ddl_references import (\n  from django.db.backends.utils import names_digest, split_identifier\n  from django.db.models import Index\n  from django.db.transaction import TransactionManagementError, atomic\n  from django.utils import timezone\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  392:         olds = {tuple(fields) for fields in old_index_together}\n[C]  393:         news = {tuple(fields) for fields in new_index_together}\n[C]  394:         # Deleted indexes\n[C]  395:         for fields in olds.difference(news):\n[C]  396:             self._delete_composed_index(model, fields, {'index': True}, self.sql_delete_index)\n[C]  397:         # Created indexes\n[C]  398:         for field_names in news.difference(olds):\n[C]  399:             fields = [model._meta.get_field(field) for field in field_names]\n[C]  400:             self.execute(self._create_index_sql(model, fields, suffix=\"_idx\"))\n[C]  401: \n[R]  402:     def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):\n[R]  403:         meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}\n[R]  404:         meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}\n[R]  405:         columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]\n[R]  406:         constraint_names = self._constraint_names(\n[R]  407:             model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,\n[R]  408:             **constraint_kwargs\n[R]  409:         )\n[R]  410:         if len(constraint_names) != 1:\n[R]  411:             raise ValueError(\"Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)\" % (\n[R]  412:                 len(constraint_names),\n[R]  413:                 model._meta.db_table,\n[R]  414:                 \", \".join(columns),\n[R]  415:             ))\n[R]  416:         self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))\n[C]  417: \n[C]  418:     def alter_db_table(self, model, old_db_table, new_db_table):\n[C]  419:         \"\"\"Rename the table a model points to.\"\"\"\n[C]  420:         if (old_db_table == new_db_table or\n[C]  421:             (self.connection.features.ignores_table_name_case and\n[C]  422:                 old_db_table.lower() == new_db_table.lower())):\n[C]  423:             return\n[C]  424:         self.execute(self.sql_rename_table % {\n[C]  425:             \"old_table\": self.quote_name(old_db_table),\n[C]  426:             \"new_table\": self.quote_name(new_db_table),\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py lines 394-396\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import logging\n  from datetime import datetime\n  from django.db.backends.ddl_references import (\n  from django.db.backends.utils import names_digest, split_identifier\n  from django.db.models import Index\n  from django.db.transaction import TransactionManagementError, atomic\n  from django.utils import timezone\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  384:             self.execute(self._create_unique_sql(model, columns))\n[C]  385: \n[C]  386:     def alter_index_together(self, model, old_index_together, new_index_together):\n[C]  387:         \"\"\"\n[C]  388:         Deal with a model changing its index_together.

Instead of just passing `constraint_kwargs`, add explicit filtering to exclude conflicting constraint types. When deleting an index constraint, exclude unique constraints, and vice versa. This requires updating the `_constraint_names()` call to pass additional parameters like `unique=False` when `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`.\n\n2. **[Lines 394-396] `alter_index_together()` call**: Update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass more specific constraint filtering parameters. Change from `{'index': True}` to `{'index': True, 'unique': False}` to explicitly exclude unique constraints when deleting index_together constraints. This works in coordination with suggestion 1 to ensure only the intended constraint type is found.\n\n3. **[Lines 378-380] `alter_unique_together()` call**: Similarly, update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass `{'unique': True, 'index': False}` instead of just `{'unique': True}` to explicitly exclude regular index constraints when deleting unique_together constraints. This mirrors the fix in suggestion 2 and ensures symmetrical behavior.\n\n4. **[Lines 1154-1170] `_constraint_names()` filtering logic**: Enhance the constraint filtering to properly handle the case where both `unique` and `index` parameters are specified. The current logic at lines 1156 and 1160 handles them independently, but when both are specified (as suggested in fixes 1-3), ensure the filtering works correctly to exclude constraints that don't match both criteria.\n\nThese suggestions work together to solve the core issue: the `_delete_composed_index()` method currently finds multiple constraints because it doesn't properly distinguish between unique and index constraint types when they exist on the same fields.

Instead of just passing `constraint_kwargs`, add explicit filtering to exclude conflicting constraint types. When deleting an index constraint, exclude unique constraints, and vice versa. This requires updating the `_constraint_names()` call to pass additional parameters like `unique=False` when `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`.\n\n2. **[Lines 394-396] `alter_index_together()` call**: Update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass more specific constraint filtering parameters. Change from `{'index': True}` to `{'index': True, 'unique': False}` to explicitly exclude unique constraints when deleting index_together constraints. This works in coordination with suggestion 1 to ensure only the intended constraint type is found.\n\n3. **[Lines 378-380] `alter_unique_together()` call**: Similarly, update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass `{'unique': True, 'index': False}` instead of just `{'unique': True}` to explicitly exclude regular index constraints when deleting unique_together constraints. This mirrors the fix in suggestion 2 and ensures symmetrical behavior.\n\n4. **[Lines 1154-1170] `_constraint_names()` filtering logic**: Enhance the constraint filtering to properly handle the case where both `unique` and `index` parameters are specified. The current logic at lines 1156 and 1160 handles them independently, but when both are specified (as suggested in fixes 1-3), ensure the filtering works correctly to exclude constraints that don't match both criteria.\n\nThese suggestions work together to solve the core issue: the `_delete_composed_index()` method currently finds multiple constraints because it doesn't properly distinguish between unique and index constraint types when they exist on the same fields. By making the constraint filtering more explicit and specific, we ensure that only the intended constraint type is found and deleted, resolving the \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\" error.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

Instead of just passing `constraint_kwargs`, add explicit filtering to exclude conflicting constraint types. When deleting an index constraint, exclude unique constraints, and vice versa. This requires updating the `_constraint_names()` call to pass additional parameters like `unique=False` when `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`.\n\n2. **[Lines 394-396] `alter_index_together()` call**: Update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass more specific constraint filtering parameters. Change from `{'index': True}` to `{'index': True, 'unique': False}` to explicitly exclude unique constraints when deleting index_together constraints. This works in coordination with suggestion 1 to ensure only the intended constraint type is found.\n\n3. **[Lines 378-380] `alter_unique_together()` call**: Similarly, update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass `{'unique': True, 'index': False}` instead of just `{'unique': True}` to explicitly exclude regular index constraints when deleting unique_together constraints. This mirrors the fix in suggestion 2 and ensures symmetrical behavior.\n\n4. **[Lines 1154-1170] `_constraint_names()` filtering logic**: Enhance the constraint filtering to properly handle the case where both `unique` and `index` parameters are specified. The current logic at lines 1156 and 1160 handles them independently, but when both are specified (as suggested in fixes 1-3), ensure the filtering works correctly to exclude constraints that don't match both criteria.\n\nThese suggestions work together to solve the core issue: the `_delete_composed_index()` method currently finds multiple constraints because it doesn't properly distinguish between unique and index constraint types when they exist on the same fields. By making the constraint filtering more explicit and specific, we ensure that only the intended constraint type is found and deleted, resolving the \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\" error.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

Instead of just passing `constraint_kwargs`, add explicit filtering to exclude conflicting constraint types. When deleting an index constraint, exclude unique constraints, and vice versa. This requires updating the `_constraint_names()` call to pass additional parameters like `unique=False` when `constraint_kwargs={'index': True}`.\n\n2. **[Lines 394-396] `alter_index_together()` call**: Update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass more specific constraint filtering parameters. Change from `{'index': True}` to `{'index': True, 'unique': False}` to explicitly exclude unique constraints when deleting index_together constraints. This works in coordination with suggestion 1 to ensure only the intended constraint type is found.\n\n3. **[Lines 378-380] `alter_unique_together()` call**: Similarly, update the call to `_delete_composed_index()` to pass `{'unique': True, 'index': False}` instead of just `{'unique': True}` to explicitly exclude regular index constraints when deleting unique_together constraints. This mirrors the fix in suggestion 2 and ensures symmetrical behavior.\n\n4. **[Lines 1154-1170] `_constraint_names()` filtering logic**: Enhance the constraint filtering to properly handle the case where both `unique` and `index` parameters are specified. The current logic at lines 1156 and 1160 handles them independently, but when both are specified (as suggested in fixes 1-3), ensure the filtering works correctly to exclude constraints that don't match both criteria.\n\nThese suggestions work together to solve the core issue: the `_delete_composed_index()` method currently finds multiple constraints because it doesn't properly distinguish between unique and index constraint types when they exist on the same fields. By making the constraint filtering more explicit and specific, we ensure that only the intended constraint type is found and deleted, resolving the \"Found wrong number (2) of constraints\" error.\n\nInstructions:\n- Please propose a complete, corrected Python code snippet to fix this location\n- Pay attention to indentation and match the surrounding context\n- Do NOT add duplicate imports that already exist above\n- Wrap your code in a ```python ``` block\n- Output only the corrected code without additional explanations",

Instead of just passing `constraint_kwargs`, add explicit filtering to exclude conflicting constraint types. When deleting an index constraint, exclude unique constraints, and vice versa.

This mirrors the fix in suggestion 2 and ensures symmetrical behavior.\n\n4. **[Lines 1154-1170] `_constraint_names()` filtering logic**: Enhance the constraint filtering to properly handle the case where both `unique` and `index` parameters are specified.
