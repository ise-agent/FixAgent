Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Bug**: In line 91 of `resolve_redirects`, the code does `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the start of each iteration in the while loop. This means it always copies the **original** request (`req`) instead of the **current** request that may have been modified in previous iterations.\n\n2. **The Problem**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n   - First redirect (303): POST gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n   - Second redirect (307): Should preserve the GET, but because it copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly uses POST method\n\n3. **The Fix**: The code should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req` parameter.\n\nLet me continue reading to see the end of the method and understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 181, \"end_line\": 200 }",

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Bug**: In line 91 of `resolve_redirects`, the code does `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the start of each iteration in the while loop. This means it always copies the **original** request (`req`) instead of the **current** request that may have been modified in previous iterations.\n\n2. **The Problem**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n   - First redirect (303): POST gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n   - Second redirect (307): Should preserve the GET, but because it copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly uses POST method\n\n3. **The Fix**: The code should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req` parameter.\n\nLet me continue reading to see the end of the method and understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 181, \"end_line\": 200 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 571\nShowing lines 181-200:\n\n 181:             extract_cookies_to_jar(self.cookies, prepared_request, resp.raw)\n 182: \n 183:             i += 1\n 184:             yield resp\n 185: \n 186: \n 187: class Session(SessionRedirectMixin):\n 188:     \"\"\"A Requests session.\n 189: \n 190:     Provides cookie persistence, connection-pooling, and configuration.\n 191: \n 192:     Basic Usage::\n 193: \n 194:       >>> import requests\n 195:       >>> s = requests.Session()\n 196:       >>> s.get('http://httpbin.org/get')\n 197:       200\n 198:     \"\"\"\n 199: \n 200:     __attrs__ = [\n\nLet's analyze collected context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1. What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\n`Session.resolve_redirects` copies the original request for all subsequent requests, can cause incorrect method selection\nConsider the following redirection chain:\n\n```\nPOST /do_something HTTP/1.1\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 303 See Other\nLocation: /new_thing_1513\n\nGET /new_thing_1513\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect\nLocation: //failover.example.com/new_thing_1513\n```\n\nThe intermediate 303 See Other has caused the POST to be converted to\na GET.

Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Bug**: In line 91 of `resolve_redirects`, the code does `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the start of each iteration in the while loop. This means it always copies the **original** request (`req`) instead of the **current** request that may have been modified in previous iterations.\n\n2. **The Problem**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n   - First redirect (303): POST gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n   - Second redirect (307): Should preserve the GET, but because it copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly uses POST method\n\n3. **The Fix**: The code should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req` parameter.\n\nLet me continue reading to see the end of the method and understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 181, \"end_line\": 200 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 571\nShowing lines 181-200:\n\n 181:             extract_cookies_to_jar(self.cookies, prepared_request, resp.raw)\n 182: \n 183:             i += 1\n 184:             yield resp\n 185: \n 186: \n 187: class Session(SessionRedirectMixin):\n 188:     \"\"\"A Requests session.\n 189: \n 190:     Provides cookie persistence, connection-pooling, and configuration.\n 191: \n 192:     Basic Usage::\n 193: \n 194:       >>> import requests\n 195:       >>> s = requests.Session()\n 196:       >>> s.get('http://httpbin.org/get')\n 197:       200\n 198:     \"\"\"\n 199: \n 200:     __attrs__ = [\n\n\nAssistant: Perfect!

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the main requests library structure at `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/`\n- **Key Files Identified**: `sessions.py` (contains the buggy method), `test_requests.py` (test suite)\n\n### 2. Bug Location and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `Session.resolve_redirects` method in `sessions.py` (lines 84-185)\n- **Bug Identified**: Line 91 contains `prepared_request = req.copy()` which always copies the **original** request parameter instead of the current modified request\n\n### 3. Technical Analysis of the Bug\n\n**Problem Scenario**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n- **First redirect (303)**: POST correctly gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n- **Second redirect (307)**: Should preserve the GET method, but because line 91 copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly reverts to POST method\n\n**Root Cause**: The `while resp.is_redirect:` loop (line 90) always copies from the original `req` parameter rather than maintaining state from previous iterations.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located and analyzed the buggy `resolve_redirects` method\n- Identified the exact line causing the issue (line 91)\n- Understood the technical impact on redirect chain handling\n- Mapped out the method's complete flow (lines 84-185)\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Need to examine existing tests to understand expected behavior\n- Need to implement the fix\n\n### ❌ Not Started\n- Creating/running tests to verify the fix\n- Testing the repair implementation\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n**Bug Location**: `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py`, line 91\n```python\n# BUGGY CODE:\nprepared_request = req.copy()  # Always copies original request\n\n# SHOULD BE:\n# For first iteration: copy original request\n# For subsequent iterations: copy the current prepared_request to maintain state\n```\n\n**Method Context**: \n- Part of `SessionRedirectMixin` class\n- Handles HTTP redirect logic with proper method conversion (POST→GET for 303, etc.)\n- Manages cookies, headers, and authentication during redirects\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify line 91 to properly handle request copying in redirect chains\n2. **Test Verification**: Run existing tests and create new ones to verify the fix works for complex redirect scenarios\n3. **Validation**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Project structure navigation\n- `search_code_with_context`: Method location\n- `read_file_lines`: Detailed code analysis\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the root cause and location of the bug.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Summary: Bug Investigation and Repair in Requests Library\n\n## Main Objective\nIdentify and fix a bug in the `Session.resolve_redirects` method where it incorrectly copies the original request instead of the current request, causing HTTP method selection issues in redirect chains.\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the main requests library structure at `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/`\n- **Key Files Identified**: `sessions.py` (contains the buggy method), `test_requests.py` (test suite)\n\n### 2. Bug Location and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `Session.resolve_redirects` method in `sessions.py` (lines 84-185)\n- **Bug Identified**: Line 91 contains `prepared_request = req.copy()` which always copies the **original** request parameter instead of the current modified request\n\n### 3. Technical Analysis of the Bug\n\n**Problem Scenario**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n- **First redirect (303)**: POST correctly gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n- **Second redirect (307)**: Should preserve the GET method, but because line 91 copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly reverts to POST method\n\n**Root Cause**: The `while resp.is_redirect:` loop (line 90) always copies from the original `req` parameter rather than maintaining state from previous iterations.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located and analyzed the buggy `resolve_redirects` method\n- Identified the exact line causing the issue (line 91)\n- Understood the technical impact on redirect chain handling\n- Mapped out the method's complete flow (lines 84-185)\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Need to examine existing tests to understand expected behavior\n- Need to implement the fix\n\n### ❌ Not Started\n- Creating/running tests to verify the fix\n- Testing the repair implementation\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n**Bug Location**: `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py`, line 91\n```python\n# BUGGY CODE:\nprepared_request = req.copy()  # Always copies original request\n\n# SHOULD BE:\n# For first iteration: copy original request\n# For subsequent iterations: copy the current prepared_request to maintain state\n```\n\n**Method Context**: \n- Part of `SessionRedirectMixin` class\n- Handles HTTP redirect logic with proper method conversion (POST→GET for 303, etc.)\n- Manages cookies, headers, and authentication during redirects\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify line 91 to properly handle request copying in redirect chains\n2. **Test Verification**: Run existing tests and create new ones to verify the fix works for complex redirect scenarios\n3. **Validation**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Project structure navigation\n- `search_code_with_context`: Method location\n- `read_file_lines`: Detailed code analysis\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the root cause and location of the bug. The fix requires modifying the request copying logic to maintain state across redirect iterations.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug clearly. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Bug**: In line 91 of `resolve_redirects`, the code does `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the start of each iteration in the while loop. This means it always copies the **original** request (`req`) instead of the **current** request that may have been modified in previous iterations.\n\n2. **The Problem**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n   - First redirect (303): POST gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n   - Second redirect (307): Should preserve the GET, but because it copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly uses POST method\n\n3. **The Fix**: The code should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req` parameter.\n\nLet me continue reading to see the end of the method and understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 181, \"end_line\": 200 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 571\nShowing lines 181-200:\n\n 181:             extract_cookies_to_jar(self.cookies, prepared_request, resp.raw)\n 182: \n 183:             i += 1\n 184:             yield resp\n 185: \n 186: \n 187: class Session(SessionRedirectMixin):\n 188:     \"\"\"A Requests session.\n 189: \n 190:     Provides cookie persistence, connection-pooling, and configuration.\n 191: \n 192:     Basic Usage::\n 193: \n 194:       >>> import requests\n 195:       >>> s = requests.Session()\n 196:       >>> s.get('http://httpbin.org/get')\n 197:       200\n 198:     \"\"\"\n 199: \n 200:     __attrs__ = [\n\nPerfect!

context first.\nIf an API call could not find any code, you should think about what other API calls you can make to get more context.\nIf an API call returns some result, you should analyze the result and think about these questions:\n1. What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\n`Session.resolve_redirects` copies the original request for all subsequent requests, can cause incorrect method selection\nConsider the following redirection chain:\n\n```\nPOST /do_something HTTP/1.1\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 303 See Other\nLocation: /new_thing_1513\n\nGET /new_thing_1513\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect\nLocation: //failover.example.com/new_thing_1513\n```\n\nThe intermediate 303 See Other has caused the POST to be converted to\na GET.  The subsequent 307 should preserve the GET.  However, because\n`Session.resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the _original_\nrequest object, Requests will issue a POST!\n\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I have a complete understanding of the bug and the codebase. Let me summarize what I've found:\n\n**The Bug**: In `Session.resolve_redirects` method at line 91, the code does `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the start of each iteration in the while loop. This always copies the **original** request parameter instead of the **current** request that may have been modified in previous iterations.\n\n**The Problem Scenario**: \n1. POST request gets 303 See Other redirect → correctly converts to GET (lines 124-126)\n2. GET request gets 307 Temporary Redirect → should preserve GET method\n3. But because line 91 copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly reverts to POST method\n\n**The Fix Needed**: The code should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration for subsequent redirects, not always the original `req` parameter.\n\n**Current Status**: I have identified the exact location and nature of the bug. The fix is straightforward - modify line 91 to handle the first iteration differently from subsequent iterations.\n\nNow I have enough information to provide the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\nBased on my analysis of the `Session.resolve_redirects` method in `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py`, I have identified the precise location where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n**Primary Bug Location:**\n- **Line 91**: `prepared_request = req.copy()` - This line incorrectly copies the original request parameter (`req`) at the start of each iteration in the redirect loop, instead of preserving the modified request from previous iterations.\n\n**Related Context Lines:**\n- **Lines 90-95**: The while loop structure and request preparation logic that needs to be modified to handle first vs. subsequent iterations differently\n- **Lines 124-126**: The method conversion logic for 303 redirects (POST→GET) that works correctly but gets overridden by the bug in line 91\n- **Lines 84-89**: Method signature and initial setup that establishes the original request parameter\n- **Lines 183-185**: End of the loop where the iteration counter is incremented and response is yielded\n\nThe bug manifests when there are multiple redirects in a chain where an intermediate redirect (like 303 See Other) changes the HTTP method, but subsequent redirects (like 307 Temporary Redirect) should preserve that changed method. Instead, the code reverts to the original method because it always copies from the original request parameter.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**",

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the main requests library structure at `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/`\n- **Key Files Identified**: `sessions.py` (contains the buggy method), `test_requests.py` (test suite)\n\n### 2. Bug Location and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `Session.resolve_redirects` method in `sessions.py` (lines 84-185)\n- **Bug Identified**: Line 91 contains `prepared_request = req.copy()` which always copies the **original** request parameter instead of the current modified request\n\n### 3. Technical Analysis of the Bug\n\n**Problem Scenario**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n- **First redirect (303)**: POST correctly gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n- **Second redirect (307)**: Should preserve the GET method, but because line 91 copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly reverts to POST method\n\n**Root Cause**: The `while resp.is_redirect:` loop (line 90) always copies from the original `req` parameter rather than maintaining state from previous iterations.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located and analyzed the buggy `resolve_redirects` method\n- Identified the exact line causing the issue (line 91)\n- Understood the technical impact on redirect chain handling\n- Mapped out the method's complete flow (lines 84-185)\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Need to examine existing tests to understand expected behavior\n- Need to implement the fix\n\n### ❌ Not Started\n- Creating/running tests to verify the fix\n- Testing the repair implementation\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n**Bug Location**: `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py`, line 91\n```python\n# BUGGY CODE:\nprepared_request = req.copy()  # Always copies original request\n\n# SHOULD BE:\n# For first iteration: copy original request\n# For subsequent iterations: copy the current prepared_request to maintain state\n```\n\n**Method Context**: \n- Part of `SessionRedirectMixin` class\n- Handles HTTP redirect logic with proper method conversion (POST→GET for 303, etc.)\n- Manages cookies, headers, and authentication during redirects\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify line 91 to properly handle request copying in redirect chains\n2. **Test Verification**: Run existing tests and create new ones to verify the fix works for complex redirect scenarios\n3. **Validation**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Project structure navigation\n- `search_code_with_context`: Method location\n- `read_file_lines`: Detailed code analysis\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the root cause and location of the bug. The fix requires modifying the request copying logic to maintain state across redirect iterations.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug clearly. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Bug**: In line 91 of `resolve_redirects`, the code does `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the start of each iteration in the while loop. This means it always copies the **original** request (`req`) instead of the **current** request that may have been modified in previous iterations.\n\n2. **The Problem**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n   - First redirect (303): POST gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n   - Second redirect (307): Should preserve the GET, but because it copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly uses POST method\n\n3. **The Fix**: The code should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req` parameter.\n\nLet me continue reading to see the end of the method and understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 181, \"end_line\": 200 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 571\nShowing lines 181-200:\n\n 181:             extract_cookies_to_jar(self.cookies, prepared_request, resp.raw)\n 182: \n 183:             i += 1\n 184:             yield resp\n 185: \n 186: \n 187: class Session(SessionRedirectMixin):\n 188:     \"\"\"A Requests session.\n 189: \n 190:     Provides cookie persistence, connection-pooling, and configuration.\n 191: \n 192:     Basic Usage::\n 193: \n 194:       >>> import requests\n 195:       >>> s = requests.Session()\n 196:       >>> s.get('http://httpbin.org/get')\n 197:       200\n 198:     \"\"\"\n 199: \n 200:     __attrs__ = [\n\nPerfect!

complete understanding of the bug and the codebase. Let me summarize what I've found:\n\n**The Bug**: In `Session.resolve_redirects` method at line 91, the code does `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the start of each iteration in the while loop. This always copies the **original** request parameter instead of the **current** request that may have been modified in previous iterations.\n\n**The Problem Scenario**: \n1. POST request gets 303 See Other redirect → correctly converts to GET (lines 124-126)\n2. GET request gets 307 Temporary Redirect → should preserve GET method\n3. But because line 91 copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly reverts to POST method\n\n**The Fix Needed**: The code should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration for subsequent redirects, not always the original `req` parameter.\n\n**Current Status**: I have identified the exact location and nature of the bug. The fix is straightforward - modify line 91 to handle the first iteration differently from subsequent iterations.\n\nNow I have enough information to provide the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\nBased on my analysis of the `Session.resolve_redirects` method in `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py`, I have identified the precise location where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n**Primary Bug Location:**\n- **Line 91**: `prepared_request = req.copy()` - This line incorrectly copies the original request parameter (`req`) at the start of each iteration in the redirect loop, instead of preserving the modified request from previous iterations.\n\n**Related Context Lines:**\n- **Lines 90-95**: The while loop structure and request preparation logic that needs to be modified to handle first vs. subsequent iterations differently\n- **Lines 124-126**: The method conversion logic for 303 redirects (POST→GET) that works correctly but gets overridden by the bug in line 91\n- **Lines 84-89**: Method signature and initial setup that establishes the original request parameter\n- **Lines 183-185**: End of the loop where the iteration counter is incremented and response is yielded\n\nThe bug manifests when there are multiple redirects in a chain where an intermediate redirect (like 303 See Other) changes the HTTP method, but subsequent redirects (like 307 Temporary Redirect) should preserve that changed method. Instead, the code reverts to the original method because it always copies from the original request parameter.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nThe problem statement the project is:\n`Session.resolve_redirects` copies the original request for all subsequent requests, can cause incorrect method selection\nConsider the following redirection chain:\n\n```\nPOST /do_something HTTP/1.1\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 303 See Other\nLocation: /new_thing_1513\n\nGET /new_thing_1513\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect\nLocation: //failover.example.com/new_thing_1513\n```\n\nThe intermediate 303 See Other has caused the POST to be converted to\na GET.  The subsequent 307 should preserve the GET.  However, because\n`Session.resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the _original_\nrequest object, Requests will issue a POST!\n\n\nNow, please provide at most 5 suspicious locations at once and output them in the format of a JSON list. It must follow the following structure:  example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/viewcode.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 181,\n            \"end_line\": 276\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects/sphinx/sphinx/ext/viewcode.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 160,\n            \"end_line\": 178\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n                ",
    "response": "PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the `Session.resolve_redirects` method and the problem description, I have identified the precise locations where the bug occurs and needs to be fixed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 90,\n            \"end_line\": 95\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 124,\n            \"end_line\": 126\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Lines 90-95**: This is the core bug location where the while loop starts each iteration by copying the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()` at line 91). This needs to be modified to copy the current prepared_request for subsequent iterations instead of always copying the original request.\n\n2. **Lines 124-126**: This is the method conversion logic for 303 redirects that correctly converts POST to GET, but its effect gets overridden by the bug in line 91 during subsequent redirects. This location shows the intended behavior that should be preserved across redirect chains.\n\nThe bug manifests exactly as described in the problem statement: when a POST request gets a 303 See Other redirect (correctly converting to GET), followed by a 307 Temporary Redirect (which should preserve the GET method), the code incorrectly reverts to POST because it copies the original request instead of the modified one.",

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the main requests library structure at `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/`\n- **Key Files Identified**: `sessions.py` (contains the buggy method), `test_requests.py` (test suite)\n\n### 2. Bug Location and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `Session.resolve_redirects` method in `sessions.py` (lines 84-185)\n- **Bug Identified**: Line 91 contains `prepared_request = req.copy()` which always copies the **original** request parameter instead of the current modified request\n\n### 3. Technical Analysis of the Bug\n\n**Problem Scenario**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n- **First redirect (303)**: POST correctly gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n- **Second redirect (307)**: Should preserve the GET method, but because line 91 copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly reverts to POST method\n\n**Root Cause**: The `while resp.is_redirect:` loop (line 90) always copies from the original `req` parameter rather than maintaining state from previous iterations.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located and analyzed the buggy `resolve_redirects` method\n- Identified the exact line causing the issue (line 91)\n- Understood the technical impact on redirect chain handling\n- Mapped out the method's complete flow (lines 84-185)\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Need to examine existing tests to understand expected behavior\n- Need to implement the fix\n\n### ❌ Not Started\n- Creating/running tests to verify the fix\n- Testing the repair implementation\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n**Bug Location**: `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py`, line 91\n```python\n# BUGGY CODE:\nprepared_request = req.copy()  # Always copies original request\n\n# SHOULD BE:\n# For first iteration: copy original request\n# For subsequent iterations: copy the current prepared_request to maintain state\n```\n\n**Method Context**: \n- Part of `SessionRedirectMixin` class\n- Handles HTTP redirect logic with proper method conversion (POST→GET for 303, etc.)\n- Manages cookies, headers, and authentication during redirects\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify line 91 to properly handle request copying in redirect chains\n2. **Test Verification**: Run existing tests and create new ones to verify the fix works for complex redirect scenarios\n3. **Validation**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Project structure navigation\n- `search_code_with_context`: Method location\n- `read_file_lines`: Detailed code analysis\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the root cause and location of the bug. The fix requires modifying the request copying logic to maintain state across redirect iterations.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\nStart line: 90\nEnd line: 95\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\nStart line: 124\nEnd line: 126\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\n#REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug clearly. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Bug**: In line 91 of `resolve_redirects`, the code does `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the start of each iteration in the while loop. This means it always copies the **original** request (`req`) instead of the **current** request that may have been modified in previous iterations.\n\n2. **The Problem**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n   - First redirect (303): POST gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n   - Second redirect (307): Should preserve the GET, but because it copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly uses POST method\n\n3. **The Fix**: The code should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req` parameter.\n\nLet me continue reading to see the end of the method and understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 181, \"end_line\": 200 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 571\nShowing lines 181-200:\n\n 181:             extract_cookies_to_jar(self.cookies, prepared_request, resp.raw)\n 182: \n 183:             i += 1\n 184:             yield resp\n 185: \n 186: \n 187: class Session(SessionRedirectMixin):\n 188:     \"\"\"A Requests session.\n 189: \n 190:     Provides cookie persistence, connection-pooling, and configuration.\n 191: \n 192:     Basic Usage::\n 193: \n 194:       >>> import requests\n 195:       >>> s = requests.Session()\n 196:       >>> s.get('http://httpbin.org/get')\n 197:       200\n 198:     \"\"\"\n 199: \n 200:     __attrs__ = [\n\nPerfect!

complete understanding of the bug and the codebase. Let me summarize what I've found:\n\n**The Bug**: In `Session.resolve_redirects` method at line 91, the code does `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the start of each iteration in the while loop. This always copies the **original** request parameter instead of the **current** request that may have been modified in previous iterations.\n\n**The Problem Scenario**: \n1. POST request gets 303 See Other redirect → correctly converts to GET (lines 124-126)\n2. GET request gets 307 Temporary Redirect → should preserve GET method\n3. But because line 91 copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly reverts to POST method\n\n**The Fix Needed**: The code should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration for subsequent redirects, not always the original `req` parameter.\n\n**Current Status**: I have identified the exact location and nature of the bug. The fix is straightforward - modify line 91 to handle the first iteration differently from subsequent iterations.\n\nNow I have enough information to provide the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\nBased on my analysis of the `Session.resolve_redirects` method in `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py`, I have identified the precise location where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n**Primary Bug Location:**\n- **Line 91**: `prepared_request = req.copy()` - This line incorrectly copies the original request parameter (`req`) at the start of each iteration in the redirect loop, instead of preserving the modified request from previous iterations.\n\n**Related Context Lines:**\n- **Lines 90-95**: The while loop structure and request preparation logic that needs to be modified to handle first vs. subsequent iterations differently\n- **Lines 124-126**: The method conversion logic for 303 redirects (POST→GET) that works correctly but gets overridden by the bug in line 91\n- **Lines 84-89**: Method signature and initial setup that establishes the original request parameter\n- **Lines 183-185**: End of the loop where the iteration counter is incremented and response is yielded\n\nThe bug manifests when there are multiple redirects in a chain where an intermediate redirect (like 303 See Other) changes the HTTP method, but subsequent redirects (like 307 Temporary Redirect) should preserve that changed method. Instead, the code reverts to the original method because it always copies from the original request parameter.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the `Session.resolve_redirects` method and the problem description, I have identified the precise locations where the bug occurs and needs to be fixed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 90,\n            \"end_line\": 95\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 124,\n            \"end_line\": 126\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Lines 90-95**: This is the core bug location where the while loop starts each iteration by copying the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()` at line 91). This needs to be modified to copy the current prepared_request for subsequent iterations instead of always copying the original request.\n\n2. **Lines 124-126**: This is the method conversion logic for 303 redirects that correctly converts POST to GET, but its effect gets overridden by the bug in line 91 during subsequent redirects. This location shows the intended behavior that should be preserved across redirect chains.\n\nThe bug manifests exactly as described in the problem statement: when a POST request gets a 303 See Other redirect (correctly converting to GET), followed by a 307 Temporary Redirect (which should preserve the GET method), the code incorrectly reverts to POST because it copies the original request instead of the modified one.\nThe problem statement the project is:\n`Session.resolve_redirects` copies the original request for all subsequent requests, can cause incorrect method selection\nConsider the following redirection chain:\n\n```\nPOST /do_something HTTP/1.1\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 303 See Other\nLocation: /new_thing_1513\n\nGET /new_thing_1513\nHost: server.example.com\n...\n\nHTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect\nLocation: //failover.example.com/new_thing_1513\n```\n\nThe intermediate 303 See Other has caused the POST to be converted to\na GET.  The subsequent 307 should preserve the GET.  However, because\n`Session.resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the _original_\nrequest object, Requests will issue a POST!\n\n",
    "response": "PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug locations and the problem statement, here are my coordinated repair suggestions:\n\n1. **Location 1 (lines 90-95)**: Modify the request copying logic to handle first vs. subsequent iterations differently. Instead of always copying the original request (`req.copy()`), the code should:\n   - For the first iteration: Copy the original request (`req.copy()`)\n   - For subsequent iterations: Copy the current `prepared_request` to preserve method changes from previous redirects\n   \n   This can be implemented by tracking whether it's the first iteration or using the existing iteration counter `i` to determine the source for copying.\n\n2. **Location 2 (lines 124-126)**: The method conversion logic for 303 redirects is correct and should remain unchanged. This location properly converts POST to GET for 303 See Other responses. However, its effectiveness depends on Location 1 being fixed so that subsequent redirects preserve this method change rather than reverting to the original method.\n\n**Coordination between locations**: \n- Location 2 correctly implements the HTTP specification for method conversion during 303 redirects\n- Location 1's fix ensures that the method changes made by Location 2 are preserved across the entire redirect chain\n- Together, they will properly handle the scenario: POST → 303 See Other (converts to GET) → 307 Temporary Redirect (preserves GET)\n\nThe fix maintains the framework's design patterns while ensuring that redirect chains correctly preserve method changes made by intermediate redirects, particularly the critical POST→GET conversion for 303 See Other responses.",

Project Structure Exploration\n- **Tool Used**: `explore_directory`\n- **Result**: Located the main requests library structure at `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/`\n- **Key Files Identified**: `sessions.py` (contains the buggy method), `test_requests.py` (test suite)\n\n### 2. Bug Location and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `Session.resolve_redirects` method in `sessions.py` (lines 84-185)\n- **Bug Identified**: Line 91 contains `prepared_request = req.copy()` which always copies the **original** request parameter instead of the current modified request\n\n### 3. Technical Analysis of the Bug\n\n**Problem Scenario**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n- **First redirect (303)**: POST correctly gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n- **Second redirect (307)**: Should preserve the GET method, but because line 91 copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly reverts to POST method\n\n**Root Cause**: The `while resp.is_redirect:` loop (line 90) always copies from the original `req` parameter rather than maintaining state from previous iterations.\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located and analyzed the buggy `resolve_redirects` method\n- Identified the exact line causing the issue (line 91)\n- Understood the technical impact on redirect chain handling\n- Mapped out the method's complete flow (lines 84-185)\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Need to examine existing tests to understand expected behavior\n- Need to implement the fix\n\n### ❌ Not Started\n- Creating/running tests to verify the fix\n- Testing the repair implementation\n\n## Key Technical Details\n\n**Bug Location**: `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py`, line 91\n```python\n# BUGGY CODE:\nprepared_request = req.copy()  # Always copies original request\n\n# SHOULD BE:\n# For first iteration: copy original request\n# For subsequent iterations: copy the current prepared_request to maintain state\n```\n\n**Method Context**: \n- Part of `SessionRedirectMixin` class\n- Handles HTTP redirect logic with proper method conversion (POST→GET for 303, etc.)\n- Manages cookies, headers, and authentication during redirects\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement Fix**: Modify line 91 to properly handle request copying in redirect chains\n2. **Test Verification**: Run existing tests and create new ones to verify the fix works for complex redirect scenarios\n3. **Validation**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Project structure navigation\n- `search_code_with_context`: Method location\n- `read_file_lines`: Detailed code analysis\n\nThe investigation has successfully identified the root cause and location of the bug. The fix requires modifying the request copying logic to maintain state across redirect iterations.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I understand the bug clearly. Let me analyze what I've found:\n\n1. **The Bug**: In line 91 of `resolve_redirects`, the code does `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the start of each iteration in the while loop. This means it always copies the **original** request (`req`) instead of the **current** request that may have been modified in previous iterations.\n\n2. **The Problem**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n   - First redirect (303): POST gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n   - Second redirect (307): Should preserve the GET, but because it copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly uses POST method\n\n3. **The Fix**: The code should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration, not the original `req` parameter.\n\nLet me continue reading to see the end of the method and understand the complete flow.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\", \"start_line\": 181, \"end_line\": 200 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\nTotal lines: 571\nShowing lines 181-200:\n\n 181:             extract_cookies_to_jar(self.cookies, prepared_request, resp.raw)\n 182: \n 183:             i += 1\n 184:             yield resp\n 185: \n 186: \n 187: class Session(SessionRedirectMixin):\n 188:     \"\"\"A Requests session.\n 189: \n 190:     Provides cookie persistence, connection-pooling, and configuration.\n 191: \n 192:     Basic Usage::\n 193: \n 194:       >>> import requests\n 195:       >>> s = requests.Session()\n 196:       >>> s.get('http://httpbin.org/get')\n 197:       200\n 198:     \"\"\"\n 199: \n 200:     __attrs__ = [\n\n\nAssistant: Perfect!

have a complete understanding of the bug and the codebase. Let me summarize what I've found:\n\n**The Bug**: In `Session.resolve_redirects` method at line 91, the code does `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the start of each iteration in the while loop. This always copies the **original** request parameter instead of the **current** request that may have been modified in previous iterations.\n\n**The Problem Scenario**: \n1. POST request gets 303 See Other redirect → correctly converts to GET (lines 124-126)\n2. GET request gets 307 Temporary Redirect → should preserve GET method\n3. But because line 91 copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly reverts to POST method\n\n**The Fix Needed**: The code should copy the current `prepared_request` from the previous iteration for subsequent redirects, not always the original `req` parameter.\n\n**Current Status**: I have identified the exact location and nature of the bug. The fix is straightforward - modify line 91 to handle the first iteration differently from subsequent iterations.\n\nNow I have enough information to provide the precise locations where the bug needs to be fixed.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\n## Bug Locations Identified\n\nBased on my analysis of the `Session.resolve_redirects` method in `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py`, I have identified the precise location where the bug needs to be fixed:\n\n**Primary Bug Location:**\n- **Line 91**: `prepared_request = req.copy()` - This line incorrectly copies the original request parameter (`req`) at the start of each iteration in the redirect loop, instead of preserving the modified request from previous iterations.\n\n**Related Context Lines:**\n- **Lines 90-95**: The while loop structure and request preparation logic that needs to be modified to handle first vs. subsequent iterations differently\n- **Lines 124-126**: The method conversion logic for 303 redirects (POST→GET) that works correctly but gets overridden by the bug in line 91\n- **Lines 84-89**: Method signature and initial setup that establishes the original request parameter\n- **Lines 183-185**: End of the loop where the iteration counter is incremented and response is yielded\n\nThe bug manifests when there are multiple redirects in a chain where an intermediate redirect (like 303 See Other) changes the HTTP method, but subsequent redirects (like 307 Temporary Redirect) should preserve that changed method. Instead, the code reverts to the original method because it always copies from the original request parameter.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nUser: If you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\n\nAssistant: PROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the `Session.resolve_redirects` method and the problem description, I have identified the precise locations where the bug occurs and needs to be fixed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 90,\n            \"end_line\": 95\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 124,\n            \"end_line\": 126\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Lines 90-95**: This is the core bug location where the while loop starts each iteration by copying the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()` at line 91). This needs to be modified to copy the current prepared_request for subsequent iterations instead of always copying the original request.\n\n2. **Lines 124-126**: This is the method conversion logic for 303 redirects that correctly converts POST to GET, but its effect gets overridden by the bug in line 91 during subsequent redirects. This location shows the intended behavior that should be preserved across redirect chains.\n\nThe bug manifests exactly as described in the problem statement: when a POST request gets a 303 See Other redirect (correctly converting to GET), followed by a 307 Temporary Redirect (which should preserve the GET method), the code incorrectly reverts to POST because it copies the original request instead of the modified one.\nAssistant: PROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug locations and the problem statement, here are my coordinated repair suggestions:\n\n1. **Location 1 (lines 90-95)**: Modify the request copying logic to handle first vs. subsequent iterations differently. Instead of always copying the original request (`req.copy()`), the code should:\n   - For the first iteration: Copy the original request (`req.copy()`)\n   - For subsequent iterations: Copy the current `prepared_request` to preserve method changes from previous redirects\n   \n   This can be implemented by tracking whether it's the first iteration or using the existing iteration counter `i` to determine the source for copying.\n\n2. **Location 2 (lines 124-126)**: The method conversion logic for 303 redirects is correct and should remain unchanged. This location properly converts POST to GET for 303 See Other responses. However, its effectiveness depends on Location 1 being fixed so that subsequent redirects preserve this method change rather than reverting to the original method.\n\n**Coordination between locations**: \n- Location 2 correctly implements the HTTP specification for method conversion during 303 redirects\n- Location 1's fix ensures that the method changes made by Location 2 are preserved across the entire redirect chain\n- Together, they will properly handle the scenario: POST → 303 See Other (converts to GET) → 307 Temporary Redirect (preserves GET)\n\nThe fix maintains the framework's design patterns while ensuring that redirect chains correctly preserve method changes made by intermediate redirects, particularly the critical POST→GET conversion for 303 See Other responses.\nUser: According to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 90-95\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        while resp.is_redirect:\n            prepared_request = req.copy()\n\n            resp.content  # Consume socket so it can be released\n\n            if i >= self.max_redirects:\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 124-126\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if (resp.status_code == codes.see_other and\n                    method != 'HEAD'):\n                method = 'GET'\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n\n\nPlease create a comprehensive summary that:\n1.

Bug Location and Analysis\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` and `read_file_lines`\n- **Target**: `Session.resolve_redirects` method in `sessions.py` (lines 84-185)\n- **Bug Identified**: Line 91 contains `prepared_request = req.copy()` which always copies the **original** request parameter instead of the current modified request\n\n### 3. Complete Method Analysis\n- **Method Structure**: Located within `SessionRedirectMixin` class (lines 84-185)\n- **Key Components**:\n  - **Lines 90-95**: While loop with buggy request copying logic\n  - **Lines 124-126**: Correct method conversion for 303 redirects (POST→GET)\n  - **Line 91**: The exact bug location - `prepared_request = req.copy()`\n  - **Lines 183-185**: Loop completion with iteration counter and response yielding\n\n### 4. Technical Analysis of the Bug\n\n**Problem Scenario**: In a redirect chain like POST → 303 See Other → 307 Temporary Redirect:\n- **First redirect (303)**: POST correctly gets converted to GET (lines 124-126)\n- **Second redirect (307)**: Should preserve the GET method, but because line 91 copies the original POST request again, it incorrectly reverts to POST method\n\n**Root Cause**: The `while resp.is_redirect:` loop (line 90) always copies from the original `req` parameter rather than maintaining state from previous iterations.\n\n### 5. Test Suite Investigation\n- **Tool Used**: `search_code_with_context` on `test_requests.py`\n- **Findings**: \n  - Found multiple redirect-related tests but no specific tests for complex redirect chains\n  - Located commented-out POST redirect test (line 121-123)\n  - No existing tests for 303→307 redirect chains that would expose this bug\n  - Tests focus on single redirects rather than redirect chains with method changes\n\n### 6.

Instead of always copying the original request (`req.copy()`), the code should:\n   - For the first iteration: Copy the original request (`req.copy()`)\n   - For subsequent iterations: Copy the current `prepared_request` to preserve method changes from previous redirects\n   \n   This can be implemented by tracking whether it's the first iteration or using the existing iteration counter `i` to determine the source for copying.\n\n2. **Location 2 (lines 124-126)**: The method conversion logic for 303 redirects is correct and should remain unchanged.

This needs to be modified to copy the current prepared_request for subsequent iterations instead of always copying the original request.\n\n2. **Lines 124-126**: This is the method conversion logic for 303 redirects that correctly converts POST to GET, but its effect gets overridden by the bug in line 91 during subsequent redirects. This location shows the intended behavior that should be preserved across redirect chains.\n\nThe bug manifests exactly as described in the problem statement: when a POST request gets a 303 See Other redirect (correctly converting to GET), followed by a 307 Temporary Redirect (which should preserve the GET method), the code incorrectly reverts to POST because it copies the original request instead of the modified one.\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug locations and the problem statement, here are my coordinated repair suggestions:\n\n1. **Location 1 (lines 90-95)**: Modify the request copying logic to handle first vs. subsequent iterations differently.

The code segments perfectly match my analysis:\n\n**Location 1** contains the exact bug on line 91: `prepared_request = req.copy()` - this always copies the original request (`req`) instead of preserving method changes from previous redirect iterations.\n\n**Location 2** contains the correct HTTP specification implementation for 303 See Other redirects, converting POST to GET. This logic is correct and should remain unchanged.\n\nThe fix is straightforward: modify Location 1 to copy the current `prepared_request` for subsequent iterations instead of always copying the original `req`, while preserving Location 2's correct method conversion logic.

However, its effectiveness depends on Location 1 being fixed so that subsequent redirects preserve this method change rather than reverting to the original method.\n\n**Coordination between locations**: \n- Location 2 correctly implements the HTTP specification for method conversion during 303 redirects\n- Location 1's fix ensures that the method changes made by Location 2 are preserved across the entire redirect chain\n- Together, they will properly handle the scenario: POST → 303 See Other (converts to GET) → 307 Temporary Redirect (preserves GET)\n\nThe fix maintains the framework's design patterns while ensuring that redirect chains correctly preserve method changes made by intermediate redirects, particularly the critical POST→GET conversion for 303 See Other responses.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 90-95\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        while resp.is_redirect:\n            prepared_request = req.copy()\n\n            resp.content  # Consume socket so it can be released\n\n            if i >= self.max_redirects:\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 124-126\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            if (resp.status_code == codes.see_other and\n                    method != 'HEAD'):\n                method = 'GET'\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n#REFLECT\nLooking at the provided code segments and comparing them to my earlier suggestions, I can see:\n\nLocation 1 (lines 90-95) shows the exact bug I identified - line 91 contains `prepared_request = req.copy()` which always copies the original request instead of preserving method changes from previous iterations.\n\nLocation 2 (lines 124-126) shows the correct method conversion logic for 303 redirects that converts POST to GET.\n\nThese locations match exactly what I analyzed and the fix strategy is clear: modify Location 1 to copy the current prepared_request for subsequent iterations instead of always copying the original request, while keeping Location 2 unchanged as it implements the correct HTTP specification behavior.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, these locations are ready for fixing. The code segments perfectly match my analysis:\n\n**Location 1** contains the exact bug on line 91: `prepared_request = req.copy()` - this always copies the original request (`req`) instead of preserving method changes from previous redirect iterations.\n\n**Location 2** contains the correct HTTP specification implementation for 303 See Other redirects, converting POST to GET. This logic is correct and should remain unchanged.\n\nThe fix is straightforward: modify Location 1 to copy the current `prepared_request` for subsequent iterations instead of always copying the original `req`, while preserving Location 2's correct method conversion logic. This will ensure that method changes (like POST→GET from 303 redirects) are maintained throughout the entire redirect chain.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/sessions.py lines 90-95\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import os\n  from collections import Mapping\n  from datetime import datetime\n  from .compat import cookielib, OrderedDict, urljoin, urlparse, builtin_str\n  from .cookies import (\n  from .models import Request, PreparedRequest, DEFAULT_REDIRECT_LIMIT\n  from .hooks import default_hooks, dispatch_hook\n  from .utils import to_key_val_list, default_headers, to_native_string\n  from .exceptions import TooManyRedirects, InvalidSchema\n  from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\n  from .adapters import HTTPAdapter\n  from .utils import requote_uri, get_environ_proxies, get_netrc_auth\n  from .status_codes import codes\n  from .models import REDIRECT_STATI\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   80:     return merge_setting(request_hooks, session_hooks, dict_class)\n[C]   81: \n[C]   82: \n[C]   83: class SessionRedirectMixin(object):\n[C]   84:     def resolve_redirects(self, resp, req, stream=False, timeout=None,\n[C]   85:                           verify=True, cert=None, proxies=None):\n[C]   86:         \"\"\"Receives a Response.
