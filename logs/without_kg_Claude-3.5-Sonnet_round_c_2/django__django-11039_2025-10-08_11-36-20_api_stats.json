    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Bug Fix Summary: sqlmigrate Transaction Wrapping Issue\n\n## Main Objective\nFix a bug in Django's `sqlmigrate` management command where it incorrectly wraps SQL output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements even when the database doesn't support transactional DDL operations.\n\n## Problem Description\n- **Current Issue**: `sqlmigrate` only checks `migration.atomic` to determine if it should wrap output in transaction statements\n- **Expected Behavior**: Should check BOTH `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` (like the migration executor does)\n- **Impact**: Generates incorrect SQL for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- Located Django project at `/root/hy/projects_2/django/`\n- Found the target file: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n\n### 2. Bug Identification\n**Current problematic code (line 59):**\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n```\n\n**Analysis of the file structure:**\n- File has 65 total lines\n- The bug is in the `handle()` method\n- Line 11 sets `output_transaction = True` as default\n- Line 59 overrides this based only on `migration.atomic`\n\n### 3. Code Analysis Results\n**Key findings from `sqlmigrate.py`:**\n- Command class inherits from `BaseCommand`\n- Uses `MigrationExecutor` to load migration data\n- Has access to `connection` object (line 34)\n- Currently ignores `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located and analyzed the buggy file\n- Identified the exact line causing the issue (line 59)\n- Understood the current logic flow\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Need to examine migration executor implementation to understand correct pattern\n- Need to locate and examine test files mentioned in problem description\n\n### ❌ Pending\n- Search for `can_rollback_ddl` usage patterns failed in migrations directory\n- Need to find the correct implementation pattern from migration executor\n- Need to implement the fix\n- Need to add/modify tests in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### File Structure\n```\n/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\n├── Lines 1-31: Imports and class setup\n├── Lines 32-56: Migration resolution logic  \n├── Line 59: 🐛 BUG LOCATION - only checks migration.atomic\n└── Lines 61-65: SQL generation and output\n```\n\n### Required Fix Pattern\nThe fix should change line 59 from:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n```\nTo something like:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n```\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Find correct implementation pattern**: Search for how migration executor properly handles both conditions\n2. **Locate test files**: Find `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to understand existing test structure\n3. **Implement fix**: Modify line 59 to include `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` check\n4. **Add tests**: Create test cases for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n5. **Verify fix**: Ensure the change works correctly for both supporting and non-supporting databases\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Successfully navigated Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Analyzed the complete `sqlmigrate.py` file\n- `search_code_with_context`: Failed to find `can_rollback_ddl` usage patterns (need alternative search strategy)\n\nThe bug location is clearly identified and the fix approach is understood, but implementation requires finding the correct pattern from the migration executor code.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me see the rest of the `sqlmigrate.py` file to understand the complete implementation:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\", \"start_line\": 51, \"end_line\": 65 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\nTotal lines: 65\nShowing lines 51-65:\n\n  51:             raise CommandError(\"More than one migration matches '%s' in app '%s'.

Looking at the `sqlmigrate.py` file:\n\n1. **Current problematic code (line 59)**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n   - This only checks if the migration is atomic\n   - It ignores whether the database supports transactional DDL\n\n2. **The bug**: According to the problem description, the migration executor correctly checks BOTH `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`, but `sqlmigrate` only checks `migration.atomic`.\n\n3. **The fix needed**: Change line 59 to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\nNow I need to:\n1.

Identify the exact locations that need to be modified\n\nLet me first examine the migration executor to see how it correctly handles this logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"can_rollback_ddl\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'can_rollback_ddl' in directory '/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations'\nLet me search more broadly for `can_rollback_ddl` in the entire Django codebase to understand how it's used:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"can_rollback_ddl\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'can_rollback_ddl' in directory (showing first 13 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/createcachetable.py\nLines 93-99:\n  93:                 self.stdout.write(statement)\n  94:             return\n  95: \n  96:         with transaction.atomic(using=database, savepoint=connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):\n  97:             with connection.cursor() as curs:\n  98:                 try:\n  99:                     curs.execute(full_statement)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/features.py\nLines 164-170:\n 164:     atomic_transactions = True\n 165: \n 166:     #

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Bug Fix Summary: sqlmigrate Transaction Wrapping Issue\n\n## Main Objective\nFix a bug in Django's `sqlmigrate` management command where it incorrectly wraps SQL output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements even when the database doesn't support transactional DDL operations.\n\n## Problem Description\n- **Current Issue**: `sqlmigrate` only checks `migration.atomic` to determine if it should wrap output in transaction statements\n- **Expected Behavior**: Should check BOTH `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` (like the migration executor does)\n- **Impact**: Generates incorrect SQL for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- Located Django project at `/root/hy/projects_2/django/`\n- Found the target file: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n\n### 2. Bug Identification\n**Current problematic code (line 59):**\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n```\n\n**Analysis of the file structure:**\n- File has 65 total lines\n- The bug is in the `handle()` method\n- Line 11 sets `output_transaction = True` as default\n- Line 59 overrides this based only on `migration.atomic`\n\n### 3. Code Analysis Results\n**Key findings from `sqlmigrate.py`:**\n- Command class inherits from `BaseCommand`\n- Uses `MigrationExecutor` to load migration data\n- Has access to `connection` object (line 34)\n- Currently ignores `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located and analyzed the buggy file\n- Identified the exact line causing the issue (line 59)\n- Understood the current logic flow\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Need to examine migration executor implementation to understand correct pattern\n- Need to locate and examine test files mentioned in problem description\n\n### ❌ Pending\n- Search for `can_rollback_ddl` usage patterns failed in migrations directory\n- Need to find the correct implementation pattern from migration executor\n- Need to implement the fix\n- Need to add/modify tests in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### File Structure\n```\n/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\n├── Lines 1-31: Imports and class setup\n├── Lines 32-56: Migration resolution logic  \n├── Line 59: 🐛 BUG LOCATION - only checks migration.atomic\n└── Lines 61-65: SQL generation and output\n```\n\n### Required Fix Pattern\nThe fix should change line 59 from:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n```\nTo something like:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n```\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Find correct implementation pattern**: Search for how migration executor properly handles both conditions\n2. **Locate test files**: Find `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to understand existing test structure\n3. **Implement fix**: Modify line 59 to include `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` check\n4. **Add tests**: Create test cases for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n5. **Verify fix**: Ensure the change works correctly for both supporting and non-supporting databases\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Successfully navigated Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Analyzed the complete `sqlmigrate.py` file\n- `search_code_with_context`: Failed to find `can_rollback_ddl` usage patterns (need alternative search strategy)\n\nThe bug location is clearly identified and the fix approach is understood, but implementation requires finding the correct pattern from the migration executor code.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow let me see the rest of the `sqlmigrate.py` file to understand the complete implementation:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\", \"start_line\": 51, \"end_line\": 65 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\nTotal lines: 65\nShowing lines 51-65:\n\n  51:             raise CommandError(\"More than one migration matches '%s' in app '%s'.

Is it in INSTALLED_APPS?\" % (\n  55:                 migration_name, app_label))\n  56:         targets = [(app_label, migration.name)]\n  57: \n  58:         # Show begin/end around output only for atomic migrations\n  59:         self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n  60: \n  61:         # Make a plan that represents just the requested migrations and show SQL\n  62:         # for it\n  63:         plan = [(executor.loader.graph.nodes[targets[0]], options['backwards'])]\n  64:         sql_statements = executor.collect_sql(plan)\n  65:         return '\\n'.join(sql_statements)\n\n#REFLECT\nNow I can see the bug clearly! Looking at the `sqlmigrate.py` file:\n\n1. **Current problematic code (line 59)**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n   - This only checks if the migration is atomic\n   - It ignores whether the database supports transactional DDL\n\n2. **The bug**: According to the problem description, the migration executor correctly checks BOTH `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`, but `sqlmigrate` only checks `migration.atomic`.\n\n3. **The fix needed**: Change line 59 to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\nNow I need to:\n1. Look at how the migration executor handles this correctly to understand the pattern\n2. Check the test file mentioned in the problem description\n3. Identify the exact locations that need to be modified\n\nLet me first examine the migration executor to see how it correctly handles this logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"can_rollback_ddl\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'can_rollback_ddl' in directory '/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations'\nLet me search more broadly for `can_rollback_ddl` in the entire Django codebase to understand how it's used:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"can_rollback_ddl\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'can_rollback_ddl' in directory (showing first 13 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/createcachetable.py\nLines 93-99:\n  93:                 self.stdout.write(statement)\n  94:             return\n  95: \n  96:         with transaction.atomic(using=database, savepoint=connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):\n  97:             with connection.cursor() as curs:\n  98:                 try:\n  99:                     curs.execute(full_statement)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/features.py\nLines 164-170:\n 164:     atomic_transactions = True\n 165: \n 166:     #

    "prompt": "Previous conversation summary: # Django Bug Fix Summary: sqlmigrate Transaction Wrapping Issue\n\n## Main Objective\nFix a bug in Django's `sqlmigrate` management command where it incorrectly wraps SQL output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements even when the database doesn't support transactional DDL operations.\n\n## Problem Description\n- **Current Issue**: `sqlmigrate` only checks `migration.atomic` to determine if it should wrap output in transaction statements\n- **Expected Behavior**: Should check BOTH `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` (like the migration executor does)\n- **Impact**: Generates incorrect SQL for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- Located Django project at `/root/hy/projects_2/django/`\n- Found the target file: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n\n### 2. Bug Identification\n**Current problematic code (line 59):**\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n```\n\n**Analysis of the file structure:**\n- File has 65 total lines\n- The bug is in the `handle()` method\n- Line 11 sets `output_transaction = True` as default\n- Line 59 overrides this based only on `migration.atomic`\n\n### 3. Code Analysis Results\n**Key findings from `sqlmigrate.py`:**\n- Command class inherits from `BaseCommand`\n- Uses `MigrationExecutor` to load migration data\n- Has access to `connection` object (line 34)\n- Currently ignores `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located and analyzed the buggy file\n- Identified the exact line causing the issue (line 59)\n- Understood the current logic flow\n\n### 🔄 In Progress\n- Need to examine migration executor implementation to understand correct pattern\n- Need to locate and examine test files mentioned in problem description\n\n### ❌ Pending\n- Search for `can_rollback_ddl` usage patterns failed in migrations directory\n- Need to find the correct implementation pattern from migration executor\n- Need to implement the fix\n- Need to add/modify tests in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### File Structure\n```\n/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\n├── Lines 1-31: Imports and class setup\n├── Lines 32-56: Migration resolution logic  \n├── Line 59: 🐛 BUG LOCATION - only checks migration.atomic\n└── Lines 61-65: SQL generation and output\n```\n\n### Required Fix Pattern\nThe fix should change line 59 from:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n```\nTo something like:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n```\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Find correct implementation pattern**: Search for how migration executor properly handles both conditions\n2. **Locate test files**: Find `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to understand existing test structure\n3. **Implement fix**: Modify line 59 to include `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` check\n4. **Add tests**: Create test cases for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n5. **Verify fix**: Ensure the change works correctly for both supporting and non-supporting databases\n\n## Tools Used\n- `explore_directory`: Successfully navigated Django project structure\n- `read_file_lines`: Analyzed the complete `sqlmigrate.py` file\n- `search_code_with_context`: Failed to find `can_rollback_ddl` usage patterns (need alternative search strategy)\n\nThe bug location is clearly identified and the fix approach is understood, but implementation requires finding the correct pattern from the migration executor code.\n\nRecent conversation messages:\nUser: Try to find and repair the bug in the project.\n\nAssistant: Now let me see the rest of the `sqlmigrate.py` file to understand the complete implementation:\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\", \"start_line\": 51, \"end_line\": 65 }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\nTotal lines: 65\nShowing lines 51-65:\n\n  51:             raise CommandError(\"More than one migration matches '%s' in app '%s'. Please be more specific.\" % (\n  52:                 migration_name, app_label))\n  53:         except KeyError:\n  54:             raise CommandError(\"Cannot find a migration matching '%s' from app '%s'. Is it in INSTALLED_APPS?\" % (\n  55:                 migration_name, app_label))\n  56:         targets = [(app_label, migration.name)]\n  57: \n  58:         # Show begin/end around output only for atomic migrations\n  59:         self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n  60: \n  61:         # Make a plan that represents just the requested migrations and show SQL\n  62:         # for it\n  63:         plan = [(executor.loader.graph.nodes[targets[0]], options['backwards'])]\n  64:         sql_statements = executor.collect_sql(plan)\n  65:         return '\\n'.join(sql_statements)\n\n\nAssistant: #REFLECT\nNow I can see the bug clearly! Looking at the `sqlmigrate.py` file:\n\n1. **Current problematic code (line 59)**: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n   - This only checks if the migration is atomic\n   - It ignores whether the database supports transactional DDL\n\n2. **The bug**: According to the problem description, the migration executor correctly checks BOTH `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`, but `sqlmigrate` only checks `migration.atomic`.\n\n3. **The fix needed**: Change line 59 to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\nNow I need to:\n1. Look at how the migration executor handles this correctly to understand the pattern\n2. Check the test file mentioned in the problem description\n3. Identify the exact locations that need to be modified\n\nLet me first examine the migration executor to see how it correctly handles this logic.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"can_rollback_ddl\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nNo matches found for 'can_rollback_ddl' in directory '/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/migrations'\n\nAssistant: Let me search more broadly for `can_rollback_ddl` in the entire Django codebase to understand how it's used:\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"can_rollback_ddl\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django\" }\nUser: /\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'can_rollback_ddl' in directory (showing first 13 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/createcachetable.py\nLines 93-99:\n  93:                 self.stdout.write(statement)\n  94:             return\n  95: \n  96:         with transaction.atomic(using=database, savepoint=connection.features.can_rollback_ddl):\n  97:             with connection.cursor() as curs:\n  98:                 try:\n  99:                     curs.execute(full_statement)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/features.py\nLines 164-170:\n 164:     atomic_transactions = True\n 165: \n 166:     #

    "response": "# Django Bug Fix Summary: sqlmigrate Transaction Wrapping Issue\n\n## Main Objective\nFix a bug in Django's `sqlmigrate` management command where it incorrectly wraps SQL output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements even when the database doesn't support transactional DDL operations.\n\n## Problem Description\n- **Current Issue**: `sqlmigrate` only checks `migration.atomic` to determine if it should wrap output in transaction statements\n- **Expected Behavior**: Should check BOTH `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` (like the migration executor does)\n- **Impact**: Generates incorrect SQL for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- Located Django project at `/root/hy/projects_2/django/`\n- Found the target file: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n\n### 2. Bug Identification & Analysis\n**Current problematic code (line 59):**\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n```\n\n**Complete file analysis:**\n- File has 65 total lines\n- The bug is in the `handle()` method\n- Line 11 sets `output_transaction = True` as default\n- Line 59 overrides this based only on `migration.atomic`\n- Has access to `connection` object (line 34) but doesn't use `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n### 3. Pattern Discovery & Solution Identification\n**✅ Found the correct implementation pattern:**\nFrom `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py` line 97:\n```python\nself.atomic_migration = self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic\n```\n\n**✅ Database feature analysis:**\n- PostgreSQL: `can_rollback_ddl = True` (supports transactional DDL)\n- SQLite: `can_rollback_ddl = True` (supports transactional DDL)  \n- Base features: `can_rollback_ddl = False` (default, many databases don't support it)\n\n### 4. Test Pattern Analysis\n**✅ Located and analyzed test file:** `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n\n**Key test patterns identified:**\n- `test_sqlmigrate_forwards()` (lines 523-560): Tests that transaction wrappers ARE included for atomic migrations\n- `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration()` (lines 606-618): Tests that transaction wrappers are NOT included for non-atomic migrations\n- Tests use `connection.ops.start_transaction_sql()` and `connection.ops.end_transaction_sql()` to verify presence/absence of transaction statements\n\n**Test structure pattern:**\n```python\nout = io.StringIO()\ncall_command(\"sqlmigrate\", \"migrations\", \"0001\", stdout=out)\noutput = out.getvalue().lower()\n# Check for presence/absence of transaction SQL\n```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located and analyzed the buggy file (`sqlmigrate.py`)\n- Identified the exact line causing the issue (line 59)\n- Found the correct implementation pattern from `schema.py`\n- Analyzed existing test patterns in `test_commands.py`\n- Understood database feature definitions for `can_rollback_ddl`\n\n### 🔄 Ready for Implementation\n**The exact fix needed:**\nChange line 59 from:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n```\nTo:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n```\n\n### ❌ Pending Tasks\n1. **Implement the fix**: Modify line 59 in `sqlmigrate.py`\n2. **Add comprehensive tests**: Create test cases for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n3. **Verify fix**: Ensure the change works correctly for both supporting and non-supporting databases\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### File Structure\n```\n/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\n├── Lines 1-31: Imports and class setup\n├── Lines 32-56: Migration resolution logic  \n├── Line 59: 🐛 BUG LOCATION - only checks migration.atomic\n└── Lines 61-65: SQL generation and output\n```\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n1. **Simple one-line fix**: Add `and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to line 59\n2. **Test approach**: Create a test that mocks `can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies no transaction wrappers are output\n3. **Verification**: Ensure existing tests still pass (atomic migrations with DDL support still get transaction wrappers)\n\n### Key Code References\n- **Bug location**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py:59`\n- **Correct pattern**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py:97`\n- **Test file**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n- **Feature definitions**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/features.py:167`\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement fix**: Modify line 59 to include `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` check\n2. **Add test case**: Create test for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n3. **Run tests**: Verify both new and existing tests pass\n4. **Final verification**: Test the fix with actual database backends\n\nThe bug is fully understood, the solution is identified, and all necessary context has been gathered.

`/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` at line 59\n- Current code: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic` \n- This only checks if the migration is atomic, but ignores whether the database supports transactional DDL\n- Should also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` like the migration executor does\n\n**Solution Pattern:**\n- From schema.py line 97: `self.atomic_migration = self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic`\n- Need to change line 59 to: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n**Test Patterns:**\n- Existing tests check for presence/absence of transaction SQL using `connection.ops.start_transaction_sql()` and `connection.ops.end_transaction_sql()`\n- Need to add a test that mocks `can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies no transaction wrappers are output\n\nI have sufficient information to identify the exact locations that need to be fixed.

Test Pattern Analysis\n**✅ Located and analyzed test file:** `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n\n**Key test patterns identified:**\n- `test_sqlmigrate_forwards()` (lines 523-560): Tests that transaction wrappers ARE included for atomic migrations\n- `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration()` (lines 606-618): Tests that transaction wrappers are NOT included for non-atomic migrations\n- Tests use `connection.ops.start_transaction_sql()` and `connection.ops.end_transaction_sql()` to verify presence/absence of transaction statements\n\n**Test structure pattern:**\n```python\nout = io.StringIO()\ncall_command(\"sqlmigrate\", \"migrations\", \"0001\", stdout=out)\noutput = out.getvalue().lower()\n# Check for presence/absence of transaction SQL\n```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located and analyzed the buggy file (`sqlmigrate.py`)\n- Identified the exact line causing the issue (line 59)\n- Found the correct implementation pattern from `schema.py`\n- Analyzed existing test patterns in `test_commands.py`\n- Understood database feature definitions for `can_rollback_ddl`\n\n### 🔄 Ready for Implementation\n**The exact fix needed:**\nChange line 59 from:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n```\nTo:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n```\n\n### ❌ Pending Tasks\n1. **Implement the fix**: Modify line 59 in `sqlmigrate.py`\n2. **Add comprehensive tests**: Create test cases for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n3. **Verify fix**: Ensure the change works correctly for both supporting and non-supporting databases\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### File Structure\n```\n/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\n├── Lines 1-31: Imports and class setup\n├── Lines 32-56: Migration resolution logic  \n├── Line 59: 🐛 BUG LOCATION - only checks migration.atomic\n└── Lines 61-65: SQL generation and output\n```\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n1. **Simple one-line fix**: Add `and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to line 59\n2. **Test approach**: Create a test that mocks `can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies no transaction wrappers are output\n3. **Verification**: Ensure existing tests still pass (atomic migrations with DDL support still get transaction wrappers)\n\n### Key Code References\n- **Bug location**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py:59`\n- **Correct pattern**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py:97`\n- **Test file**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n- **Feature definitions**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/features.py:167`\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement fix**: Modify line 59 to include `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` check\n2. **Add test case**: Create test for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n3. **Run tests**: Verify both new and existing tests pass\n4. **Final verification**: Test the fix with actual database backends\n\nThe bug is fully understood, the solution is identified, and all necessary context has been gathered.

the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py\nStart line: 618\nEnd line: 618\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the codebase, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for the two interconnected bug locations:\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py:59]**: Change the transaction output logic to match the migration executor's behavior by modifying:\n   ```python\n   # Current buggy code:\n   self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n   \n   # Fixed code:\n   self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n   ```\n   This ensures sqlmigrate uses the same dual condition check as the migration executor, preventing incorrect transaction wrappers for databases that don't support transactional DDL.\n\n2. **[/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py:618]**: Add a new test method after the existing `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration()` to verify the fix works correctly:\n   ```python\n   def test_sqlmigrate_for_non_ddl_rollback_database(self):\n       \"\"\"\n       Transaction wrappers aren't shown for databases that don't support DDL rollback.\n       \"\"\"\n       with mock.patch.object(connection.features, 'can_rollback_ddl', False):\n           out = io.StringIO()\n           call_command(\"sqlmigrate\", \"migrations\", \"0001\", stdout=out)\n           output = out.getvalue().lower()\n           queries = [q.strip() for q in output.splitlines()]\n           if connection.ops.start_transaction_sql():\n               self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.start_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)\n           self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.end_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)\n   ```\n   This test mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies that no transaction SQL is output, complementing the existing test pattern while validating the fix from location 1.\n\nThese suggestions work in coordination: the code fix (1) implements the correct logic, while the test (2) ensures this logic works properly for databases that don't support transactional DDL, following the exact pattern described in the problem statement.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nLet me

\n\n#REFLECT\nBased on the conversation summary and the test patterns I've examined, I now have a complete understanding of the bug and the solution needed:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n- The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` at line 59\n- Current code: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic` \n- This only checks if the migration is atomic, but ignores whether the database supports transactional DDL\n- Should also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` like the migration executor does\n\n**Solution Pattern:**\n- From schema.py line 97: `self.atomic_migration = self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic`\n- Need to change line 59 to: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n**Test Patterns:**\n- Existing tests check for presence/absence of transaction SQL using `connection.ops.start_transaction_sql()` and `connection.ops.end_transaction_sql()`\n- Need to add a test that mocks `can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies no transaction wrappers are output\n\nI have sufficient information to identify the exact locations that need to be fixed. Let me provide the precise line ranges.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django sqlmigrate bug, I can identify the precise locations that need to be fixed:\n\n## Bug Locations\n\n**Primary Bug Location:**\n- **File:** `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Lines:** 59-59 (single line fix)\n- **Issue:** Only checks `migration.atomic` but ignores `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n- **Current code:** `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n- **Required fix:** `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n**Test Enhancement Location:**\n- **File:** `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`  \n- **Lines:** 618-618 (add new test method after existing non-atomic test)\n- **Issue:** Missing test case for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n- **Required addition:** New test method that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies no transaction wrappers are output\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe bug occurs because `sqlmigrate` uses a different logic than the migration executor:\n- **Migration executor** (correct): Checks both `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n- **sqlmigrate command** (buggy): Only checks `migration.atomic`\n\nThis causes sqlmigrate to incorrectly wrap SQL output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements for databases that don't support transactional DDL operations, even when the actual migration executor wouldn't use transactions.\n\nThe fix aligns sqlmigrate's behavior with the migration executor by applying the same dual condition check found in `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at line 97.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django sqlmigrate bug, here are the precise locations that need to be addressed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 59,\n            \"end_line\": 59\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 618,\n            \"end_line\": 618\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Location 1** contains the primary bug where `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic` needs to be changed to `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to match the migration executor's logic.\n\n**Location 2** is where a new test method should be added to verify the fix works correctly for databases that don't support transactional DDL by mocking `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl = False`.\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the codebase, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for the two interconnected bug locations:\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py:59]**: Change the transaction output logic to match the migration executor's behavior by modifying:\n   ```python\n   #

Change the transaction output logic to match the migration executor's behavior by modifying:\n   ```python\n   # Current buggy code:\n   self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n   \n   # Fixed code:\n   self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n   ```\n   This ensures sqlmigrate uses the same dual condition check as the migration executor, preventing incorrect transaction wrappers for databases that don't support transactional DDL.\n\n2. **[/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py:618]**: Add a new test method after the existing `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration()` to verify the fix works correctly:\n   ```python\n   def test_sqlmigrate_for_non_ddl_rollback_database(self):\n       \"\"\"\n       Transaction wrappers aren't shown for databases that don't support DDL rollback.\n       \"\"\"\n       with mock.patch.object(connection.features, 'can_rollback_ddl', False):\n           out = io.StringIO()\n           call_command(\"sqlmigrate\", \"migrations\", \"0001\", stdout=out)\n           output = out.getvalue().lower()\n           queries = [q.strip() for q in output.splitlines()]\n           if connection.ops.start_transaction_sql():\n               self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.start_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)\n           self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.end_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)\n   ```\n   This test mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies that no transaction SQL is output, complementing the existing test pattern while validating the fix from location 1.\n\nThese suggestions work in coordination: the code fix (1) implements the correct logic, while the test (2) ensures this logic works properly for databases that don't support transactional DDL, following the exact pattern described in the problem statement.\nNote that the Patch provided should be a direct substitution of the location code by the Locator.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nLet me examine the specific test for non-atomic migrations to understand the pattern:\n\n#TOOL_CALL

\n\n#REFLECT\nBased on the conversation summary and the test patterns I've examined, I now have a complete understanding of the bug and the solution needed:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n- The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` at line 59\n- Current code: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic` \n- This only checks if the migration is atomic, but ignores whether the database supports transactional DDL\n- Should also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` like the migration executor does\n\n**Solution Pattern:**\n- From schema.py line 97: `self.atomic_migration = self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic`\n- Need to change line 59 to: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n**Test Patterns:**\n- Existing tests check for presence/absence of transaction SQL using `connection.ops.start_transaction_sql()` and `connection.ops.end_transaction_sql()`\n- Need to add a test that mocks `can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies no transaction wrappers are output\n\nI have sufficient information to identify the exact locations that need to be fixed. Let me provide the precise line ranges.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django sqlmigrate bug, I can identify the precise locations that need to be fixed:\n\n## Bug Locations\n\n**Primary Bug Location:**\n- **File:** `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Lines:** 59-59 (single line fix)\n- **Issue:** Only checks `migration.atomic` but ignores `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n- **Current code:** `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n- **Required fix:** `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n**Test Enhancement Location:**\n- **File:** `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`  \n- **Lines:** 618-618 (add new test method after existing non-atomic test)\n- **Issue:** Missing test case for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n- **Required addition:** New test method that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies no transaction wrappers are output\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe bug occurs because `sqlmigrate` uses a different logic than the migration executor:\n- **Migration executor** (correct): Checks both `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n- **sqlmigrate command** (buggy): Only checks `migration.atomic`\n\nThis causes sqlmigrate to incorrectly wrap SQL output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements for databases that don't support transactional DDL operations, even when the actual migration executor wouldn't use transactions.\n\nThe fix aligns sqlmigrate's behavior with the migration executor by applying the same dual condition check found in `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at line 97.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django sqlmigrate bug, here are the precise locations that need to be addressed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 59,\n            \"end_line\": 59\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 618,\n            \"end_line\": 618\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Location 1** contains the primary bug where `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic` needs to be changed to `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to match the migration executor's logic.\n\n**Location 2** is where a new test method should be added to verify the fix works correctly for databases that don't support transactional DDL by mocking `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl = False`.\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the codebase, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for the two interconnected bug locations:\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py:59]**: Change the transaction output logic to match the migration executor's behavior by modifying:\n   ```python\n   #

Change sqlmigrate assignment of `self.output_transaction` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` as well\n2. Add a test that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to False\n\nBoth locations are precisely identified and match the suggestions provided. The fix is straightforward and well-defined.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, these locations are ready for fixing. \n\n**Location 1** contains the exact buggy line that needs to be modified from `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic` to `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n\n**Location 2** is the correct insertion point (after the existing non-atomic migration test) where the new test method should be added to verify the fix works for databases that don't support transactional DDL.\n\nThe problem statement clearly confirms these are the right locations and the suggested fixes align perfectly with the requirements. Both the code fix and the test addition are well-defined and ready for implementation.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py lines 59-59\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  from django.apps import apps\n  from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError\n  from django.db import DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS, connections\n  from django.db.migrations.executor import MigrationExecutor\n  from django.db.migrations.loader import AmbiguityError\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]   49:             migration = executor.loader.get_migration_by_prefix(app_label, migration_name)\n[C]   50:         except AmbiguityError:\n[C]   51:             raise CommandError(\"More than one migration matches '%s' in app '%s'.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: # Django Bug Fix Summary: sqlmigrate Transaction Wrapping Issue\n\n## Main Objective\nFix a bug in Django's `sqlmigrate` management command where it incorrectly wraps SQL output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements even when the database doesn't support transactional DDL operations.\n\n## Problem Description\n- **Current Issue**: `sqlmigrate` only checks `migration.atomic` to determine if it should wrap output in transaction statements\n- **Expected Behavior**: Should check BOTH `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` (like the migration executor does)\n- **Impact**: Generates incorrect SQL for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n\n## Key Actions Taken\n\n### 1. Project Structure Exploration\n- Located Django project at `/root/hy/projects_2/django/`\n- Found the target file: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n\n### 2. Bug Identification & Analysis\n**Current problematic code (line 59):**\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n```\n\n**Complete file analysis:**\n- File has 65 total lines\n- The bug is in the `handle()` method\n- Line 11 sets `output_transaction = True` as default\n- Line 59 overrides this based only on `migration.atomic`\n- Has access to `connection` object (line 34) but doesn't use `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n### 3. Pattern Discovery & Solution Identification\n**✅ Found the correct implementation pattern:**\nFrom `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py` line 97:\n```python\nself.atomic_migration = self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic\n```\n\n**✅ Database feature analysis:**\n- PostgreSQL: `can_rollback_ddl = True` (supports transactional DDL)\n- SQLite: `can_rollback_ddl = True` (supports transactional DDL)  \n- Base features: `can_rollback_ddl = False` (default, many databases don't support it)\n\n### 4. Test Pattern Analysis\n**✅ Located and analyzed test file:** `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n\n**Key test patterns identified:**\n- `test_sqlmigrate_forwards()` (lines 523-560): Tests that transaction wrappers ARE included for atomic migrations\n- `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration()` (lines 606-618): Tests that transaction wrappers are NOT included for non-atomic migrations\n- Tests use `connection.ops.start_transaction_sql()` and `connection.ops.end_transaction_sql()` to verify presence/absence of transaction statements\n\n**Test structure pattern:**\n```python\nout = io.StringIO()\ncall_command(\"sqlmigrate\", \"migrations\", \"0001\", stdout=out)\noutput = out.getvalue().lower()\n# Check for presence/absence of transaction SQL\n```\n\n## Current Progress Status\n\n### ✅ Completed\n- Located and analyzed the buggy file (`sqlmigrate.py`)\n- Identified the exact line causing the issue (line 59)\n- Found the correct implementation pattern from `schema.py`\n- Analyzed existing test patterns in `test_commands.py`\n- Understood database feature definitions for `can_rollback_ddl`\n\n### 🔄 Ready for Implementation\n**The exact fix needed:**\nChange line 59 from:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n```\nTo:\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n```\n\n### ❌ Pending Tasks\n1. **Implement the fix**: Modify line 59 in `sqlmigrate.py`\n2. **Add comprehensive tests**: Create test cases for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n3. **Verify fix**: Ensure the change works correctly for both supporting and non-supporting databases\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### File Structure\n```\n/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\n├── Lines 1-31: Imports and class setup\n├── Lines 32-56: Migration resolution logic  \n├── Line 59: 🐛 BUG LOCATION - only checks migration.atomic\n└── Lines 61-65: SQL generation and output\n```\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n1. **Simple one-line fix**: Add `and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to line 59\n2. **Test approach**: Create a test that mocks `can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies no transaction wrappers are output\n3. **Verification**: Ensure existing tests still pass (atomic migrations with DDL support still get transaction wrappers)\n\n### Key Code References\n- **Bug location**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py:59`\n- **Correct pattern**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py:97`\n- **Test file**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`\n- **Feature definitions**: `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/features.py:167`\n\n## Next Steps Required\n1. **Implement fix**: Modify line 59 to include `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` check\n2. **Add test case**: Create test for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n3. **Run tests**: Verify both new and existing tests pass\n4. **Final verification**: Test the fix with actual database backends\n\nThe bug is fully understood, the solution is identified, and all necessary context has been gathered. Ready for implementation.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\nStart line: 59\nEnd line: 59\n\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py\nStart line: 618\nEnd line: 618\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the codebase, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for the two interconnected bug locations:\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py:59]**: Change the transaction output logic to match the migration executor's behavior by modifying:\n   ```python\n   # Current buggy code:\n   self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n   \n   # Fixed code:\n   self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n   ```\n   This ensures sqlmigrate uses the same dual condition check as the migration executor, preventing incorrect transaction wrappers for databases that don't support transactional DDL.\n\n2. **[/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py:618]**: Add a new test method after the existing `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration()` to verify the fix works correctly:\n   ```python\n   def test_sqlmigrate_for_non_ddl_rollback_database(self):\n       \"\"\"\n       Transaction wrappers aren't shown for databases that don't support DDL rollback.\n       \"\"\"\n       with mock.patch.object(connection.features, 'can_rollback_ddl', False):\n           out = io.StringIO()\n           call_command(\"sqlmigrate\", \"migrations\", \"0001\", stdout=out)\n           output = out.getvalue().lower()\n           queries = [q.strip() for q in output.splitlines()]\n           if connection.ops.start_transaction_sql():\n               self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.start_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)\n           self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.end_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)\n   ```\n   This test mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies that no transaction SQL is output, complementing the existing test pattern while validating the fix from location 1.\n\nThese suggestions work in coordination: the code fix (1) implements the correct logic, while the test (2) ensures this logic works properly for databases that don't support transactional DDL, following the exact pattern described in the problem statement.\nNote that the Patch provided should be a direct substitution of the location code by the Locator.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nLet me examine the specific test for non-atomic migrations to understand the pattern:\n\n#TOOL_CALL

\n\n#REFLECT\nBased on the conversation summary and the test patterns I've examined, I now have a complete understanding of the bug and the solution needed:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n- The bug is in `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` at line 59\n- Current code: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic` \n- This only checks if the migration is atomic, but ignores whether the database supports transactional DDL\n- Should also check `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` like the migration executor does\n\n**Solution Pattern:**\n- From schema.py line 97: `self.atomic_migration = self.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl and atomic`\n- Need to change line 59 to: `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n**Test Patterns:**\n- Existing tests check for presence/absence of transaction SQL using `connection.ops.start_transaction_sql()` and `connection.ops.end_transaction_sql()`\n- Need to add a test that mocks `can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies no transaction wrappers are output\n\nI have sufficient information to identify the exact locations that need to be fixed. Let me provide the precise line ranges.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django sqlmigrate bug, I can identify the precise locations that need to be fixed:\n\n## Bug Locations\n\n**Primary Bug Location:**\n- **File:** `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n- **Lines:** 59-59 (single line fix)\n- **Issue:** Only checks `migration.atomic` but ignores `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n- **Current code:** `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`\n- **Required fix:** `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n\n**Test Enhancement Location:**\n- **File:** `/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py`  \n- **Lines:** 618-618 (add new test method after existing non-atomic test)\n- **Issue:** Missing test case for databases that don't support transactional DDL\n- **Required addition:** New test method that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies no transaction wrappers are output\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe bug occurs because `sqlmigrate` uses a different logic than the migration executor:\n- **Migration executor** (correct): Checks both `migration.atomic` AND `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`\n- **sqlmigrate command** (buggy): Only checks `migration.atomic`\n\nThis causes sqlmigrate to incorrectly wrap SQL output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements for databases that don't support transactional DDL operations, even when the actual migration executor wouldn't use transactions.\n\nThe fix aligns sqlmigrate's behavior with the migration executor by applying the same dual condition check found in `/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at line 97.\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the Django sqlmigrate bug, here are the precise locations that need to be addressed:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 59,\n            \"end_line\": 59\n        },\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 618,\n            \"end_line\": 618\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Location 1** contains the primary bug where `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic` needs to be changed to `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to match the migration executor's logic.\n\n**Location 2** is where a new test method should be added to verify the fix works correctly for databases that don't support transactional DDL by mocking `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl = False`.\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the codebase, here are the coordinated repair suggestions for the two interconnected bug locations:\n\n1. **[/root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py:59]**: Change the transaction output logic to match the migration executor's behavior by modifying:\n   ```python\n   # Current buggy code:\n   self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n   \n   # Fixed code:\n   self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n   ```\n   This ensures sqlmigrate uses the same dual condition check as the migration executor, preventing incorrect transaction wrappers for databases that don't support transactional DDL.\n\n2. **[/root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py:618]**: Add a new test method after the existing `test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration()` to verify the fix works correctly:\n   ```python\n   def test_sqlmigrate_for_non_ddl_rollback_database(self):\n       \"\"\"\n       Transaction wrappers aren't shown for databases that don't support DDL rollback.\n       \"\"\"\n       with mock.patch.object(connection.features, 'can_rollback_ddl', False):\n           out = io.StringIO()\n           call_command(\"sqlmigrate\", \"migrations\", \"0001\", stdout=out)\n           output = out.getvalue().lower()\n           queries = [q.strip() for q in output.splitlines()]\n           if connection.ops.start_transaction_sql():\n               self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.start_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)\n           self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.end_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)\n   ```\n   This test mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl = False` and verifies that no transaction SQL is output, complementing the existing test pattern while validating the fix from location 1.\n\nThese suggestions work in coordination: the code fix (1) implements the correct logic, while the test (2) ensures this logic works properly for databases that don't support transactional DDL, following the exact pattern described in the problem statement.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/django/django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py lines 59-59\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n\n\n[Location 2] /root/hy/projects_2/django/tests/migrations/test_commands.py lines 618-618\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\n#REFLECT\nLooking at the provided code segments and the problem statement, I can see:\n\n**Location 1**: Shows the exact buggy line `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic` that needs to be changed to include the `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` check.\n\n**Location 2**: Shows an empty line (618) where the new test method should be added.\n\nThe problem statement confirms exactly what needs to be done:\n1. Change sqlmigrate assignment of `self.output_transaction` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` as well\n2. Add a test that mocks `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to False\n\nBoth locations are precisely identified and match the suggestions provided. The fix is straightforward and well-defined.\n\n**CONTINUE TO FIX**\n\nYes, these locations are ready for fixing. \n\n**Location 1** contains the exact buggy line that needs to be modified from `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic` to `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n\n**Location 2** is the correct insertion point (after the existing non-atomic migration test) where the new test method should be added to verify the fix works for databases that don't support transactional DDL.\n\nThe problem statement clearly confirms these are the right locations and the suggested fixes align perfectly with the requirements.
