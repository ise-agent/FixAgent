What does this part of the code/file do?\n2. How does this part of code/file's behavior influence the failing test(s)?\n3. What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",

What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",

What is the relationship between this part of the code/file and the bug?\n\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",
    "response": "#REFLECT\nNow I have a clear understanding of the bug:\n\n**Current Problem:**\n1. The `register_hook` method (line 466) simply does `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`\n2. In the `__init__` method (lines 151-152), when processing hooks dictionary, it calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` where `v` could be a list of hooks\n3.

    "prompt": "Summary of conversation earlier: ## Summary: Bug Investigation in Requests Library\n\n### Main Objective\nThe task was to find and repair a bug in the requests project, specifically related to the hooks argument in the Request class.\n\n### Key Investigation Actions and Results\n\n1. **Project Structure Exploration**\n   - Explored the main project directory `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/`\n   - Identified the core `requests/` module containing the main codebase\n   - Located key files including `models.py` (containing the Request class) and `hooks.py`\n\n2. **Request Class Analysis**\n   - Found the Request class in `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py`\n   - Examined the `__init__` method (lines 48-67) which accepts a `hooks` parameter\n   - Identified the hooks initialization process (lines 143-152)\n\n3. **Bug Identification**\n   The bug was found in the hooks processing logic in the Request class `__init__` method:\n\n   **Current problematic code (lines 149-152):**\n   ```python\n   hooks = hooks or {}\n   \n   for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n       self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n   ```\n\n   **The Issue:** The code assumes that each hook value `v` is a single callable, but hooks can be passed as lists of callables. The `register_hook` method (line 466) simply does `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`, which would incorrectly append an entire list as a single element instead of extending the hooks list with individual callables.\n\n4. **Supporting Evidence**\n   - The `register_hook` method (lines 463-466) is designed to handle individual hooks: `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`\n   - The hooks initialization creates empty lists for each event: `self.hooks[event] = []` (line 147)\n   - This suggests hooks should be individual callables, not lists\n\n### Current Progress Status\n- **Completed:** Bug identification and root cause analysis\n- **Pending:** Implementation of the bug fix\n- **Issue:** The hooks parameter processing doesn't handle cases where hook values are lists of callables\n\n### Technical Details\n- **File:** `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py`\n- **Lines affected:** 149-152 (hooks processing in `__init__`)\n- **Root cause:** Incorrect assumption that hook values are always single callables\n- **Expected behavior:** Should handle both single callables and lists of callables for each hook event\n\n### Recommended Fix\nThe hooks processing loop should be modified to handle both single callables and lists of callables:\n\n```python\nhooks = hooks or {}\n\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    if hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not isinstance(v, (str, bytes)):\n        # v is a list/iterable of hooks\n        for hook in v:\n            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=hook)\n    else:\n        # v is a single hook\n        self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n```\n\nThis fix would ensure that both single hooks and lists of hooks are properly registered for each event type.\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I need to find the register_hook method to understand how it currently works and what the bug is.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"register_hook\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'register_hook' in file (showing first 3 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 149-155:\n 149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n 150: \n 151:         for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n 152:             self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n 153: \n 154:         #: Session.\n 155:         self.session = session\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 460-466:\n 460: \n 461:         return ''.join(url)\n 462: \n 463:     def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n 464:         \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n 465: \n 466:         self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 465-471:\n 465: \n 466:         self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n 467: \n 468:     def deregister_hook(self, event, hook):\n 469:         \"\"\"Deregister a previously registered hook.\n 470:         Returns True if the hook existed, False if not.\n 471:         \"\"\"\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nNow I understand the bug!

The `register_hook` method (line 466) simply does `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`, which would incorrectly append an entire list as a single element instead of extending the hooks list with individual callables.\n\n4. **Supporting Evidence**\n   - The `register_hook` method (lines 463-466) is designed to handle individual hooks: `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`\n   - The hooks initialization creates empty lists for each event: `self.hooks[event] = []` (line 147)\n   - This suggests hooks should be individual callables, not lists\n\n### Current Progress Status\n- **Completed:** Bug identification and root cause analysis\n- **Pending:** Implementation of the bug fix\n- **Issue:** The hooks parameter processing doesn't handle cases where hook values are lists of callables\n\n### Technical Details\n- **File:** `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py`\n- **Lines affected:** 149-152 (hooks processing in `__init__`)\n- **Root cause:** Incorrect assumption that hook values are always single callables\n- **Expected behavior:** Should handle both single callables and lists of callables for each hook event\n\n### Recommended Fix\nThe hooks processing loop should be modified to handle both single callables and lists of callables:\n\n```python\nhooks = hooks or {}\n\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    if hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not isinstance(v, (str, bytes)):\n        # v is a list/iterable of hooks\n        for hook in v:\n            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=hook)\n    else:\n        # v is a single hook\n        self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n```\n\nThis fix would ensure that both single hooks and lists of hooks are properly registered for each event type.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\nStart line: 151\nEnd line: 152\n\nTry to find and repair the bug in the project.\nNow I need to find the register_hook method to understand how it currently works and what the bug is.\n\n#TOOL_CALL search_code_with_context { \"keyword\": \"register_hook\", \"search_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\" }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nSearch results for 'register_hook' in file (showing first 3 matches):\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 149-155:\n 149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n 150: \n 151:         for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n 152:             self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n 153: \n 154:         #: Session.\n 155:         self.session = session\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 460-466:\n 460: \n 461:         return ''.join(url)\n 462: \n 463:     def register_hook(self, event, hook):\n 464:         \"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\n 465: \n 466:         self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n\n================================================================================\n\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\nLines 465-471:\n 465: \n 466:         self.hooks[event].append(hook)\n 467: \n 468:     def deregister_hook(self, event, hook):\n 469:         \"\"\"Deregister a previously registered hook.\n 470:         Returns True if the hook existed, False if not.\n 471:         \"\"\"\n\n================================================================================\n\n\nNow I understand the bug!

The `register_hook` method (line 466) simply does `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`\n2. In the `__init__` method (lines 151-152), when processing hooks dictionary, it calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` where `v` could be a list of hooks\n3. If `v` is a list of hook functions, `register_hook` will append the entire list as a single element to `self.hooks[event]`, instead of adding each hook individually\n4. Later when hooks are executed, the code tries to call the list as if it were a function, which fails\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nThe hooks parameter should accept both single callables and lists of callables as values, with lists being properly expanded into individual hook registrations.\n\n**Bug Location:**\nThe bug is in the hooks processing loop in the Request `__init__` method at lines 151-152. The fix needs to check if the hook value is a list and handle it appropriately.\n\nLet me examine the hooks initialization to understand the complete context.\n\n#TOOL_CALL read_file_lines { \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\", \"start_line\": 140, \"end_line\": 155 }\n/\\/ Tool Result:\nFile: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\nTotal lines: 888\nShowing lines 140-155:\n\n 140:         #: True if Request has been sent.\n 141:         self.sent = False\n 142: \n 143:         #: Event-handling hooks.\n 144:         self.hooks = {}\n 145: \n 146:         for event in HOOKS:\n 147:             self.hooks[event] = []\n 148: \n 149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n 150: \n 151:         for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n 152:             self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n 153: \n 154:         #: Session.\n 155:         self.session = session\n\nPerfect! Now I have all the context I need. The bug is clearly identified:\n\n**Bug Analysis:**\n1. **Location:** Lines 151-152 in `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py`\n2. **Problem:** The hooks processing loop assumes each hook value is a single callable, but users should be able to pass lists of callables\n3. **Current behavior:** When a list is passed as a hook value, `register_hook` appends the entire list as one element, creating a nested list structure\n4. **Expected behavior:** Lists should be unpacked and each callable registered individually\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe code at lines 151-152:\n```python\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n```\n\nShould handle the case where `v` is a list of callables, not just a single callable.\n\n**Fix Required:**\nThe loop needs to check if `v` is iterable (but not a string) and register each hook individually if it's a list, or register the single hook if it's not a list.\n\n**Precise Bug Locations:**\n1. **Primary location:** Lines 151-152 - The hooks processing loop that needs to handle both single callables and lists of callables\n\n**INFO ENOUGH**\n\nThe bug is located at lines 151-152 in `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py` where the hooks parameter processing fails to handle lists of hook functions properly. The fix needs to modify this loop to detect when a hook value is a list and register each hook individually rather than registering the entire list as a single hook.\nIf you think current information is enough to understand the root cause of the bug, add 'PROPOSE LOCATION' in your response to propose your location.\nPROPOSE LOCATION\n\nBased on my analysis of the bug described in the problem statement, I have identified the exact location where the issue occurs. The problem is in the Request class `__init__` method where it processes the hooks dictionary parameter.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\nThe bug is in lines 151-152 of `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py` where the hooks processing loop calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` for each key-value pair in the hooks dictionary. When `v` is a list of hook functions, `register_hook` appends the entire list as a single element to `self.hooks[event]`, creating a nested list structure that fails when hooks are executed (since lists are not callable).\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe hooks processing loop needs to be modified to detect when a hook value is a list and register each hook function individually, rather than registering the entire list as a single hook.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 151,\n            \"end_line\": 152\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",

When `v` is a list of hook functions, `register_hook` appends the entire list as a single element to `self.hooks[event]`, creating a nested list structure that fails when hooks are executed (since lists are not callable).\n\n**The Fix Needed:**\nThe hooks processing loop needs to be modified to detect when a hook value is a list and register each hook function individually, rather than registering the entire list as a single hook.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\n            \"file_path\": \"/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\",\n            \"start_line\": 151,\n            \"end_line\": 152\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nPROPOSE SUGGESTIONS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the code, I have identified the exact issue and can provide a precise fix. The bug is in the hooks processing loop in the Request `__init__` method at lines 151-152.\n\n**Current Problem:**\nThe hooks processing loop assumes each hook value is a single callable, but when users pass a list of hook functions, `register_hook` appends the entire list as one element, creating a nested list structure that fails during execution.\n\n**Fix Required:**\nThe loop needs to be modified to handle both single callables and lists of callables properly.\n\n1. **[Lines 151-152]**: Replace the current hooks processing loop with logic that detects when a hook value is a list and registers each hook individually:\n\n```python\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    if hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not isinstance(v, (str, bytes)):\n        # v is a list/iterable of hooks\n        for hook in v:\n            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=hook)\n    else:\n        # v is a single hook\n        self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n```\n\nThis fix:\n- Preserves backward compatibility (single hooks still work)\n- Enables the desired functionality (lists of hooks are properly registered)\n- Uses the existing `register_hook` method correctly\n- Avoids treating strings/bytes as iterables (which would break them into individual characters)\n- Maintains the framework's design pattern of using `register_hook` for all hook registrations\n\nThe solution allows users to pass hooks like `{'response': [hook1, hook2, hook3]}` and have each hook properly registered, eliminating the need for manual multiple `register_hook` calls.\nAccording to the suggestions provided earlier, please review the following code segments:\n\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py lines 151-152\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n\n\nBased on the suggestion, do you think these locations are ready for fixing?\nIf yes, please respond with '**CONTINUE TO FIX**' and then you will switch to Fixer state, proceed to implement the fix later.\nIf not, explain why and state that further clarification is needed.\nThe problem statement the project is:\nAllow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",

The `register_hook` method (line 466) simply does `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`, which would incorrectly append an entire list as a single element instead of extending the hooks list with individual callables.\n\n4. **Supporting Evidence**\n   - The `register_hook` method (lines 463-466) is designed to handle individual hooks: `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`\n   - The hooks initialization creates empty lists for each event: `self.hooks[event] = []` (line 147)\n   - This suggests hooks should be individual callables, not lists\n\n### Current Progress Status\n- **Completed:** Bug identification and root cause analysis\n- **Pending:** Implementation of the bug fix\n- **Issue:** The hooks parameter processing doesn't handle cases where hook values are lists of callables\n\n### Technical Details\n- **File:** `/root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py`\n- **Lines affected:** 149-152 (hooks processing in `__init__`)\n- **Root cause:** Incorrect assumption that hook values are always single callables\n- **Expected behavior:** Should handle both single callables and lists of callables for each hook event\n\n### Recommended Fix\nThe hooks processing loop should be modified to handle both single callables and lists of callables:\n\n```python\nhooks = hooks or {}\n\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    if hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not isinstance(v, (str, bytes)):\n        # v is a list/iterable of hooks\n        for hook in v:\n            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=hook)\n    else:\n        # v is a single hook\n        self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n```\n\nThis fix would ensure that both single hooks and lists of hooks are properly registered for each event type.\nSuspicious location by the Locator:\nPath: /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py\nStart line: 151\nEnd line: 152\n\nCurrent suggestions by the suggester:\nS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the code, I have identified the exact issue and can provide a precise fix.

The `register_hook` method (line 466) simply does `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`\n2. In the `__init__` method (lines 151-152), when processing hooks dictionary, it calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` where `v` could be a list of hooks\n3. If `v` is a list of hook functions, `register_hook` will append the entire list as a single element to `self.hooks[event]`, instead of adding each hook individually\n4. Later when hooks are executed, the code tries to call the list as if it were a function, which fails\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nThe hooks parameter should accept both single callables and lists of callables as values, with lists being properly expanded into individual hook registrations.\n\n**Bug Location:**\nThe bug is in the hooks processing loop in the Request `__init__` method at lines 151-152.

The suggestion provides a complete and technically sound solution that:\n\n1. **Addresses the root cause**: The current code assumes hook values are always single callables, but the fix properly handles both single callables and lists of callables.\n\n2. **Maintains backward compatibility**: Single hook functions will continue to work exactly as before.\n\n3. **Implements the desired feature**: Users can now pass `{'response': [hook1, hook2, hook3]}` and each hook will be properly registered.\n\n4. **Uses proper type checking**: The `hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not isinstance(v, (str, bytes))` check correctly identifies iterables while avoiding the pitfall of treating strings as character lists.\n\n5. **Leverages existing infrastructure**: The fix uses the existing `register_hook` method, maintaining the framework's design patterns.\n\nThe location at lines 151-152 is the exact spot where the bug occurs, and the suggested modification will resolve the issue completely while preserving all existing functionality.\n[Location 1] /root/hy/projects_2/requests/requests/models.py lines 151-152\n\nImports in this file: You can select the functions that may be needed to assist with the repair.\n  import os\n  import socket\n  from datetime import datetime\n  from io import BytesIO\n  from .hooks import dispatch_hook, HOOKS\n  from .structures import CaseInsensitiveDict\n  from .status_codes import codes\n  from .auth import HTTPBasicAuth, HTTPProxyAuth\n  from .cookies import cookiejar_from_dict, extract_cookies_to_jar, get_cookie_header\n  from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import MaxRetryError, LocationParseError\n  from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import TimeoutError\n  from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import SSLError as _SSLError\n  from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as _HTTPError\n  from .packages.urllib3 import connectionpool, poolmanager\n  from .packages.urllib3.filepost import encode_multipart_formdata\n  from .defaults import SCHEMAS\n  from .exceptions import (\n  from .utils import (\n  from .compat import (\n  from given response.\n\nWhen generating patches, **do NOT add duplicate imports** that already exist in the above list.\n\nThe following is the code content with context ([R] marks vulnerability lines, [C] marks context lines):\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[C]  141:         self.sent = False\n[C]  142: \n[C]  143:         #: Event-handling hooks.\n[C]  144:         self.hooks = {}\n[C]  145: \n[C]  146:         for event in HOOKS:\n[C]  147:             self.hooks[event] = []\n[C]  148: \n[C]  149:         hooks = hooks or {}\n[C]  150: \n[R]  151:         for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n[R]  152:             self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n[C]  153: \n[C]  154:         #: Session.\n[C]  155:         self.session = session\n[C]  156: \n[C]  157:         #: SSL Verification.\n[C]  158:         self.verify = verify\n[C]  159: \n[C]  160:         #: SSL Certificate\n[C]  161:         self.cert = cert\n[C]  162: \n\nYou must pay close attention to **indentation** — especially the relative indentation level between the patch and its parent scope (for example, the containing class or function).\n⚠️ **Observe the leading whitespace of the content above** and indent your patch to match its context; do not always produce flush-left code.\n⚠️ **Do not combine fixes for different locations into one block** — every location's fix should be in a **separate** ```python```code block.\n\nHere are the suggestions from the Suggester:\nS\n\nBased on the problem statement and my analysis of the code, I have identified the exact issue and can provide a precise fix.
